I feel so low. I'm 22f and i've exhausted all of my options but to no avail. I was dropped from IAPT (a talking therapy in the UK) due to me becoming suicidal again, apparently they don't help suicidal people. My mum is paying for my EMDR which i'm currently doing, and it's helping with my PTSD, but not my depression, anxiety, insomnia etc. 

I've become a loner. I spend my days indoors and haven't spoken to my friends in weeks. I've shut all my friends out and come up with excuses as to why I can't go out with them. I've noticed i'm starting to shut my family out too. After 2 years I finally got a job offer and was meant to start in 3 weeks, but because I failed my driving test they're going to rescind the offer.

I've gotten myself into over £5k worth of debt admittedly due to drugs and my bank contacted me this morning to say I have three weeks to pay off the debt or they'll begin to charge interest. 

I've started cutting again. I cut in places people won't see and i've gone crazy with it. Thankfully alcohol isn't an addiction anymore but i'd be lying if I said I don't crave it everyday, and living in a house with people that still drink is difficult to say the least.

After my bad reaction with sertraline (and my overdose), my GP (doctor) refuses to prescribe me with antidepressants. I'm scared to talk to mental health hotlines such as SHOUT because the last time I contacted them they sent an ambulance to my house despite assuring them beforehand that I was not suicidal or in any danger.

There was this guy I started to like cause he was so handsome and friendly to me. I tried to keep my love in secret but it was hard for me while he seemed for me to like me back, I was just blind I guess. last year I tried to do more with him after work, so we played GTA together or with his friends and sometimes my friends went to the parties of his friends and we hung up together. At the beginning of the year we went to a club together and after a short time most of our friends went home and we were 3 persons left on the dancefloor. That was the point where I slightly noticed he could be hetero cause he was looking to the girls out there and that was hard for me. I told them I have to go home and on my way I wrote him on whatsapp we have to talk. Some days later he stood in front of me and I tried to tell him how I feel but I was to shy/nervous to tell him so I went home and wrote him on whatsapp (yes not brave at all) how I felt. I called my best friend to tell him what ""person x"" answers me. And suddenly there where the answer and he wrote ""It's no problem for him but he just likes girls"".

,depression_help,"PS: I never got to do my Spanish due on homework on May 4th 2023.

Then.. The day we would be leaving the city forever came on May 6th 2023, we packed all our suitcases and left early in the morning around 7AM and boarded the EMR 222 express service to London St pancras then I remember when we boarded the train quickly departed ( because its an express ) and i was really sad knowing I would never be able to see any of this again. Funny enough, when we were passing by the Airport parkway, I saw a ryanair 737 at 500 feet enroute to the nearest Airport ( I was a very huge aviation fan back then ) and I remember being sort of happy. Then 2 hours later we arrived in London and I remember we went downstairs to catch a Thameslink. We got off a few stops before that before heading into my first house… My mum had a friend which had 3 children and when we got into her small house, All I could think about is this would be my life now… Funny enough the pastoral team was dealing with us in my school and was concerned for me because our family was moving too much. You wouldn't even believe that my mum blocked ALL of them ( she didn't block the school ) then a few days later my mum got fed up of living with her friend so we went to a hotel and  during   our time at that hotel my mum signed out of our old city and called my school saying I would never be returning back.. Which suddenly, they alerted the pastoral team and such and we got a message saying to tell us our location ( cause my mum literally made us go into hiding ) so nobody knew where we were which was super stupid of her. My mum said she would not be revealing where we are staying and will be blocking the number. Which she did. At that time, my phone had issues with turning on so I couldn't get my phone to turn on so I could see what my friends had to say about me. And a few days later, I got the phone to work and I saw all the messages from my friends asking if I was alive and why i had suddenly disappeared and never came back. I’ll never forget this text message from one of my friends. “ At first, we thought you were sick, but then  you never came back… “ I was really sad as well and even my crush who i talked to for 1-2 days just had completely ghosted me since then even though we had a strong relationship and friendship. Then a few days later we moved to another hotel which we got a message saying that the police would be getting involved with our case, which my mum blocked the number and ranted to her friends about how “ crazy “ my old school was for doing something like this. I honestly believe SHE is the crazy one!

,depression_help,"I’m not exactly the one going through a depressive episode currently, at least I don’t think. Just struggling a little. My spouse is going through one and it’s unlike any other I’ve seen in her before. We’ve been through a lot, but haven’t seen her this low before and I’m scared and don’t know what to do. She says she needs her space and doesn’t want to talk to me about anything and I try to respect her wishes as much as possible but I’ve gotten to the point where I’m suffering from it as well. Is it selfish of me to feel that way? I’ve felt so alone and useless. She leaves every evening saying she’s going out with friends or going for a walk that sometimes lasts 3-4 hours and I end up left alone, spending time with our kids after dinner and before bed. I end up getting them ready for bed and in bed and they’re suffering as well because they aren’t getting their fix for her. They’ve been a mess lately because they know something is wrong and not going well. I’m left spending my nights alone and having to go to sleep alone (which I absolutely hate). I try my best to stay up and wait for her but I have work early and can’t sustain staying up past midnight every night.

Just struggling a little. My spouse is going through one and it’s unlike any other I’ve seen in her before. We’ve been through a lot, but haven’t seen her this low before and I’m scared and don’t know what to do. She says she needs her space and doesn’t want to talk to me about anything and I try to respect her wishes as much as possible but I’ve gotten to the point where I’m suffering from it as well. Is it selfish of me to feel that way? I’ve felt so alone and useless. She leaves every evening saying she’s going out with friends or going for a walk that sometimes lasts 3-4 hours and I end up left alone, spending time with our kids after dinner and before bed. I end up getting them ready for bed and in bed and they’re suffering as well because they aren’t getting their fix for her. They’ve been a mess lately because they know something is wrong and not going well. I’m left spending my nights alone and having to go to sleep alone (which I absolutely hate). I try my best to stay up and wait for her but I have work early and can’t sustain staying up past midnight every night.

The past year I have been ate with the thought of that I DONT want to grow up..I dont want my family to grow up.  Why? --- I Dont want my kids to grow up and leave one day. I dont want my parents to get older. I Dont want anything to happen to my wife or I.  Why? --- I dont feel like i would ever get to experience these things or moments ever again, be it this time again one day in this life or the after. But how do I know that we wont get these experiences again? --- I dont know that I wont. I mean I love the little voices of my children now, the sweet little silly things they do and say, my parents (their grandparents) enjoying these these things, and I really miss the smaller stages. I feel like I missed it by how quick it flew by.

Its like I feel like we are just bits of sand in a hourglass, and the time is just running out non stop. Every day that passes, its like the sand drops faster and faster.

Am I taking everything in with my all? Did I take in everything in the past with my all? If not, I cant go back to be able to. My memory doesnt let me recall what I feel is enough to confirm that I did indeed live in the present through the stages to where we are now.

I cant go back and recreate those exact times \\ feelings \\ memories. I cant go back and right my wrongs. The bits and peices I have are my faint memory and captured videos and pictures. I have a problem with letting things go. I hold on to inanimate objects that have any sort of relation to those special times or memories or baby and toddler stages.(toys, books, clothes, anything...It could be junk). It pains me to think about letting these things go, never to be seen again. It feels like a part of me and these special times, leaves as well.

Why cant I look at these past experiences with 100% happiness? They were happy moments not meant to be seen as sad because they are gone.

I should feel lucky that I get to experience anything. Many husbands / wives / parents never make it to get to experience the things I have. To my knowledge everyone around me is happy and healthy. Tons of people cant say that. Everyone is meant to grow. Us. Our children. Our parents. Everything. Many dont get to see this growth. Be happy. Why cant I now?

I am a Christian. Not a great one, but I am. Is this happening because Its like I am not sure if this is all we get? Why do I have any sort of doubt that we wont live forever and Ill be able to be with my loved ones eternal? I doubt and question everything I cant see or do not understand. How do people have that 100% faith? Would I be and feel better if I did?

Its a little more calming to think that there is the 50% chance that we do indeed all get the chance to be together eternally. I have been blessed beyond belief with a beautiful and loving wife, amazing children, great family, and all my needs always met. It urks me to think that I wouldnt have all of this forever. But I may?

The unknown. Is that what this all boils down to? Does this cause the constant battle in my mind and body?

Is this depression? It really all hit hard and started after this past Christmas when my first baby finally stopped believing in Santa and I realized life is moving forward.

&lt;p&gt;I should feel lucky that I get to experience anything. Many husbands / wives / parents never make it to get to experience the things I have. To my knowledge everyone around me is happy and healthy. Tons of people cant say that. Everyone is meant to grow. Us. Our children. Our parents. Everything. Many dont get to see this growth. Be happy. Why cant I now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Christian. Not a great one, but I am. Is this happening because Its like I am not sure if this is all we get? Why do I have any sort of doubt that we wont live forever and Ill be able to be with my loved ones eternal? I doubt and question everything I cant see or do not understand. How do people have that 100% faith? Would I be and feel better if I did?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its a little more calming to think that there is the 50% chance that we do indeed all get the chance to be together eternally. I have been blessed beyond belief with a beautiful and loving wife, amazing children, great family, and all my needs always met. It urks me to think that I wouldnt have all of this forever. But I may?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unknown. Is that what this all boils down to? Does this cause the constant battle in my mind and body?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this depression? It really all hit hard and started after this past Christmas when my first baby finally stopped believing in Santa and I realized life is moving forward. Help! i cry often when no one is around, just because of the way i feel and how it doesnt leave me alone. I wish these feelings on no one.&lt;/p&gt;

What I find most helpful is that I can vent or process my emotions without the worry of impacting family or friends with my negative thoughts.

,depression_help,"I (26 F) have struggled with depression and suicidal ideation for half of my life. 

I’m not currently in therapy due to financial reasons, but I was with one therapist for 4 years and she at one point recommended that I seek inpatient treatment. She basically forced me to go to the emergency room to be evaluated and I ended up avoiding being admitted and we continued on with our sessions like normal until I couldn’t afford to see her anymore last summer. 

Fast forward to now: 

My life has basically imploded. I’ve been dealing with numerous health and financial issues that have left me constantly broke, stressed and overwhelmed beyond comprehension. My depression has become more severe than it has ever been over the past few months and I’ve been struggling with a new symptom that I’ve never really had before: *Apathy*

I’ve basically given up on life. Nothing excites me or interests me. There are HUGE issues in my life (constantly unable to pay my rent, health issues are getting worse, etc…) that I just don’t care about anymore, which is scaring me. I used to do everything in my power to change my situation and now I couldn’t care less about anything. 

It’s gotten to a point where the promises Ive made to myself about not ending my life are no longer keeping me from going over the edge. I’m justifying suicide in ways that I *never* have before and I’m truly afraid that I will take my life in the very near future if I don’t seek a higher level of care. 

My question is: Is there any way for me to be approved for residential treatment even though I’ve never attempted and have never been hospitalized? I was genuinely about to admit myself to the psych ward, but ultimately decided against it because of all of the horror stories I’ve heard about it. 

I’m now trying to go straight to residential, hopefully with a recommendation through the outpatient program that I’m currently in. 

Has anyone here ever been enrolled in residential treatment without any prior attempts/hospitalizations? 

I truly feel that residential treatment is the right step for me to get my life back on track, but I’m just wondering how difficult it may be based on the fact that I haven’t had any tangible severe crises outside of my therapy sessions.

Hi. I (21F) have suffered with many different mental health conditions since I was a child. I won’t go into detail about my past because I don’t think outside of therapy it has much of an impact on the advice I am seeking.

I feel like I am in a constant state of freeze. I’m always tired, can sleep all day, only overeat, I feel like I am so far removed from the last time I recognized myself but don’t know how to get back to being whatever the new version of myself is because I struggle to just get out of bed.

How do I start living life again? Getting out of bed? Going outside? Doing the little simple tasks that I should’ve done months ago that I know would make me feel better? 

Please give me any advice that has worked for you. Even if it is simply “Get up and do it.” Trust me I need to hear it. And thank you for reading :)

I was diagnosed with GAD and Depression in 2014 while in college (definitely had it way before then). Fast forward to now, I'm 32 and was recently was diagnosed officially with ADHD, something I thought I had as a kid but was always dismissed which I think also led to a lot of the depression that I suffered from. 

I've got two kids under 3 and a great and supportive wife who I have a great relationship with. I started a new job this year which has been great. But I often feel overwhelmed, and I worry constantly that I'm not doing a good job and will be fired. My manager isn't as welcoming as I'm used to and its very hard to read him. This has cast a lot of additional stress on me. 

  
Early Wednesday morning (4am) I woke up sweating profusely, my heart was racing and I felt very dehydrated. I thought I was having a panic attack which I haven't had one in two years. I've really been working hard on my mental health and overall was working very well. 

I tried to drink some water and immediately threw up. I think I ended up getting a 24 hour stomach bug, but I spent the rest of Wednesday in bed with body pains and chills (no fever). It couldn't have been a worse time because I had so much work to do.  I feel like this year I've been nothing but sick. Our kids are in preschool and we've managed to have everything under the sun this year. Its been daunting and often when we've tried to have vacations its often been sideline due to illness. I'm normally pretty healthy and only get sick 1-2 times a year. 

  
All this has put me into a very bad head space. I'm stressed with work, the ADHA medication has helped but I don't think I have the necessary tools in place to effectively work. Being sick again has just really got me down, and the thought that I might have had a panic attack for the first time in a very long time has kind of sent me spirally.

,depression_help,"Apologies for using a meme word, but I mean it.

I have depression and anxiety. I have also been deeply entrenched in election news for the past couple months. When I get anxious, I try to do research to alleviate that anxiety, but the current political/media landscape is built so much on gaining clicks that everything has been ramped up to apocalyptic hyperbole and it's impossible to get a measured answer.

I'm trying to remain optimistic that Harris will win despite the polls (presidential polls have been wrong debatable all the way back to 2012), but I still want a pragmatic answer of what to expect in the event of a worst case scenario.

I don't believe that Trump will become an autocrat (as much as he wants to be); I find it highly unlikely that an incompetent, lazy man pushing 80 could undo nearly 250 years of democracy in 4 years. But I am worried about the sliding scale, and things he could realistically achieve in the short term. I want to have faith in state-level governments (especially with more and more republicans turning on him), the judicial branch, and organizations such as ACLU.

I live in Tennessee (not by choice) and just up and moving to a blue state is not feasible with my current financial situation. Most of my family are republicans, I don't discuss this with them. Nearly all of my friends are somewhere on the LGBT spectrum (I suspect I might be too) and spread out across the country, and I don't want to see them get hurt by people who don't give a shit about them.

The election is *always* in the back of my mind. I can lose hours of the day just doomscrolling in an attempt to find something concrete and reassuring. I've lost pleasure in hobbies. Lately, it's been difficult to find any joy or enthusiasm for anything when it feels like there's a 50/50 chance the world could end in two weeks (I know that's not literally what will happen, but it sure feels like it).

,depression_help,"From the outside looking in, my life is so great. I worked so hard to get my M.Ed and credential to be a school counselor and for years, being a school counselor was my dream job. I got hired at a wealthy school district and am making enough money to afford my own very spacious one-bedroom apartment plus all of my many expenses and still have money left over. I have friends and a family that love me and I have been achieving some success in my writing career over the past few years. 

In 2018 when I was at my lowest I got 5150'd twice but through that process I received the proper diagnosis and troubleshooted the right meds until I finally got on my current combination about two years ago. I haven't been suicidal since 2021 but back then I had a job that I hated so I had something very tangible to be miserable about. I don't think I'm manic now and I haven't really experienced a true manic episode since late 2019 but I am just so sad. My job isn't hard but it isn't always engaging but sometimes it can be hard to deal with the pressure of wanting to do an amazing job in a career that I desired for so long. 

I just feel so sad all the time. About a year ago I ended a 10 month relationship and it left me with so much baggage. I felt like the most unloveable girl in the world and these days I still do. Shortly afterwards I embarked on many many MANY rebounds and met someone that I am probably still in love with but the situation there is currently just Complicated. I don't think I've dealt with the baggage that my relationship left me with and I did make a therapy appointment a few months ago but I didn't vibe with the therapist and I felt like she was judging me for being so hung up on all this baggage. I do have really good insurance now through my fancy new job and I made a therapy appointment for tomorrow with a different therapist. 

Is this all there is to life? Waking up at dawn every day to go to a job that you mostly like but isn't quite the dream job you imagined it to be. Sleep all weekend to make it all go away. Rinse and repeat. I know no one can fix me but sometimes I feel like it would be so nice to meet someone who can. In the words of Phoebe Bridgers, ""I don't want to be alone anymore.""

,depression_help,"Hello, my name is Valentin, I'm nearly 24 and I feel like I'm wasting my life because of this problem.

Quite simply, I feel like an alien in the eyes of others (family, friends, colleagues). I notice it quite easily in the looks on their faces when I speak and in the ""yea good 🙂"" answers I sometimes get.

To be honest, I've been pretty reserved since high school and I think it shows no matter what I try to do. I find it really hard to speak up, especially in large groups or in noisy environments.

I also really feel like I'm not normal in appearance, maybe in body language or facial expressions, but I feel weird myself and never at ease...
Since last year, I've been trying to improve my appearance, thinking it would make me a bit more sociable, but it's no use, I don't fit in at all. Maybe I'm just uptight or don't know how to have fun. I'd so much rather enjoy life, make friends, go out and just be happy :/.

I just don't understand why I'm so different from other people and why they look at me like that. Solving this problem would make me so happy.

The amount of guilt I have to carry is so heavy I&amp;#39;m exhausted thinking let alone living: I don&amp;#39;t want to open up because I don&amp;#39;t want to be a problem they have to fix but its so lonely being so tired, I avoid asking for help because I don&amp;#39;t actually know what is &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot; but I so angry no one has even questioned the drastic change in every aspect of my life, I have some amazing friends and family that would do anything they can to help but I don&amp;#39;t want to reach a point where they are tired of having to always help me, I&amp;#39;m terrified my husband will wake up and be tired of putting up with me and hell leave but I get so frustrated because I don&amp;#39;t want to be like this anymore than he does, I want to go to counseling or have meds that actually help take some weight off so I at least have a chance to live again but I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain its not the sad that the issue its the tired. Ive hit a point where im just so deeply tired. I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain to people that my existence is tired, no sleep or relaxation or &amp;quot;recharging&amp;quot; is going to help because its like my soul is tired. I don&amp;#39;t know how to stop the feeling of isolation. I don&amp;#39;t reach out and neither does anyone else which is lonely, I don&amp;#39;t tell and people don&amp;#39;t ask which is lonely, I drift away because I don&amp;#39;t think they want me and they don&amp;#39;t pull me back because everyone has their own life which feels lonely. I&amp;#39;m stuck frozen doing nothing because I know its not their job but I should matter enough. I&amp;#39;m tired and lonely but I&amp;#39;m scared to be alone.   &lt;/p&gt;

My physical condition is also not so good, im currently being tested for any illnesses or other things like that. Everything combined with being transgender, autistic and my kitty dying 3 weeks ago. Ive been feeling shitty overall, but i wanna stay strong and keep going.
I was on my way to the canteen when i tripped on the stairs and twisted my ankle and now I have two permanently damaged legs. I really hope I can walk again tomorrow but it probably won't happen... I was also supposed to participate in an important maths contest i really looked forward to, but the opportunity flew by.
My grades are really slipping. I used to be a top, straight-A student and now? Okay, my grades are still good. But it feels so wrong to not be the best, especially when all teachers put so much pressure on you since your mother is a teacher. Ive got a polish, german, chemistry, maths, social studies and english tests coming up in the next 2 weeks. Ill probably need to stay home so.. when exactly am i going to write all of this? 2nd terms exist, but by the time i come back there will be 2 times the amount of tests... i also keep all of my textbooks and notebooks in my locker and i cant really access it, so i cant even study. I already feel like im falling behind so much.. and as someone who is deadly afraid of the future AND as someone who writes their finals in just 7 months - i feel like im going to fail and not be accepted into my ""dream"" school. Its not actually a dream because there is only one school in the whole town, and im afraid of moving out. 
Im not sure what to do now. Teachers always scare us how adult life is shit, AI will replace us all and no one will be working for our retirement. I am so afraid of that and I'll probably end up working a 9 to 5 with minimal wage.. if this will happen anyway, why am I trying now? Ill just end up being lonely and no one will remember me. Autism isn't helping, I can never really force myself to go out of my comfort zone and talk to someone or even look up (because then there is a chance that i will make eye contact, this is probably the reason of my shrimp posture). People at school (okay maybe like 2 people that hate me) will laugh at me for falling off the stairs. I'll probably end up walking with a cane for the rest of my life because of some sort of EDS and migranes, so maybe i should just get used to it now.

sorry if its not really fitting into this sub, i feel like this looks like a normal vent and not depression struggles.

Things have gotten so bad lately that I've been seriously considering drastic measures again, just to make the pain stop.

,depression_help,"Hello,

I have been on this depression/aniety mental health journey for quite some time now. My general symptoms are that I cant get up in the morning(late to work often), right after work I come home and take 2-3 hour nap, wake up eat and go back to sleep. No motivation to improve my life(gym,meetings ect). During work I am very uncomfortable and keep to myself, avoiding social interaction. I make good money but hate being at my job, mainly beccause I dont like to be around people.  I cannot keep or form new relationships in my life, very anti-social but its the one thing I desperately want/need. I am losing weight have a hard time keeping healthy. Isolate is all I do. I use alcohol other substances on occasion, not daily I will get more into that later.

  
My background -

I have been clean off Fentanyl &amp; Meth for almost a year, but I do take Suboxone 4MG daily. I have been an addict for the majority of my life, I am 36 started shooting heroin/meth @ 21. I have been attempting to get sober for almost a decade off and on, getting a few months sober here and there. I have been to over 21 treatment centers. When I was 21 I got my Jaw broken 2 times within 1 year peroid, which was very traumatic. It causes me to suffer from body dismorphia and a host of other PTSD symptoms. My childhood was very traumatic as well, both parents alcoholics and very abusive, dont want to get into too much doom and gloom but I get a host of self esteem and Adbandoment issues from them which add to my depression. 

I have been on a host of SSRI and SNRI everythig from Lexapro, Effexor, Prozac, Trintellex, Welbutrin, Zoloft, Lithium and others as well nothing gave me promising results without side effects. I have Ulcerative Colitis and they cause me to flare up.  I am currently just taking the Suboxone 4mg and looking to possible try to add ADHD medications since its the only thing I have not tried yet. I think doing so much meth in my days I have burnt my dopamine receptors and am afraid ADHD meds might be the only thing to give me happiness/motivation to live a good  life. 

Does anyone have any suggestions as far as medications/natural supplements or therapy suggestions/experience in this scenario? Any help suggestions, feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you

I would give anything to either die or stop feeling this way. The main thing that bothers me is that i have NO reason to be feeling this way??? I constantly feel selfish for having these sort of thoughts while knowing that people have it way worse than i do.

,depression_help,"My parent’s outlook on education has been the reason I can’t escape depression.



When I was in elementary school, I took some retarded 20 question test about patterns and shapes, and that ended up determining me as a “gifted” student. I would get out of class every day to go with a gifted teacher and I would do more complex writing assignments. 

This made my parents genuinely believe that their son was some sort of freak of nature in terms of intelligence. All they did was brag about how I’m a child genius and that everything I do in school is perfect and I’m on track to amazing things.

Once middle school came around I started to struggle a little bit for the first time, in math. This struggle was blamed completely on me, that I was being lazy, that I didn’t care about what mattered, that I’m a genius and I just don’t want to see my own potential.

There were so many nights where I was hyperventilating and sobbing after being yelled at over this stuff, yea I was a bit overdramatic, but I felt like a failure and hated how I had to put so much time into things that just stress me out and don’t even directly benefit me. I’ll never forget how the first time I got a B as a 9-weeks overall grade, they hired a tutor over the entire summer so I wasn’t behind the next year.

But sure enough, eventually the struggle came back. They kept telling me to enter the hardest classes I possibly could because they knew I was “by far smart enough” to do them. And once again my grades stooped even more, and at the time my friends who were good at math made fun of me and rubbed it in more.

I dropped out of harder classes because I figured it’d get me on track, and for a few years it worked, but once again I’m struggling so much in math because I took too hard of a class. I’m also in an online writing class I just cannot keep up with all of this work. I’ve been trying to improve myself physically and mentally, how can I make myself do this work that feels so utterly pointless?

The benefit is a pat on the back from my parents and a good number on a screen. I feel no accomplishment in my success from this damn school system, nor have I ever.

I wanted a job, but my mom wouldn’t let me because I “need to focus on school”. Hell, if I had a job I probably would’ve fucking killed myself by now cause I’d actually have no time.

I’m going to math tutoring multiple times a week for my mom, but it’s never enough. She wants me to go every day if I could. She monitors all of my grades, checking them multiple times a day and interrogating me about them.

I have so many missing assignments in my classes, I just can’t keep up. I don’t even want to try anymore. I’m working myself to complete mental fatigue, for what? Money? Nope. Confidence? Nope. Peace? Nope. Just to climb another rung up the latter of “success”. But my job won’t use any of this information. And yet it’ll still require it.

I hate this world sometimes. Why the fuck did we make it like this. I have so many things I try to look forward to in life and so many positive goals, but this whole system makes me fucking nihilistic.

My brothers received more attention than me, I remember when one day my older brother sold my bicycle that I had been given for Christmas to take his girlfriend to the movies, my older brother always hit me and my mother too.

In school my grades were never outstanding but I knew a lot, I just didn't like to do homework, in high school I went to a high school incorporated to the UAEMex but the teachers were against me and I had videos and tests, they ended up dropping me and my parents didn't help me after that my best friend who was of age enrolled me and paid a CBT and he became my tutor, I finished my high school and joined the ranks of the Mexican Air Force.

I was discharged in the parachute rifle brigade, a special corps of the SEDENA, I spent 3 years in the active duty, at that time I met the love of my life a beautiful girl she was 10 years older but she was a very centered and stable person, my time in the army was of ups and downs I had several confrontations with the c.o, I was diagnosed with post traumatic stress I decided to leave and go to the state police, I was diagnosed with post traumatic stress I decided to leave and go to the state police

,depression_help," so at my school there’s something called ‘the bonfire’ it’s just some stupid thing in the school parking lot where everyone’s goes to socialize. so i skipped going last year, because i really didn’t have much interest in going— but this year, i decided that i’d go and branch out, and go see how it is. 

i asked my friend to go with me, because we haven’t hung out in a while. we where both excited, and where happy to be able to talk and catch up— seeing is we have NO classes together. i was excited, im not one to really go to school events or hang out with people at all, but i was actually looking forward to seeing her and being able to be with her, because i love her. 

we got there and agreed MUTUALLY that it would be an US thing that night— we’d stop and say hi to people, but we’d stick together to talk and just be us. 

but we met up and said hi to her friends and all the sudden i’m the background character again. i walked behind them, i stood behind them. every time i tired to talk it’s like no one heard me and they contended with their inside jokes that i didn’t understand. they where all caught in in looking for cute boys, when all i wanted to do was talk to my best friend. 

it was just a moment when i was looking at the first and just had an ache in my whole body. i just felt so disappointed that i had gone out of my way and comfort zone to ask her to go to stupid fucking school event and i’m completely hazed. 

she only walked be halfway to my dads car, when she turned around with out other mutual friend and i just silently cried the whole way home.

,depression_help,"I moved back in with my parents after graduating from college and I absolutely hate it. They constantly leave me out of things, tell me all my problems are because of me, leave me behind constantly, and don’t help me financially. 

I have to pay for my own phone bill and groceries but the remote job I had from uni only paid me $9.50/hr. They tell me it’s my responsibility to budget for things but it’s extremely hard to do that working part in today’s economy. I have to constantly ask if I can have some of their food if they bought it.

They also go out to eat without me all the time. If I do come along with them I have to pay for my own meal most of the time. They don’t bother to ask if I would like to go. They’ll say stuff like they’re going to the store and then come back with to go boxes from a nice restaurant or icecream cups. They do this every week. I understand I’m living in their household rent free and they’re not entitled to bring me along on their outings but it would be nice if every once in a while if we all went out to eat together like we used to when I was a kid. 

Also they left at home on my birthday because I wasn’t ready on time. We didn’t have any reservations and the restaurant was down the street and didn’t open until 5pm. Even if we don’t have to be anywhere at a certain time they will leave me if I’m just a few minutes behind. I feel like it’s overkill if there are no appointments or time constraints. I can’t be one minute late, no exceptions. I had to Uber myself to eat dinner with them on my birthday. I tried to tell them that I was hurt by what they did and they said that me not being ready on time hurt their feelings and made them mad and made them feel like I didn’t want to spend time with them. 

I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs and they say it’s my fault I didn’t graduate with one lined up and not the current job market. They say I’m not trying hard enough when I apply to about 20-50 jobs per week. I told them I hate where I’m at in life and feel behind and my dad said it was my fault I didn’t apply to a bunch of jobs during my last semester. I was just trying to graduate and make sure I passed all my classes.

Ever since moving back in I’ve become severely depressed and being alive takes up a lot of my energy. I know I’m an adult but they won’t help me much. They won’t even let me practice driving unless it’s early Saturday morning before 9am. I’ve had my license for two years and it took me several to get it. 

Once I move out I plan on barely talking to them and keeping a good amount of distance. I don’t plan on inviting them to my birthday dinners or celebrations. I just want to move out and avoid them. Their treatment doesn’t teach me anything about the real world or how to be an adult, it just made me hate them and want to disappear from their lives.

It went downhill since highschool tho. I feel like all the things i do to make my mother proud are never enough, and sometimes it even ended up with me getting scolded and antagonized by her. Even when i became suicidal and sh, in the end all she did was threatened me

When i finally in college, everything feel like hell and i ended up losing all my motivation to even do anything at all. I barely met or talk to anyone and just.. Spent my time playing games. I couldn't bring myself to go to my campus. I fucking up my college life and i know that and everyday i scold myself for that and yet i still cant. Am i just lazy? How do i overcome this feelings.

I've actually been to a therapist before and drink meds,i did got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Although i never felt like it fully helps bc i was so nervous to tell them about myself and all the incredibly self sabotaging action i do.

I used to be a top students at High School and a student who always trying to achieve something in competition and pleasing other ppl. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It went downhill since highschool tho. I feel like all the things i do to make my mother proud are never enough, and sometimes it even ended up with me getting scolded and antagonized by her. Even when i became suicidal and sh, in the end all she did was threatened me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When i finally in college, everything feel like hell and i ended up losing all my motivation to even do anything at all. I barely met or talk to anyone and just.. Spent my time playing games. I couldn&amp;#39;t bring myself to go to my campus. I fucking up my college life and i know that and everyday i scold myself for that and yet i still cant. Am i just lazy? How do i overcome this feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve actually been to a therapist before and drink meds,i did got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Although i never felt like it fully helps bc i was so nervous to tell them about myself and all the incredibly self sabotaging action i do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should i seek more professional help? Am i actually ill or is everything is just made up in my head and that im just a stupid piece of shit to have lived. &lt;/p&gt;

This started in my teens, during my characteristic apathetic depressive epsiode, I wouldn’t move from the bed for several days, let alone brush my teeth. I wouldn’t drink water, or barely eat anything in such periods. I would sleep too much, too little, or at odd times, and would never go out of my room.

This led me to have gum problems, anal fissures and haemorrhoids, and a neck strain in my early 20s. These physical issues recur when I’m going through a depressive episode.

,depression_help,"I can't even fucking sleep after thinking through all this.
  At least two years ago I had people to be with at University, work-friends that I at least knew and went through difficulties with, but they're all gone now.  They've moved on, and I'm still there.  I haven't even gotten a fucking degree, I'm going for a certificate because I can't even handle more than three classes per semester because I can't organize for shit, ADHD has my memory all fucked, and I don't have anybody with me. It's always pushing people away because you know that you are unstable, and the thought of someone hurting you is even worse than being alone: it's a viscious cycle of loneliness, finding comfort, and then pushing it all away.

  I thought that once I finished school, I could finally get out, but it's the same.  There's nothing, just the same feeling of isolation, putting in application after fucking application for months, knowing that you have almost nothing to provide that an employer would be interested in.  WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT A LIBERAL ARTS DEGREE WAS A GOOD FUCKING IDEA TO STUDY FOR IN THE MIDDLE OF SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA!

  Then there's my family: an overworked mother with severe arthritis who micromanages an entire household because we all have ADH-fucking-D, a father who has dementia and is losing a bit of himself every year, a sister who is a 38-year-old depressed, unemployed, medically-obese train wreck with little to no motivation about anything except prattle on about internet trivia at dinner when nobody fucking asks, and then there's me.  I have to get my driving license to actually work in this city, and the only two people who can supervise me is my dad with a fucked up memory, and my sister who sleeps in till 4 in the afternoon, and who I'd rather put a nail through my brain than deal with her for more than 30 minutes!

  At least two years ago I had people to be with at University, work-friends that I at least knew and went through difficulties with, but they&amp;#39;re all gone now.  They&amp;#39;ve moved on, and I&amp;#39;m still there.  I haven&amp;#39;t even gotten a fucking degree, I&amp;#39;m going for a certificate because I can&amp;#39;t even handle more than three classes per semester because I can&amp;#39;t organize for shit, ADHD has my memory all fucked, and I don&amp;#39;t have anybody with me. It&amp;#39;s always pushing people away because you know that you are unstable, and the thought of someone hurting you is even worse than being alone: it&amp;#39;s a viscious cycle of loneliness, finding comfort, and then pushing it all away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that once I finished school, I could finally get out, but it&amp;#39;s the same.  There&amp;#39;s nothing, just the same feeling of isolation, putting in application after fucking application for months, knowing that you have almost nothing to provide that an employer would be interested in.  WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT A LIBERAL ARTS DEGREE WAS A GOOD FUCKING IDEA TO STUDY FOR IN THE MIDDLE OF SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s my family: an overworked mother with severe arthritis who micromanages an entire household because we all have ADH-fucking-D, a father who has dementia and is losing a bit of himself every year, a sister who is a 38-year-old depressed, unemployed, medically-obese train wreck with little to no motivation about anything except prattle on about internet trivia at dinner when nobody fucking asks, and then there&amp;#39;s me.  I have to get my driving license to actually work in this city, and the only two people who can supervise me is my dad with a fucked up memory, and my sister who sleeps in till 4 in the afternoon, and who I&amp;#39;d rather put a nail through my brain than deal with her for more than 30 minutes!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even feel satisfied about writing this shit because I know there are people that 30 times worse-off than me, and I&amp;#39;m just whining when I should be sleeping.

,depression_help,"I’ve never spoken about this openly before, but I can’t carry this weight in silence any longer. For the past four years, I was trapped in a relationship that broke me in ways I never imagined. I gave everything I had—my heart, my soul, my time, my energy. I cared for someone through their worst moments, through their struggles, thinking that this is what love is supposed to be. But in return? I was met with nothing but mental and emotional torture.



Every single day felt like a battle, a battle I never asked for but had to endure. I was manipulated, gaslighted, made to believe I was the problem—constantly told I wasn’t good enough, that I wasn’t worth anything. I fought to keep that person standing, while they silently tore me apart piece by piece. They drained me of everything I had, until there was nothing left inside of me but emptiness.



And then, when I was at my lowest, when I thought things couldn’t possibly get worse, they threw me away. Just like that. They cheated, and I was discarded as if I meant nothing—like all the sacrifices, all the love, and all the care I gave meant absolutely nothing. It felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest and stomped on. They left me shattered.



Now I live with the aftermath. Every night is a new nightmare. I wake up in cold sweats, reliving every moment of abuse, every word that was used to break me, every look of disdain that told me I wasn’t worth loving. I can’t escape it. The memories of the pain haunt me even when I close my eyes. I feel trapped in a never-ending loop of trauma, and I can’t seem to break free.



People tell you time heals all wounds, but what do you do when the wounds keep getting torn open? When the person who destroyed you walks away without a scratch, while you’re left bleeding internally? I don’t know how to heal from this. I don’t know how to stop the nightmares, how to stop the panic attacks, how to stop the constant ache in my chest. 



I just want to feel normal again, to breathe without this heavy darkness sitting on my shoulders. But right now, it feels impossible. I feel like I’m drowning, and no one even knows how deep the water goes.



If anyone has been through something like this, please tell me... how do you survive this? How do you rebuild yourself when someone you loved tore you apart?

,depression_help,"I have been off work this past week due to severe depression and anxiety.

I am not sure what caused it, depression progressively got worse, started missing hobbies and things I enjoy, only managing to work and no more, not looking after myself properly, over a few weeks and eventually could not manage to go to work any more.

I have been off with depression for one week and have mostly been in bed. This is the worst my mental health has been since 2021 when I was really unwell. I feel frustrated that I'm unwell again. I feel guilty for being like this.

I am working on cleaning up my room which I'm just doing a little at a time. It was like a hoarding situation and I am making progress with this for the first time in a long time. 

I'm going through a medication change which I hope will help.

I need to go for a shower. I've not had a shower for a week. My head is itchy. I smell terrible. I am embarrassed to tell anyone. I feel ashamed. I know it seems stupid like why don't I just go for a shower but I just can't face it.

I've only really been eating peanut butter sandwiches.

Is this normal for someone who is depressed? What would help? When would be a good time to go for a shower? It seems silly to go for a shower and then clean my room because I will get sweaty while cleaning? 

I want to to go back to work but I feel that I'm probably not well and should maybe take another week off. I'm really keen to be back at work. I want to be well and happy and working, not alone at home having anxiety attacks etc but I cannot help this.

This is unusual I am usually very clean and shower every day or 2.

I am 21 years old. I passed Highschool with an Adult Diploma by the skin of my teeth. I have never had a job.

Nor did I have any classes that I had excelled at. Even my hobbies, like games, writing, and art, I have no skills in.

I never practice anything, and when I try, my brain starts to hurt so much that I start crying. I have a mental breakdown from trying to practice tying my shoes, something I can't do properly.

It seems like each year around her birthday she goes into a spiral of off the wall/bad decisions and she&amp;#39;s been giving up more and more each year as well. She has 2 daughters, 15y/o and 6y/o, and due to her giving up they unfortunately suffer a sort of absence of the only parent they actually have in their lives. My husband and I have been filling the gaps for her for years, so much so that we became more of the parents than my sister to her own children. I&amp;#39;m not sure what to do to try to help her be more involved and do what she needs and is suppose to be doing as a mother. It&amp;#39;s not that she isn&amp;#39;t there at all, they live with her and she works, but other than providing for them financially she isn&amp;#39;t present and doesn&amp;#39;t parent them as she should. I know it&amp;#39;s due to her still being heartbroken over losing her person years ago but I&amp;#39;m not sure how to help her out of it so she can heal and become the person she herself has said she wants to be. Any advice? &lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Hey guys, I just really need to get this off my chest. I’m 17 (F) from Asia, and honestly, I feel completely lost. I have no clear goals in life except one: to be rich. That’s it. I know it sounds shallow, but I just want to live a good life, be financially secure, and have lasting friendships. But here’s the thing—I have no clue where to start.

Where I live, opportunities are limited, and I come from a low-income family. I’ve thought about studying abroad, but I'm an average student, and I don’t think I’d get into a good college overseas. Plus, being from a poor family, I don’t have the financial resources to make it happen. I don’t even know what field I want to study, and with college coming up next year, it’s stressing me out so much.

I’ve thought about STEM, but I don’t have any real interest in it, and the competition is intense. Plus, I'm not confident in my skills in that area, and I’m worried I’d just end up hating it. I’ve also considered finance, but I don’t know much about it, and it feels like a huge risk if I end up not liking it.

Honestly, I feel like my life is just crumbling. I have no hobbies, no passion, no direction. I’ve never had friends growing up, and I struggle with extreme social anxiety, so I’ve never really connected with anyone, even online. I’ve never even talked to a foreigner before (by foreigner, I mean anyone from a different country) ,texted but never talked on voice chat becuase i am scared to talk people outside my lang/culture , and that scares me. I don’t know how they’ll perceive me, especially since I’m a person of color. My English is okay, but I’m not great at speaking it, and I feel like I’m at a disadvantage.

It’s also hard to imagine moving to another country. I want to settle outside of my country .I’d need a visa, and getting a job that sponsors a visa seems nearly impossible, especially since I’m just average and the job market is tough right now. So even if I did want to move abroad, I’m not sure how to go about it.

I’m scared of regretting the next few years of my life. I just want to make sure I don’t mess up and end up stuck in a life I don’t want. I really just want two things: to have some real friends and to get rich. But I’m so confused about how to get there.

I am willing to improve and change but i dont know where to start ,i am so lost, just tell me advices and tips on how to get out of this situation becuase if i dont start now , i dont think i ever will

Kill myself in some easy, quick, painless way? A cold, quiet death, and then blissful nothingness? It sounds about a thousand times better than spending the next 60 years struggling and fighting so goddamn hard to stay in a life that I extract exactly zero benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm at one of my lowest points again, and I really want to know if this is normal. Does this happen to other people too? It's starting to worry me. I'm really hard on myself, I know that. I always want to be miles ahead of my rivals first, then everyone else. Things didn’t work out because it broke me once when I stagnated. But still, I know I'm better than many. I've been through depression and chronic anxiety for almost three years because of my studies and the tough education system in my country, and also because of myself. I managed to push through, and now I'm at a relatively good college, though surrounded by bad people, except for a very small amount of good ones. But out of nowhere, I just snapped and broke down. I’m currently looking for an internship, which isn’t such a big deal, maybe just a little stressful, but nothing major. But I feel like even the smallest obstacle shakes me to the core, both physically and emotionally.

I feel so sad and angry. Strangers asked if I'm okay -closest didnt- and I tell them yaa I’m fine, but I’m really not. That’s not the real issue though. My chest hurts, and all I can do is sleep. I feel like I'm falling behind while everyone else is doing fine. Even on normal days, I don’t feel okay. I always want to be better, but I think my mental health has weakened because of everything I’ve beenand got through. During these phases, I tend to ghost everyone. I don’t really have friends I can open up to because I have trust issues. It feels weird after I try to talk about it, and I don’t want empathy from anyone—I don't need it...and last thing I need is ppl telling me im just dramatic and delusional ..

Also, I haven’t cried in more than 6 or 7 years, which sounds strange, but it’s true. Lately, I’ve been having really dark thoughts, imagining bad things happening to my family, and I don’t know what that means. I also have weird dreams, like an eagle eating a cat that tried to eat a rat, and I’m forcing people to watch it, or parasites turning animals into zombies. It's not normal.

I used to self-harm maybe 4 or 5 times in my life thats why I self-diagnosed my self with DID.. but I’ve been clean for the past 3-4 months. So much is happening, and I don’t know what to do. I went for a walk today and video-called my family since I haven’t seen them in months. I’m really scared, both for myself and of myself.

I've been through depression, yep extreme one and borow anti-depressant from a friend once, but what feels now is worse is that even though I got out of that depression two years ago, I don’t know if the physical damage in my brain is still there. It’s sad that the slightest feeling of being down makes my brain flood with cortisol and stops all the serotonin, or whatever it is. How can the smallest thing bring out the worst in me? I know life is a sinusoidal function, and I feel like a building about to break, but I don’t think I’m truly broken yet.

,depression_help,"I was suppose to get married in January and my life was going to be set from there. I met  my fiancé when he was in the U.S. on a student visa and sadly that visa expired and he had to go home. I feel like when that happened that was when my life turned and not for the better. I was in such a deep depression but I didn’t know it would get worse from there. 

He was suppose to come back on his renewed visa but that visa got denied. We worked with a lawyer who suggested the K1 fiancé visa and we applied for it. We thought it would go well and our time of being apart was over. But no because after his interview he didn’t get approved nor denied. It seems they need more information but we don’t know exactly what they need. The case status is just unknown and we’re working with our lawyer to figure this all out. Sadly there’s a chance he could be denied and with that I don’t know what to do. Either we apply for a marriage visa which will take 1-2 years. Basically I’ll marry him and then I come back without him. Or I’ll move to South Korea and have my life there with him. Both options I really don’t want to do like I don’t want to be without him any longer and I’m unsure about moving there. My mom is making me feel horrible about moving there.

I’m in such horrible condition. All I do is sleep, cry, I’ve been drinking whenever I can and it’s gotten so bad that I vomited, my psychiatrist increased my dosage of my anti depressants, and I’ve been hurting myself. I don’t even know how I can begin to tell my fiancé any of this. I’m so scared he will blame himself. I know it probably sounds like I’m too codependent but imagine being away from your loved once since a year and you have no idea what the future holds for you. I want him to be here so much and I want the future I painted in my mind. I was so close to having everything I wanted but it feels so far away now. I even miss the nostalgia of our past that we had when he was here. I forgot what it’s like to be with him. I only know what it’s like as a short reminder when I see him on my vacation time just for that to end because I have to come home.

Going to therapy and increasing my anti depressants aren’t working. If this doesn’t work out with the K1 visa do I just marry him and come back alone or move there? I feel like everyone wants me to stay here and not move there. It’s like for my mom she’ll say “oh stay in the U.S. because you have family and just wait for him”. No one is taking into account my pain and suffering. I don’t even know what’s best for me anymore. Everyday has turned into a continuation of the days I have been living without him. Everyone’s lives are going forward while mine is trapped. I can’t talk to my fiancé anymore without feeling a wave of depression and even my fiancé pointed out that I sound depressed when talking to him. I try to tell him it’s not him but me.

Long story short - I’ve been burned out for years, I get anxious frequently or suffer sometimes from my own anger that I keep all in, but overall, I consider myself not depressed. Then this year hit with a tumor diagnosis, rude doctors, layoffs, financial insecurity, and I started taking Lexapro for anxiety, but it made me feel so bad that I had to stop. I’ve got Trittico for sleeping and I’ve got orthostatic low blood pressure and since I have hormonal issues so I’ve got Bromocriptin, so under 1,5 months I’ve got an SSRI, and SNRI and a dopamine agonist and it was really not helping my mental health all these switches but especially Lexapro. I am certain that noradrenaline and dopamin is the way for me but with all the hormonal issues and taking 15 pills a day I am hesitant to try new pills, especially after Lexapro.

I’m on sick leave, my GP is pushing me to go back to work even though I have a valid specialist’s recommendation. Supposedly, my company is waiting for me and I’m promised a new, higher-level position, but so far, it’s just empty promises, and I still feel terrible about going back to this company. I’m not usually a depressive type or I’m high functioning. I don’t feel sad most of the time, I have a will to live and I don’t want to hurt myself, the only place where I can’t excel in my life is tyding and cleaning my flat.

The reason why they disputed because he wanted to drive his car for an little tour it was around 10pm. But they didnt agreed because his was wasnt insured but he knew a spot where there isnt police at all. Then our step father bringed old issues like why our father doesnt pay it instead, etc. He raised his voice and my brother told him to not raise hiz voice calmly but he just kept raising his voice, after that my brother yelled with the top of his lungs, my step father came to him and shaked him they were almost going to have an fight but my mom separated them, then he started to cry silently sobbing. I dont understand, why he crys? I just need thoughts of other peoples mind. My brother always smiles and laughs to even cringes things either outside, but at home he is.. normal, doesnt smile much or laugh but if we ask him how is he doing he let out an small giggle and says he is absolutely fine. Im kind of lost, he is weird. Please i need help guys. since then he always speak lowly, very calm and almost never speak. He got an tiktok and he always and his reposts are weird.

Thats the first time he yelled like that, afterwards  he sobbed. Real hard and excused himself like 10 times if not more. The reason why they disputed because he wanted to drive his car for an little tour it was around 10pm. But they didnt agreed because his was wasnt insured but he knew a spot where there isnt police at all. Then our step father bringed old issues like why our father doesnt pay it instead, etc. He raised his voice and my brother told him to not raise hiz voice calmly but he just kept raising his voice, after that my brother yelled with the top of his lungs, my step father came to him and shaked him they were almost going to have an fight but my mom separated them, then he started to cry silently sobbing. I dont understand, why he crys? I just need thoughts of other peoples mind. My brother always smiles and laughs to even cringes things either outside, but at home he is.. normal, doesnt smile much or laugh but if we ask him how is he doing he let out an small giggle and says he is absolutely fine. Im kind of lost, he is weird. Please i need help guys. since then he always speak lowly, very calm and almost never speak. He got an tiktok and he always and his reposts are weird. Things of depression but when i ask him why he reposts them he just say &amp;quot;oh its nothing its because im bored&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"So it’s SAD season and I’ve been looking at different ways to cope and face these next couple months prepared. I’m on vit D, regularly exercise, I’ve put myself on a good schedule as far as work/school/personal, I’ve got a budget, and my personal hygiene had been spot on up until 3 days ago when I hit a  rough patch and have been bed rotting and doom scrolling  for the last 3 days.

Here is the down low: I’m behind in (2 classes) school due to procrastinating, I’m on my period, broke as hell until next week, my car is parked and won’t be able to afford fixing it until November and  as of recently was yelled at in front of my coworkers by my new supervisor (he’s been my supervisor for less than 2 weeks, it was very embarrassing). All these things mixed together and the cold weather has left me feeling fatigued, anxious, uncomfortable and just having a general disinterest in life rn. I have a limited support system my family and I are not close and all my friends live out of state and also we aren’t as close as we use to be but they do know I go through SAD.

I want to jump start myself so I can get back to my regular routine. September was a really good month for me and when I look back my situation was even more dire yet I still have the motivation and ambition to keep on going. 

So my question is if you go through seasonal depression: how do you get out of those funks? How do you express your feelings when you don’t really have an outlet? And lastly what are some things you do to keep SAD from keeping you down?

So i told him before i had an abortion te situation that why am i pregnant etc.. he said he took off the condom and he will take care of me etc etc.. so i decided to do abortion and told him about it.. i mostly did it because i felt violated and that he wanted to make a life decision for me without my concent meanwhile i was a scholarship student and was 17yeaes younger than him. So basically my was a scholarship student.. also he was married which he lied to me. Another thing that made me make that conclusion is because at one point. He literally told me.

So after the abortion we parted ways because i didn’t want anything to do with him.. he doesn’t consider me as his equal and other mental control he was doing to me.
So years passed by and he met me.. but he told me he hated me and he will never forgive me for what i did. Meanwhile i feel he abused me and violated me.. trying to baby trap me..

so i haven’t been diagnosed with anything, and i’ve never been to a therapist or a doctor, just to be clear. i’ve had this conversation with my parents before, when they found some texts about me questioning my life— and it was just the worst thing that has ever happened to me and i never want to have that conversation with my parents again. and i still didn’t get any help after that. 

so just to explain a bit— i’ve just been feeling empty. i’m not particularly sad, but i’m also not very happy either. nothing brings me real enjoyment anymore. i don’t have anything to look forward to, im not excited to do anything anymore. i’ve lost interest in everything ive ever loved. i’ve grown to hate the presence of my friends, they’re draining and i feel like i can’t breathe when im around them. i just want to be left alone ALL THE TIME. i just want to be alone everyday all day. i have no interest in hobbies, or going out with my friends, or having a boyfriend, or honestly, having friends at all. i already barley talk to them. 

i just want to know how to fix this because i see all the girls my age, and im just so different. i don’t go out, or make new friends or try new things, because im not interested. please help me

,depression_help,"I've been taking anti-depressants for years, have been speaking to a therapist for the past two years, have been making changes in my life, and have had multiple blood tests that are all in line. I also exercise 4 times a week.  

I've had feelings of depression for the past 20ish years, and my biggest symptom that hasn't significantly improved is my energy levels. 

It's very frustrating because I want to be more productive and make changes in my life, but I'm so tired all the time. 

Drinking coffee helps but it's just a bandaid.

I don't even know what's causing it.  My current theory is that holding onto anger towards my dad is ""weighing"" me down, but I haven't resolved that yet.

,depression_help,"I (23F) Got a job two months ago after going through a cyber course and working before during and after it. But this job is the first one I felt I got for being me, not just my knowledge, which made me quite happy.

Even though it is an hour each way (ATLEAST) with public transportation, it does not bother me too much.

I get along with everyone, I am friendly, I help everyone and anyone (Even if it not my job, though my job does relate to support). I have more than a few work friends, I am happy with work over all but...

But I feel like I have to maintain it, and then I was advised by family members to not push it (I used to push it too far, but with help and support from professionals have learnt how to not do so. Learned how to avoid doing so BEFORE the new job) But then was told stopping by in their office (Each team or part of a team got a different office/room) once a day ruins productivity for them, or is just not normal, even though we do not talk for more than 10 minutes and it is usually less than an hour after everyone come in or a little before lunch (I do not eat lunch with the same people everyday, so most days I talk to those I know I will not eat lunch with that day.)

I live with my parents, in my country it is quite normal. I am the first born and the only one who live with my parents, as my brothers each got their programs they go to which living accommodations. When it is just my parents I get along with them quite fine, it is even nice sometimes to come home to them already being home and sit down and have a relaxed evening together.

But when my brothers come back home during the weekend/holidays, I just want to stay in my room the entire time.

They are mean, each in their own way, both very judgmental, competitive, arrogant, and many other things I am sure you can think of that relates or connects to anything I wrote above, and before you ask ""What makes you think you are not?"" Well, I am not arrogant, I admit my mistakes, willing to learn and am not competitive with people unless we agreed its a competition.

My brothers are mean to me, bully mean, takes their jokes on/with me too far and are just overall mean, judge me for the way I do things and get upset when it is not how they would do it. My parents claim to back me up but they really just tell my brothers it was not right and that is it, other than that they do not support me when it comes to them unleashing hell on me. (It is their house so I feel like they have more power than they give themselves.)

The other one is a girl who I have been friends with since Highschool, and we stayed in contact this entire time, but meeting up with her is even harder as she is very busy and our times do not align too well.

,depression_help,"Hello… I am one week shy of being 25 and…. Let me tell you my story. 

I have 3 dogs, a toddler and a 4 year relationship with a man I love. The only important things I have left in my life. 

I want to end it all… I don’t want help. I don’t want a number to call or text, just want to die. 

I want this world to suffer, without me. Like I’ve had to do for years. 

I lost my dad around a month after my son was born. I lost my best friend… my support system… to alcohol. He drank himself to death.. 

My mother… well she’s on the same path to killing herself. She won’t stop drinking, even though she watched her husband die from it, and forced her then 22 year old.. who had her own kid to take care of… made her care for her father in the last month of his life. 
While said daughter has, heart failure.. and diabetes. Mother knows this… and has told the daughter to her face… “if you didn’t have your kid I wouldn’t help.” She never wanted me. She’s made that clear since I was 11. She made it clear I’m such a burden to her… 

We can’t even afford our bills when working 40-80 hours a week. We can’t afford living anymore… I have a fucking toddler who I feel like I’m failing everyday. 

My 25th is in one week, and I have never felt this depressed before. 
Can’t afford to go out. My mother asked me even if she could skip my birthday celebration, bc she doesn’t want to see me. She asked if my son was going to be there, and I said “most likely his dad will be working so I’ll have him” and she scoffed at me. Said to me over the phone “well I don’t give a fuck about you guys. I wanna see my guy. I want to see my grandson.” Like ma’am. I am your daughter…. He wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for me. 

I don’t feel okay anymore. I don’t want to live anymore. I don’t want my baby to ever feel this pain… so what do I do? How do I cope? How do I… make my mother love me again and stop drinking? 

Killing my self. Ending it all… would solve 99.9% of my problems.


Why can’t I commit to it? Why can’t I just fucking get my head out my ass and do it? 

What am I scared of? I’ll be dead any way. 
Maybe… it’s the thought of failing my son? Maybe it’s.. something else. 

I did get into consoling about 2-3 years ago when my dad passed to help.. it doesn’t help now. It doesn’t do anything for me. 

How do I feel okay again? How do…. I make myself not sad? Not depressed? How am I supposed to live, if I can’t even wake up and feel okay? 


So what is the point of living? What is the point of trying to continue my life, when we won’t succeed. We won’t make our rent next month, we won’t make anything next month. 
We won’t survive. My son is better off with someone else. My life is better off dead.

Title says it all really. I’m 23f and have been struggling w undiagnosed depression for maybe around 8 years now.

So long story short , my best friend (22f) was diagnosed with severe depression for about 3 years ago , and lately things are getting way out of hand , I can't say much about her circumstances other than that she went through some major batsh't , and believe me when I tell u she hadn't gotten it any easy and I'm not being dramatic nor anything.
 
And now what I'm asking is if anyone can give me any tips, pieces of advice ,anything please anything i can do to help her , I'm afraid she gonna do something to herself 
Is there anything i can do to help her ,and please bear in mind that I'm in a different city than her ,about 8.30 hrs away , please tell me how can I help her please 

Ps: she feels like she's empty , everything that she went through since she was 5 has drained her and took the best of her ,now she's just an empty vessel,she has no ambitions , dreams ,a reason to live , nothing 
She's merely existing that's it

I’m a 38 year old male, married with two children under 5. I make decent money, own a home and can afford some luxuries. Overall, I’d say I’m doing really well in my life. It’s one that I worked really hard for despite a terrible childhood of sexual abuse at the hands of a family member, a broken family, alcoholic parents, moving from home to home every 6-12 months due to evictions, not having food to eat and being neglected then actually orphaned in my early teens. Once I was old enough, I joined the military and served 4 years, got out and used the GI Bill for school and got married too young. It wasn’t a great marriage by any stretch but she ended up cheating and we divorced. A few years later I remarried and now have a great wife. I have a great job where I make a six figure salary. I would think I should be happy and like to think generally I have been happy despite everything. I have a life most would love on the surface.

I'm the youngest of eight in my family, and I’m feeling completely overwhelmed. After my grandparents passed away, our family dynamic changed dramatically. We used to live in a stable home, but now it’s filled with conflict and chaos.

Many of my relatives are struggling with substance abuse, creating a toxic environment. My room is right next to where they use drugs, and it’s unbearable. Despite working hard to contribute, I feel like I’m the only one trying to make a difference while my family is actively against me.

They recently sold our house and now have money, but they refuse to support me in any way. I’m desperate to escape this situation and start anew in Thailand. All I’m asking for is help with a ticket and a month’s rent.

I feel so isolated, and it seems like everyone is against me. What should I do right now? I’m reaching out for advice and support, as I just want the chance to build a better life for myself. Please, if anyone can help or offer guidance, I would be so grateful.

,depression_help,"(Tagged nsfw for talking about suicidal thoughts)

I'm having a bad depressive episode and i'm scared that my suicidal thoughts are starting to become intentions. Last night i spent half an hour sat on a window ledge.

,depression_help,"I don't t want to do anything, and I'm not sure if I'm eligible to call myself depressed. I feel overwhelming laziness. I self-sabotage at work by doing nothing and then lie about it. I feel like I've never done anything in my life by my own choice. It feels like life drags me along, and I don't put in any effort. Sometimes I try exercising or putting effort into work, but it doesn't last long.

My partner is disappointed in me. I don't even want the relationship because I don't want to put in the effort or make promises to change. I've always failed those promises to myself, so how can I keep them to someone else? Everyone around me says that I blame others, that I act like a victim, blaming my childhood, lack of support, and so on. My parents say the same, and they're probably right.

I'm going to a therapist, but I've grown tired of her. We keep discussing my emotions, but I don't take action. I always feel like if I just put in more effort, everything will be alright. But when I try, nothing changes immediately, and I fall back into the same laziness. I've been like this for at least the last six years (I'm 26 now). I keep finding distractions, but underneath, it's always the same - this unwillingness to do anything with myself.

I'm going to see a psychiatrist today, not because my therapist referred me, but out of curiosity. Maybe I want to hear whether I need to ""get my act together,"" or if I need other means of support like medication. Or maybe I'm just looking for another easy solution.

I do think of suicide sometimes, but I'm too afraid to die because I don't want to feel pain,not because I care about my family or partner. In fact, I dont  think I care about them at all. It also seems like my relationship is ending. It's sad and inconvenient, but I don't feel like saving it.

So, am I just lazy and need to put in more effort? Or is there something else going on? Am I looking for a diagnosis? In both cases, it feels like I'll need to put in a lot of effort to do anything about it.

Hi all, 34NB. 

I don’t know where to start, I’m in freeze right now and trying to work my way out of it. I wanted to share my experiences and seek some advice.

I have been making progress in therapy/life over the past 6 years since I but I feel I have regressed since May and after completing my PhD. I think I’m looking too much at the pain and dwelling in my own suffering. The following have happened since May:

- My roommate at best friend for 8 years moved across the country. She was the first person I learned to trust fully and is a major support.
- My neighbor, whom I had a casual sexual relationship with, seemed to have a psychotic break. He accused me of breaking in a stealing his wallet, and then tried to attack another person in our building who he thought was my partner. Making my living situation feel horrendous and unsafe
- I went no contact with my family after sharing my csa by my father from 6-10. They didn’t believe me and sided with my father. My father is an alcoholic and drank even after receiving a liver transplant in 2021.

All of these situations feel overwhelming and I find myself in a deep depression. I’m currently staying with friends and looking for a new apartment. I’ve had to take so much time off of work and I had to take the day off and it’s considered leave without pay. I’m good at my job and they have assured me it’s okay, but I’m still so worried. I work as a psychologist in an inpatient setting. Previously the work has been so powerful but because of the following events that occurred on another unit, I’m losing steam:

- A patient was suffering so severely from hallucinations that they tore their eyes out.
- A patient, while on an outing with her family, escaped and committed suicide. 
- A staff member kicked a patient in the head, requiring staples.

It’s a state hospital and the system is broken. 

I feel like my internal system is breaking down.

I have been so lucky with great friends, my psychologist, and my psychiatrist. I feel afraid that because of my struggle I’m disappointing them. I’m struggling to stay away from alcohol and just want to escape.

When I try to notice and feel the hopefulness, one of my others in my internal system doesn’t believe it’s real. That I will continue to suffer and that I deserve it. 

Any words of wisdom to hold onto is welcome.

,depression_help,"Been struggling with depression for a long time. It has gotten a little bit better over the last few months. But my motivation just isn't returning to normal levels.

I'm currently unemployed, so theoretically I have a LOT of free time to chase my dreams and whatnot. This situation obviously can't last forever. So as I see it, I have a unique opportunity to do things like write, mod, make Youtube videos, etc. to attempt to create a living for myself that I might actually enjoy.

But there's a problem... Namely that I find it very hard to do anything. I find it hard to motivate myself to do much more than sit here, post on social media and watch videos. Aside from doing basic household tasks like cooking, cleaning, etc. Sometimes I'll have just about enough motivation to work a little bit on my book or play a video games. I enjoy both and yet I still find it hard to get myself to do either of them.

So, I'm wondering, is there anything that has helped any of you get your motivation back?

,depression_help,"I am 6 months postpartum. I had 3 months of maternity leave and went through the normal hormonal ups and downs and it got very hard there at the end. I am lucky enough to work from home full-time so returning to work, I get to keep my baby home with me. 

Going back to work actually felt like it was helping me feel better. At work I am so needed and appreciated. I even came back and was offered a promotion with a fairly good pay increase.

I am now 3 months into working a full-time, 40hr+ a week job and keeping the baby with me 24/7 on top of keeping up with being a wife and homemaker. I don’t do anything halfway and feel the need to do everything as close to perfect as I can get. This has caused me to work so hard at everything and I’m starting to experience burn out. I am realizing going back to work didn’t make me less depressed but rather have me an excuse to ignore my problems. I would work late nights and any overtime I could get trying to avoid my “real life”.

Now being burnt out and all that depression flooding back, I have been thinking about dying every day. How much easier it would be. Not suicidal, I don’t have any plans nor see myself going through with it. I really just don’t see any other end to this suffering. I don’t see any solutions that could make me feel better or help me. My husbands asks how he can help and all I can tell him is “I don’t know”. 

All this to say, I fear I am approaching a very dangerous part of depression and need to seek help. I have a very hard time asking for help or talking about my feelings. I don’t have any friends and my family all has their own stuff going on. My husband does not understand depression or mental health as that is just how he grew up and that’s ok. I don’t have a primary care physician and have never liked any that I’ve seen. I live in the middle of nowhere, so no clue where to find a psychiatrist and I don’t benefit from the online psychiatry sites as I don’t feel it’s the same as in person help.

Where do I go to start? Or how can I get help? I don’t know if this is PPD or just plain old depression but I am really getting desperate at this point.

I'm 42. I worked at a store for almost 16 years, then disagreements with COVID caused me to lose that job.

Then after that I attempted a few side hustles to which they're not successful. One I'm trying now is speed dating and even that is not successful despite me registering my business with the government.

I went to school and now I feel that's a waste because I'm not working in my field.

I'm never able to save money (right now I'm in debt). I managed to take a couple of vacations before (not overseas), but now, I can't really afford local bus fare.

I am not asking for money.

I am asking for help in turning my life around because I feel that very soon I'm going to end up living on the street through no fault of my own. :( Despite living with family, the only things they seem to support me in is housing and food but in terms of my business goals, they won't support me at all :(

,depression_help,"Hi Everyone,

I’m writing to reach out for help with fighting depression. I’ve been dealing with frequent thoughts of suicide and depressed moods for well over a year now, and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder by a psychiatrist. I’m 4 months into taking medication, which has helped, but I’m still very depressed (continuing to have frequent thoughts of suicide, happy moods aren’t stable, etc). Although I’m doing my best to hang in there, I’ve been dealing with depression for the entirety of my adult life, and it’s becoming harder to keep going when I’ve felt so intensely bad for so long. 

Basically I’m not sure what more I can do. I’m exercising, I’m eating ok, I sleep well, I sought help and have medication. But I remain in a very unhealthy place mentally. I don’t have any plan to commit suicide and don’t want to, which is good. I am still afraid of my conditioning worsening over time or reaching a point where i don’t want to go on if I’m still dealing with major depression over years.

Although I’m doing my best to hang in there, I’ve been dealing with depression for the entirety of my adult life, and it’s becoming harder to keep going when I’ve felt so intensely bad for so long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I’m not sure what more I can do. I’m exercising, I’m eating ok, I sleep well, I sought help and have medication. But I remain in a very unhealthy place mentally. I don’t have any plan to commit suicide and don’t want to, which is good. I am still afraid of my conditioning worsening over time or reaching a point where i don’t want to go on if I’m still dealing with major depression over years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else faced long term major depression like this and found a good way to manage it and get better? &lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Hello. I am writing this because I have no one to talk about this with.


7 months ago, i was broken up with after a 2 year relationship. I wanted and was clear about a future together and his change of my mind ultimately led to the breakup, but it doesn't matter. It's more so how he treated me in the process and his lack of accountability that absolutely tore me apart. 


7 months post-breakup and I still cry everyday. Let me explain, he was not invested in the relationship; didn't call, text, think of my birthday, introduce me to his family, include me, consider my feelings, my passions, and I'm starting to believe he didn't even find me pretty, etc. I will always remember how annoyed he was when I asked him the typical “when did you know you were in love” question. In retrospect, he did not care to connect with me. I in those 2 years of dating would communicate very clearly on what I wanted, maybe, a 100 times? His typical answer was he'd take care of me “once the semester was over”, or may I say, his typical lie, that I completely fell into because I really wanted us. Dismissal led to getting physical with him; I started poking and tapping his shoulders to “wake him up”, in a sense. It angered him so much. That's when the abuse started. He kicked me, bruised me, he would grab my wrists, he ripped my shirt. All because I just wanted his investment? What he did to me haunts me. He decided to break up with me when I was tightening the screw about my criteria; that is, being a present boyfriend.


In the process of the breakup, he admitted to basically lying to me for 2 years about his intentions. I feel utterly used for sex and for money, especially since I had been so transparent about settling down with him. He then blamed me by saying “why didn't you leave if i was such a bad boyfriend?”, maybe because I fell into your lies? He also said I idealized him as another way to defend his actions.


He refuses to apologize. My every attempt at a discussion with him is interpreted as a way to get him back. I think he is just so full of it… There's truthfully nothing to miss out on with him, except the love I got to give. 


His lack of accountability is what really destroys me. I have been having depressive episodes. There are moments where I cried so much I felt braindead. I was angry. I felt so alone and misunderstood. I felt taken advantage of. Violated. Used and discarded when inconvenient. It's tragic. 


When I told his parents of the abuse, as a desperate way to be heard and to grasp some form of justice, they all got mad at me, saying I'm disrespectful and that I'm a liar. His mom told me that his son was not an aggressor. She completely erased all my bruises and pain. Honestly, that made me suicidal. That was maybe 4 months ago.


I'm wondering how I can get over this. I'm wondering if people have also been in a similar situation. I love this person so much. Am i crazy ?

I wanted to share something that's been weighing on me. Today I missed an important appointment with my psychologist that I had been looking forward to. I thought it was scheduled for 11 AM, but it was actually at 8 AM. I didn't check the reminder in time, and I feel terrible about it. The next appointment is at November 3rd.

This was a significant opportunity for me to discuss some ongoing issues, and I can't shake the feeling that I've let myself down. I know it's just a mistake, but I keep replaying it in my mind and struggling to focus on anything else.

I called the Employee Assistance Program, and they helped me feel a bit better by reminding me that mistakes happen and I shouldn't be too hard on myself. They suggested I write down my feelings to process what happened.

I'm curious if anyone else has experienced something similar and how you coped with it. Any advice or support would be appreciated!

,depression_help,"Hi, I hope you are well. I'm 19 years old and currently not doing so well in life. I had to take a gap year and try to get better grades for uni and it's been exhausting.

The problem is my loved ones, like my parents, siblings and relatives tend to take a jab at me regarding this everytime they are mad at me. They can be loving and all, but if they get mad at me for something, theyll say ""all your friends have made it to uni and look where you are"" or call me a failure. At that time, I just normally listen to them because I don't have any defense and I just absorb all of it and tbh, it haunts me especially when I'm trying to sleep at night. I have issues sleeping, I hear all of these comments in my head.

So the issue is, since I absorb all this, I tend to lash out, verbally ofc after every few weeks since I'm completely full, so if someone does smth to irritate me, it all comes out at them even if they don't deserve it. It just happened again now and I feel bad. I'm tired of this, I don't really have anyone to vent out to, my gf has problems shes facing too and she overthinks and worries a lot and it can really affect her breathing, so I don't tell her what's in my head.

,depression_help,"I don't know what to do.

I've struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember, I've had support and social workers, counsellors and therapists for the best part of a decade.... I never wanted kids, the main reason being was my mental health - i didn't want to bring a child up in a world I found already found difficult to cope with... ironically I fell pregnant... and was talked out of an abortion; I was reminded how mentally and physically painful it would have been (I found out a fair few weeks into pregnancy so by the time I would have had it done it wouldn't have just been a pill and go situation), usually family ""supportive""blurb -we will help, you won't be on you're own, you can do this... Long story short, I've got a little girl and I adore the bones of her, she's been my sole reason to live over the last 5 years. But honestly I'd be lying if I didn't think of a way I could end my life, it's become stressful as I'm constantly in a state of fighting my demons and push through so I can give my little girl the best life I could possibly give her but I want nothing more than to have my forever sleep.

I stay on my bed for days on end, sometimes skipping meals in the process. Nothing motivates me to do anything. Showers became extremely difficult for me to do, I’d stay days without a shower. 

I tried everything and nothing worked for me. And I’m scared to increase Wellbutrin to 450 since the current dosage already gives me enough side effects.

,depression_help,"I am eating myself up from the inside
My state of mind is killing me, it feels like I am not living, but surviving mentally. Despite the fact that in reality everything is fine. My mental state is really not normal. It feels like at one point I will burn out and just commit suicide. But most likely my other self will remind me that everything is fine, and I have no right to complain about a good life, I have no right to end it, stupidly because of my personal reasoning.

I irritate myself. My thoughts are filled with what people think of me or what they thought. I compare myself to others, although I receive compliments in my direction. I do not know how to perceive any good statements addressed to me, I can not trust anyone. I always expect the worst.
I hate my actions, it finishes me off that people point out to me that I really live a great life. Do I have the right to anything? Do I have my own life?
For 4-5 months now, I have been thinking about suicide. I am tired of myself. Tired of others. Tired of people expecting a lot from me, although they themselves do not show enthusiasm, I am tired of two-faced people who will do anything for the sake of profit or personal encouragement.

My state of mind is killing me, it feels like I am not living, but surviving mentally. Despite the fact that in reality everything is fine. My mental state is really not normal. It feels like at one point I will burn out and just commit suicide. But most likely my other self will remind me that everything is fine, and I have no right to complain about a good life, I have no right to end it, stupidly because of my personal reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I irritate myself. My thoughts are filled with what people think of me or what they thought. I compare myself to others, although I receive compliments in my direction. I do not know how to perceive any good statements addressed to me, I can not trust anyone. I always expect the worst.
I hate my actions, it finishes me off that people point out to me that I really live a great life. Do I have the right to anything? Do I have my own life?
For 4-5 months now, I have been thinking about suicide. I am tired of myself. Tired of others. Tired of people expecting a lot from me, although they themselves do not show enthusiasm, I am tired of two-faced people who will do anything for the sake of profit or personal encouragement. I am tired of society. I tried to be social, I tried to be someone I am not. And at that moment, when I tried to open up my true self (after several years).

,depression_help,"I have depression. my depression was caused by life circumstances. I mean it was not due to chemical imbalance or genetics. it was because of the life I led and still lead. 

I have reached the point where I believe that for me there is no hope in anything. that in my future there are no good things waiting for me.

Every time I start talking about my situation, tears involuntarily start to come out Immediately literally.

I have family, acquaintances, neighbors and friends and yet I am unhappy and dissatisfied in the area of friendship, for example.

But don't believe when I say ""family"" I don't mean that my family is a loving family and all those things I'm just saying that I'm not a person who doesn't have anyone in my life. that doesn't mean That the people I have fill the need.

But well. I didn't really want to go into details, what I want to say is that it gets to the point where I have no hope, I do not want to continue fighting even though I can and I know that I still have a lot of strength, despite all that, I do not want to continue fighting by choice.That is to say, my desire is not to continue fighting even if I have the strength to do so.And the reason, rather, the reasons for the choice, is that that is my desire and also That my heart has been hurt too much.

Also at this point what I think is that this situation of mine is so difficult that it is easier if I were not alive To be alive because while I am now I am suffering a lot.

Finally, some notes: don't get me wrong, I like life, what I said is not in conflict with what I'm saying.

And finally he said I give him disgust and sorrow. I know it’s difficult to understand what depressed people are suffering but God I don’t deserve this kind of comments and it’s not the first time, months ago he said: “why are you punishing us this way?” while I was having the first anxiety attack of my life in front of him.

I feel like a real burden because I literally know I am, at the same way my friends hadn’t been supportive and finally they just disappeared.

I am sure if I had some support I could be better but this is going to end soon. Tired about: “I don’t know how to help you” “you don’t explain me anything” while I have been explaining again and again what’s happening to me.

,depression_help,"Will try to keep it brief;

Am 32M, UK. I've got a decent job (near £30k), I rent, I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and have a decent diet, as well as participating in other hobbies. I've joined ""Meet-Up"" groups and suchlike.

Despite being outgoing in nature, I've never had a girlfriend, the chief reason given to me is ""ugly"". That's not my personal opinion, that's just what's given to me. It is not a lack of confidence or opportunity to meet people. I had a few of one-night stands in my early to mid 20s, but that seems like a lifetime ago now.

I'm at a point where all of my friends are partnered up, married and mostly having children. Whereas 10 years ago I'd be invited out to something most weekends, that's all gone away now. My friends are all lovely people and I do believe they enjoy my company, but now if I don't chase them to organise something, they will not come to me to sort out a meet-up or suchlike. Individually they would all say they're just busy and got a lot of things on, and that's true, but collectively it creates a world where it feels like I have to keep chasing people otherwise I'll spend most of my time alone. It would feel nice for someone to come to me for once.

What this has led to, combined with being unwanted by women, is a feeling that I really don't have a place in this world. I go to work, I go to the gym, maybe see a few friends, but that's it. Whereas they all go home to their partners and families, I wake up and go to bed in a world where I have no-one. I didn't feel like this at 20, or 25, but the older I'm getting the feeling is now setting in and it's not going away.

Then there's Nathan, who frequently uses everyone for something and tbh is not an actual friend. I thought he was, turns out he was using me for his own selfish reasons. Like, I have a car and he doesnt. I feel like such a loser. None of my other friends like him either, he's an asshole.
Basically it started I was talking about to Nathan how Joe was being a jerk to a friend of mine. Nathan then goes to Joe and apparently makes up that I was saying all this stuff about Joe. Which isn't true. I got off work to this text from Joe saying this nasty condescending shit and the lines ""the only thing I expect to hear is an apology."" And that pissed me off. I laid into him how he's an asshole and an adult who cries about how he doesnt get his way. It was like a damn broke. Then he starts crying talking about how he's not invited to anything.

Basically he&amp;#39;d do things like throw extravagant events and cry when no one could make them, they weren&amp;#39;t mentioned until the day of.
Then there&amp;#39;s Nathan, who frequently uses everyone for something and tbh is not an actual friend. I thought he was, turns out he was using me for his own selfish reasons. Like, I have a car and he doesnt. I feel like such a loser. None of my other friends like him either, he&amp;#39;s an asshole.
Basically it started I was talking about to Nathan how Joe was being a jerk to a friend of mine. Nathan then goes to Joe and apparently makes up that I was saying all this stuff about Joe. Which isn&amp;#39;t true. I got off work to this text from Joe saying this nasty condescending shit and the lines &amp;quot;the only thing I expect to hear is an apology.&amp;quot; And that pissed me off. I laid into him how he&amp;#39;s an asshole and an adult who cries about how he doesnt get his way. It was like a damn broke. Then he starts crying talking about how he&amp;#39;s not invited to anything. Was I being manipulated? I think so. I&amp;#39;ve been crying because I know these aren&amp;#39;t my friends but I&amp;#39;m scared to start over. Please someone help me.&lt;/p&gt;

I Overdosed on Propranolol and Nytol – My Story of Hallucinations &amp; Losing Control

Hey folks! I’m setting up this subreddit to share my experience and see if anyone else has been through something like this. So, I overdosed on propranolol and Nytol recently, and things got weird – I had some crazy visual and auditory hallucinations. On top of that, I lost almost all my motor skills, which was honestly terrifying.

The hallucinations were terrifying. I was seeing my friends that weren’t there, hearing sounds that made my skin crawl having conversations. My brain felt like it was messing with me at every level, and I couldn’t tell what was real anymore. Honestly one of the scariest things I’ve ever gone through.

Since then, I’ve been feeling... weirdly numb. In addition Psychedelics have really messed with my sense of reality, and I’m constantly questioning what’s real and what’s not. After my last bad trip, I just couldn’t tell if I was out of psychosis or still stuck in it. It’s been a blur. I've decided to cut out all substances because they were making me feel like bugs were crawling on my skin (formication, look it up!). Now, I just feel like I’m floating – no real thoughts, no real feelings... just kind of floating.

(I can definitely dive deeper into my hallucinations if anyone’s curious!)

I’m really curious to know if anyone else has had something like this happen – either with these drugs or others. How did you get through it? What helped you recover? Drop your stories, ask questions, or whatever – let’s support each other and spread the word about how dangerous med misuse can be.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I really hope this space becomes helpful for anyone who needs it.

TL;DR: Overdosed on propranolol and Nytol, had some intense, terrifying hallucinations, and lost control of my body. Looking to hear if anyone else has gone through this.

Unless you got a lot of money. Plus, my friend circle just collapsed in on itself recently. I have MAYBE one friend left. 

Recently, everyone I know are having kids and or are getting married. I'm here feeling alone, feeling sad, and sorry for myself. Plus, I feel like I am a burden to others and everyone hates me...

,depression_help,"hi,
I’m not really sure where to post this but I need help. I’m currently a senior in college and I’ve been super depressed for a couple of months now. (I also have adhd and anxiety and am medicated for both) This month it’s gotten really bad. I’ve stopped showing up to class and doing my homework, I hardly eat anymore, I either sleep all day or not at all, and I just feel so miserable. My parents constantly ask about my grades and classes but I’ve just kept lying to them so they aren’t disappointed. I don’t think I can graduate this year. I wanted to believe that I could get out of the mess myself but I just can’t. I need help. I know if I told my mom this she would take it seriously and help me but I can’t get myself to tell her i’m struggling. I want to tell her in person but I know if I did I’d chicken out or start sobbing and not be able to tell her everything I need to. I’ve thought about sending her a message with all of my thoughts in it but i’m worried that my dad will see it. (Not that he wouldn’t be supportive, he just doesn’t take mental health as seriously.

I’m not really sure where to post this but I need help. I’m currently a senior in college and I’ve been super depressed for a couple of months now. (I also have adhd and anxiety and am medicated for both) This month it’s gotten really bad. I’ve stopped showing up to class and doing my homework, I hardly eat anymore, I either sleep all day or not at all, and I just feel so miserable. My parents constantly ask about my grades and classes but I’ve just kept lying to them so they aren’t disappointed. I don’t think I can graduate this year. I wanted to believe that I could get out of the mess myself but I just can’t. I need help. I know if I told my mom this she would take it seriously and help me but I can’t get myself to tell her i’m struggling. I want to tell her in person but I know if I did I’d chicken out or start sobbing and not be able to tell her everything I need to. I’ve thought about sending her a message with all of my thoughts in it but i’m worried that my dad will see it. (Not that he wouldn’t be supportive, he just doesn’t take mental health as seriously. He’s also harder on me about my grades and school.) I need help but I’m terrified to reach out. I know deep down that it will be fine once I tell them. I just don’t know how to make that leap.

Instagram is today full of posts about mental health awareness and people is commenting about it like “oh yeah it’s super important “ but well people, is that your opinion in real life? I mean, my reality is that everyone has judged me and pushed me away even I was asking for help as crazy, they say that phrases you know as well and even that I choose being this way. I have been abandoned by everyone even they tried to my boyfriend break up with me, even my father reaction to when I finally told him I am suic*adal was terrible and he said I was seeking attention…

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety all my life but I was functional although I was suffering inside. But now I can’t work and do anything, at my almost 42, and this is what I got of “my people”.

So it’s almost ironic people faking being so conscious about it and it was even “funny” seeing that friend who pushed me away and tried my bf to leave me, seeing her like on a post about suicide haha while her friend is literally dying and they know 100%

So why is people so fake? I think this is even more painful for us. If this was true I could explain to everyone I am depressed instead of being isolated at home thinking I am a burden and weak and ironically when I told to my 3 friends and my father this is exactly how they acted to me..

This world it’s insane and this make ourself even feel more sick, at least this is my experience and I read all of people complaining about the same. This lack of empathy is what make us feel even worst.

,depression_help,"Yo. Burner because reasons. 

So I M34 have just wasted like a year of my life and probably approaching the last of my savings. Last November I quit my job at the grocery and I've done jack-all since. The plan was to take a month or two to get my shit together and dig into some hobbies, and I did, but then I got sick for a bit and it threw me totally off kilter. In that time I've sent it like I don't know, maybe 3 job applications and even got a call back but never returned it. 

I'm just exhausted, or at least I was and that's why I quit my job, now I'm just well defeated I guess. I looked back fondly to my COVID times unemployment which was great except for the past where I was literally pulling my hair out worrying about my immuno-compromised mom. But it was great, I had friends online available at any time and eager to do something, I got to do nothing and not feel any pressure over it because not working allowed me to go visit with my folks with minimal fear of exposing my mom to it, I had my apartment reasonably clean at basically all times and I was enjoying cooking. Turns out that's not the case anymore

I was exhausted because while I liked my job actually the management was such a fucking shit show. Three years there and I went through a literal dozen department heads, 3 GMs, God knows how many assistant GMs. My department had an employee turnover rate worse than the management and I got to train most of those one week hires. It took me 2 months to get a fucking squeegee replaced and that only happened because I snapped one morning and cussed out the GM in front of some visiting higher up, like a regional guy or something. 

So that's what I mean when I say I was exhausted, I was burnt totally and completely. Miserable to be around, taking no shit from anyone, constantly telling the assistant manager of my department to just let the department fail instead of letting them abuse her and guilt her into working 60 hour weeks plus however much she was working off the clock. They would steal her away for hours to man the Starbucks even though we had a staff of 4 and 112 hours of open time a week. 

I'm getting too hung up on my still simmering rage over it. Point is I've done nothing. Completed a single personal project I set out for myself, can't keep the apartment clean, minimal cooking motivation though I've had some minor success there. I've stayed inside long enough to have developed a severe vitamin D deficiency (which I'm being treated for)

How the hell do I pull myself out of this slump? I'm reading some manga today and a character totally breaks down after a failed relationship and I'm looking at this panel and it's just like ""Jesus Christ this is how I've spent my whole goddamn year.""

It's not like I'm not trying to do something, I've tried to organize a D&amp;D oneshot to run, joined some games with randos, periodically hang out with my one local friend, cooked some cool things now and then. Things to break the routine of apathy, but I keep falling back into it.

So I don't know what I'm even looking for here but telling someone something has gotta be better than just laying here in a sheetless bed from attempted laundry months ago with half my assorted shit on it from a failed cleaning attempt a week ago with the other half now kicked off back onto the floor and listening to Phoebe Bridges Funeral on repeat so I can force myself to cry.

I felt like I was glued to my car and could not will myself to get out or call for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe going inside these places will help me since I am only passively suicidal and not actively planning to kill myself. The healthcare system where I live is so overwhelmed that I believe that once they see that I have a family doctor and a therapist they would discharge me. I don’t believe I can communicate my condition well enough to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only left my apartment today because I have to go back to work on Thursday after a two week break. I had the entire break to get help and instead spent it in bed barely able to feed/bathe myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now home and in bed, exhausted and dehydrated. I want to call the crisis line but am paralyzed by the thought of calling for help still. I don’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"25f. All my life I've felt trapped. I grew up with an extreme BPD mother that kept me in my room. I wasn't allowed to go outside, listen to certain music, watch ""demonic"" movies(harry potter, wizards of waverly place) 🙄, etc. Add forced sleep deprivation and emotional abuse.

Due to such limitations, I would hyper focus on self improvement, skill building, and hobbies. Eventually the hobbies would burn out, and I was often left staring at my ceiling. When I tuned 18, I left for college with new hopes of creating my life. I joined communities, explored classes, and traveled to the city. 

Unfortunately, this was the first time I could apply the skills I taught myself and things didn't go as planned. I never found any friends, never found enjoyment in the things I did, never figured out what I wanted to do with my life, and I failed college. Covid happened and I back home I went😥. 

But I couldn't give up. I decided to focus on 1-2 things. My career and building relationships. In 2021, when places started opening back up, I began hosting volunteer events, attending meetups, bumble BFF, and continued going out alone. For my career, I got accepted to a software engineering apprenticeship.

Sounds promising right? Unfortunately, the only people I met were a-holes, and miserable people. I still haven't found fulfillment in any activities. This was extremely inconsistent due to my environment, my mom, and lack of finance. Not even enough money for transportation. And by the time I earned enough skills and experience to earn 100k+ entry job, the tech industry blew up. Again, despite my best efforts, I spent too much time in my head alone, talking to the walls.

Fasting forward, our house burned down with terrible insurance, haven't had a job in 1.5 years, spirituality abandoned me, credit went from 760 to 550, left the country broke and alone, returned to U.S. started using social media.

Still I haven't given up. but again I'm so done with everything. Endless efforts and no results. I've been doing my best to enjoy and focus on the little things, stay present in the moment, eating the best I can and getting movement in. I'm reading ' High Magick' by Damien echols. I'm still puting in job applications and brain storming ideas on what to do next, taking smaller steps, but I'm so over everything.

 I have no car, no friends, no job, no passion, no enjoyment, no change in my pocket. I share a room and bed with my mom. I'm tired of taking walks, reading countless books, doing everything alone. I've learned to enjoy my own company, and I'm forever grateful for the independence and power it gave me, but I'm ready to focus on more things that are not myself.

The only reason I've made it this far is because I believe in myself. I believe that there are good things out there for me and that I'm capable of achieving them. I'm doing it for my inner kid that never got her childhood, for my heart that's never known freedom.

It's really hard for me to ask for help, and I think drinking really makes it easier for me.

She told me that if I won't stop with this she will have to hospitalize me. Idk if i should, Maybe it will help me but i have never been there before so I'm scared.

Sometimes i have triggers of the night she killed herself, and the search for her.

I had a lot of guilt, I felt I could tell her Something that would make her stay, but after a lot of sessions with my psychologist It had helped me a lot with the guilt.

,depression_help,"First off, thank you for reading this. In regard to the title above, I’m struggling to make friends and not sure what to do. I’m 31 and married to a wonderful woman, who I’m blessed to have. With that said, my whole life Im unable to fit in with anyone (excluding my wife.) For example, I always have to reach out to family for them to text me back, and have tried going month’s without texting them just to see if they will text me back but don’t. Also when I go out to a restaurant with my family or my wife’s family, I’ve noticed everyone always buddies up, where I’m left out and unable to talk. When I’m finally able to get a word in, either I’m ignored or given a short answer like yes or no, while everyone else will be chatting it up. I have brought this to my wife attention, and she has seen this unusual circumstance as in seeing how my family or her family treats me. My wife tried to fix this by including me in conversations with my family or hers, yet it always comes down to me getting left out. My wife also gave me helpful advice on meeting new people, by doing activities that I’m interested in, such as top golf/bowling/swimming/hiking/bars/fishing/restaurants, churches, cooking classes, etc. I managed to do all of these activities in the search of finding a friend, but had no luck. The people I did meet ended up doing what my family does, which is budding up with others or eventually ghosting me. I tried my best in trying to get to know them and their hobbies, while being positive yet none of that was reciprocated, as in they never ask me any questions about  myself  Lastly, my whole work life has been like this. Every time we go to meeting/lunches/office parties, everyone buddies up and I’m left out yet again. I feel like I’ve exhausted all my resources on trying to make friends or keeping my family, but always falls flat. Wanted to note that I have good hygiene, no disabilities, great job, loving wife.

,depression_help,"I (25F) used to think I could not talk to my father. Today I realized I cannot talk to my mother either. She has always been telling him and apparently, the whole family things I told her in confidence. There is a strong disconnect like I do not belong, and no matter how much I try to see this place and these people as mine, I simply cannot. 

I want to explain what I think is the root of this problem. There have been multiple instances of verbal and mental abuse throughout my life. But due to cultural and generational reasons, and probably a huge difference in mindset, this is considered ""normal"" parenting. I have been told that the only reason they did that to me was either out of love, to protect me, or because I was the one who provoked them, and should have been careful to begin with. 

Mind you, this is fully grown adults telling me that I as a child should have been mindful of their mood before saying or doing something. This continues till date, although I have learned to simply stay quiet in my corner. However, even this is seen as a problem because they think they did nothing wrong and I am the one in the wrong. So they expect me to mingle and laugh with them like nothing ever happened. They complain that I never smile, that I don't confide in them. They argue that they have forgiven me so they don't understand why I am still so stuck up. 

I don't know how to make peace with the fact that there is nothing I can do to change that.  Where I live, it is common for adult children to live in their family's house. But I am trying my best to move away and find a job elsewhere. I was hoping the physical distance will help me slowly disconnect from these people but I am having a hard time with it. Obviously, things are not happening at the pace and timing that I need. I was confident when I started but now I am losing hope. And honestly, I am exhausted. 

Is there anything I am not able to figure out? Please know, I am not in a situation to go for therapy without their knowledge. Even if I do, it is considered taboo.

,depression_help,"At the start of the year, my depression reactivated from losing my job due to a stupid HR rule (contractors cannot stay onboard for more than 3 years). I spiraled when I realized the job I worked so hard towards gave my co-worker with no design experience a SENIOR design position. My ex-manager also received a promotion in the new year as Creative Manager. I feel like they solely got promoted because I had to leave and they are working off of my hard work.

During the first 8 months of this year, I would get consistent flashbacks of conversations I had with my manager about promotions, the long nights I stayed up to finish work, the extra miles I took on projects to appease my manager and the team, etc. Every time I had a flashback I would burst out into tears. I'm even trying to stop myself from bursting into tears now. It was so bad that I actually opted for the medication route until I couldn't pay for my health insurance anymore.

I'm still unemployed and I feel like it still bothers me because I'm struggling to find employment and I'm just going through the ringer. It also still bothers me because I believe my ex-manager faked as if she was trying to get me promoted up until the end of 2023, only to use me to complete projects that her new Senior Content Designer could have finished. It doesn't sound or feel like she really fought for me. I was let go 12/31/2023 and she texted me in February of this year acting like she cared. She only texted me to make sure I send my work laptop back. I blocked her via phone and on LinkedIn for my better good and mental state. But I've given my all to each job in my career. I've never been promoted though I perform in roles, which I carry the load of the team. It makes me sick and I can't shake it. I just want a stable job with good pay and benefits. I've never had that.

Things have only gotten worse after being unemployed for 10+ months. My credit score has taken more than a 100 point hit. I can't apply for a personal loan to help me with my bills and everyday needs, even the ones geared towards bad credit. I'm fully dependent on my boyfriend at this point, which is probably not attractive to him. Besides him, I have no support system and I'm really scared that we'll break up if I don't find a job soon. No basic jobs will hire me because I'm ""too experienced"" or they think I'll leave once a better opportunity comes. My phone just got cut off yesterday. I used up my unemployment benefits at this point and I'm waiting to see if they will approve me for more. I used to smoke medicinal marijuana to deal with the harshness of life but I stopped to just secure *any* job. I barely scraped up enough money for rent this month. I can't even afford a therapist, which is why I'm here. I just don't know how to move on until I find a better job and it feels like the depression won't leave until that point. I feel like I'm running out of options.

I truly don't know the point of this post as I'm writing it. I just feel like I'm at the whim of everyone and everything at all times. It's depressing. I feel too vulnerable like I can end up on the streets at any moment if one more thing happens. My boyfriend is trying his hardest to uplift me during this time and I'm so grateful to have him in my life but I also don't want to burden him. I constantly regret being born.

My boyfriend is trying his hardest to uplift me during this time and I&amp;#39;m so grateful to have him in my life but I also don&amp;#39;t want to burden him. I constantly regret being born. I just need some help dealing with my thoughts on all of this. Any and all help would be nice. Thank you for reading if you got this far.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi I'm 20 years old, and right now, I'm not doing well at all. I've felt sad before in my life, but this time it’s different. Dark thoughts are haunting me, thoughts telling me to hurt myself, to scar myself, and I don’t even understand why.

I  have friends, a mother who loves me... and yet, I feel terribly bad. I can’t understand how I can be so unhappy when I have people who care about me. What’s even worse is that I tell myself I don’t deserve this happiness. I don’t deserve any of it.

I think it all started with a relationship I had with a girl who was going through depression. We ended up breaking up, and of course, she said all the usual things, like how I’m a good person, that it wasn’t my fault… But none of that ever left me. I still feel guilty, terribly guilty, for leaving her. I abandoned her when she was at her worst, when she needed me the most. How could I have done that? It feels like I turned my back on someone who was drowning. And that’s something I can’t forgive myself for.

The guilt is so strong that I tell myself I don’t deserve any happiness anymore. I don’t deserve anything. I abandoned someone when she needed me most, so how can I allow myself to be happy today? I don’t have the right. What I did makes me unworthy of any kind of joy, and every time I feel even a little bit happy, there’s this voice inside me that reminds me I don’t deserve it. That I shouldn’t be happy after what I’ve done. It feels like I’m carrying this burden with me all the time, and the more I try to move forward, the more it pulls me back.

That said, this story with my ex, I’ve left it behind. It was a year ago. I don’t think about her anymore, I’ve moved on. I don’t feel the pain of the breakup anymore, but recently, these dark thoughts have started to appear, and I don’t understand why. Maybe, somehow, it all comes from there. Maybe that guilt, buried somewhere deep inside me, has finally resurfaced.

The worst part is that this feeling of being down when I’m alone creates something toxic. When I’m with my friends, when I laugh, when I feel good, that voice comes back even stronger, telling me I’m a fraud. That I have no right to be happy when, as soon as I get home, I’m overwhelmed by these dark thoughts. The more good times I have with others, the guiltier I feel afterward. It’s a vicious cycle I can’t break, and every time, I feel even worse.

The urge to hurt myself is growing stronger. Sometimes, it feels like it’s the only thing I truly deserve. But what still holds me back is fear. This fear of crossing a line I can never undo. I’m afraid that if I start hurting myself, I won’t be able to stop, that it’ll be too late, that there’ll be no way back.

I know I should see a therapist. I know that. But waiting to get an appointment feels like it’s taking forever.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/s/4bst95y0in

So it’s been almost 4 years since I last posted my previous post and my life has changed quite a bit. I’m 22 now, and since that post was made I’ve moved away from my parents then moved back after a year and a half. I’m engaged to the same guy I was with back then, we have our ups and downs but ultimately I am happy. It’s the longest and most serious relationship I’ve ever been in and I enjoy learning and growing with him. I’ve since decided that I don’t want kids at all, so I think the abortion may have been a blessing in disguise. I’ve been through a few jobs since then and I’ve met some amazing people that I am so so grateful for, I think will be in my life for a long time. I started writing a releasing music and in a few weeks it will be a year since I’ve released my first single. I am immensely proud of myself because I couldn’t have dreamed of going back to my roots like this all that time ago. Life is still hard, which is unsurprising but I now have the support to make it a little easier. My relationship with my parents is still complicated but overall I think it’s gotten a little bit better over the years. I still struggle with my depression but my fiancé is always there to help me get through it and I could not be more grateful to have him in my life. I’m currently working and saving to move out again, hopefully I do it right this time. There isn’t a date for the wedding as of right now, we’re just enjoying being engaged and loving each other but I am preparing to decide soon. Unfortunately I’m still not in therapy but I am looking to start again very soon. I’m very grateful that I had the will power to continue living to see what the next day had in store for me. I really want to thank the one person who commented on my last post, it gave me the extra push I needed at the time to get through everything I was going through. Sometimes I can’t believe that was me feeling that way all that time ago. I was in a really dark place and though I still struggle, I at least have my head above the water.

,depression_help,"I’ve been sad before, but i think this is the first time I’m legitimately depressed. 

I don’t wanna write a long story because i feel like yall don’t really wanna read all of that. Essentially a few years ago when i was 27 i gave up nearly every to chase my dream of being a pilot. It cost me my wife, i gave up my government relations/lobbying career, and ultimately i accomplished my goal by the age of 29 and got hired to fly private charter until i got my 1500 hours to be eligible to fly for a major airline

I gave up everything, moved to Florida and took a 75% salary reduction to fly for the charter company knowing that it would be temporary and i could transition to a major airline in a year or two. Well, i ended up only getting scheduled about once a month for an entire year for the charter company… so i barely gained any hours, barely had any money to live off of, found myself driving uber to make rent, and ultimately had to quit because i could not afford to work that job anymore. 

Now im back doing a career i hate (lobbying/government affairs work), for a company that treats me like crap, I’m still grossly underpaid, all of my bills are past due, my credit score went from a 720 to 480, my wife has left me, and like i just feel completely shattered and broken. I bet on myself and I lost. I have never felt like this in my life. Every moment of every day for the past 3 months it feels like I’m going to randomly burst into tears. Tearing up even while writing this. 

My question is, how do i pull myself out of this depression. This is terrible, i do not want to feel like this. What can i do to stop this feeling? I’m determined to feel better. I have to feel better. I’m not sure I’ll last another month of feeling like this.

I have, overall, been masturbating less since my attempts, going from multiple times a day to only a few times a month.

I haven't tried talking to others about it because I feel it would change how my friends, parents, and family view me forever.

Every time the bout of depression ends, after a lot of patience, inner work, letting life do its thing, and letting the bad times/circumstances pass... I feel an enormous relief, I begin to feel happy and excited to live, and I feel convinced I will never go back to the dark cave of depression again.

But then, a few months go by and it comes again.

I'm scared to think that the rest of my life will look like this, with depression following me like an illness and showing up every now and then. While I have been strong in the past, I'm scared that the next time it shows up -- or the next time after that -- I won't be as strong and do something dumb.

I don't want to take meds/pills for it because I feel like I've managed to overcome my bouts of depression in the past and I'm generally freaked out by the pharma industry and getting hooked on pills (I have an addictive personality), but I feel exhausted of having to live life while secretly struggling with this.

In the past, I was able to sort of deal with it because I was in a long-term relationship with a supportive partner who did their best to support me through it all and accept me as I was, but my depression took its toll on the relationship and eventually it ended; so now I don't have anyone to talk to.

I say goodnight and good morning whenever I am not with them and now everything is different. I am back to having no one to talk to and being completely alone. They at least still have friends and even though I am trying I find it so hard to make friends and I don’t even fully understand what they mean when they say they want a break, are we just not talking for a while or are we not together full stop? And I can’t ask them this because I can’t speak to them and it’s just so awful  I just don’t know how to live my life when they are not in it, it’s just so empty now I don’t know how to function.

It’s just not fair because neither of us even did anything wrong and yet I am having to face this punishment.

,depression_help,"I [20M] have been together with my long-distance girlfriend [20F] for over 2 years now. We began dating after being friends through Minecraft Roleplay. We both enjoyed this hobby a lot, and took part in it together. For the early stages of our relationship it is what bound us together. I did a lot of things like storylines and videos and so on that she loved me for, as she put it. Of course we also love each other indepentently of that, and we do other things as well.

The problem is that my last year in the world of minecraft RP has been a harsh one. The projects i had made and put a big amount of time and money into for around 100 people had repeatedly failed and died after mere weeks or days. The people started to ignore me and my peers (project organizers) all turned out to be very jealous and hateful people.
After seeing all of that and experiencing that failure, i left the scene because i felt severely hurt by it and the people in it.

Most of my online friends were connected to that community, and after going I had a lot of mental problems. I felt depressed for months. During that time my girlfriend started working in a team which was previously my ""rival"" team. She had asked me if she could join, because she loves MC RP, and trying not to hold her down, I agreed to her joining the team - it was her choice after all. But in asking that she didnt really specify what she meant. 

While I thought it was about helping out for their next project as temporary support, she apparently meant it as a permanent membership, which should last for years and mean that she would be busy with that every evening from 7pm to 10pm, plus some extra things irregularly outside those times.

Now that she has been in the team for a few months, I feel like I lose a lot of her time and focus to something I was hurt by in the past. The fact that it is a team I competed with also feels quite bad for me. I kind of feel like I cant move on, because her being in the team and putting so much time and effort in keeps reminding me of my past troubles. It still is a huge part of her life, since it's her (and was my) biggest hobby. So the solution of ""lets just not talk about it"" sadly doesnt really work.

Eventually, i asked her if she could leave the team so that we might move on together and maybe find a new community. I know, this was wrong - I cannot dictate her hobbies, but I had wished that she would stick to me rather than activities, since those are interchangeable (at least for me) and she always seemed to have the most fun with me.

She has denied this, and wants to remain where she is. While I understand that, I still feel kind of left alone in my troubles with this huge chunk of my life that I had to leave, and the grief it caused me. It feel like I am second place to something I was beat at before, and it makes me incredibly insecure and sad. I somehow had wished that we would stick together no matter what the external influences are.

It seems like maybe the thing that got us together might rip us apart now. She has requested that we don't talk for a week, and through our latest talk I noticed she started contemplating a breakup.

Any time I hadnt put into RP or my work always went straight to her, and I must admit that she is the only real joy in my life. I do not know what I would do if she left me. Not talking for a week alone is excruciating, but never again? I just feel left alone entirely.

I would like to address something anonymously.

A year ago, I developed Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS), which led to severe panic attacks. I’m in treatment and learning to cope with it, but I still often have moments when the symptoms get worse and I feel overwhelmed with fear. These situations often arise when I’m dating someone or talking to new people. I always hide the anxiety because, unfortunately, the world expects us to function “normally.”

My girlfriend left me back then when I started having panic attacks because she said my “baggage” was too “heavy” for her, and many friends found it strange that I ended up in a psychiatric clinic afterward. I find it exhausting that I have to suppress my emotions and can’t simply express what’s going on inside me.

I just don’t want to be alone, and I know that if I show my true self, I’ll be left behind. But this constant pretending is so incredibly draining that after two hours around people, even though I’m naturally extroverted, I can’t handle it anymore and just want to be alone again so I can give my fear the space it needs and let it out.

I’m asking for tips and help.

for background, my father was abusive and she was with him for a while until I was almost two and we left our home country. I’ve always been curious about him but now knowing he’s a drunk and an asshole I’d rather not know. Through the years as I grew up everything seemed fine and I was quite happy until I turned 8. I also grew up in an apartment with druggies and psychos. That was only for a year and my mother called the police every time they acted up, they would run around naked in the halls, and try to light the building on fire. That I think kind of affected me a little but I was really close to my mother also and suddenly she became a bit more distant because she met my stepdad at the time, then I started getting bullied and harassed in fourth grade, and I started to form addictions. I was addicted to watching porn and gore. It was an interesting experience to say the least. Things went on by 6th grade it was my first attempt at ending my life. Every day of 6th I would have terrible panic attacks and I wasn’t able to breath sometimes. That one day I headed down to the forest near my house and I tried to drown in the lake. Soon I realized it was too shallow and a stupid idea, I ended up calling the kids help line and they got the police to my house. My mom was so angry with me, I wanted to tell the police what was wrong but I just couldn’t. I told them everything was fine only to see them again a year later. I ended up becoming addicted to self harming also and ended up going to the ward for 2 weeks. After that in grade 8 I went to the ward for a day after attempting to end my life again. Grade 9 I attempted again but I begged the teachers not to call the police, they just called my mom and I ended up being fine. Every single day of my life I’ve been dragged down with the guilt from over the years and I just want to end it so that my mom doesn’t feel traumatized by me. I just don’t want her to worry. It seems selfish but there’s so much money my parents have spent on me to help me and make me happy. I feel so terrible because nothing works. I don’t know what to do. My mom has also recently been going over how I’ve made her have ptsd, and how it doesn’t only affect me, it affects her too. I just wish she knew I was doing it for her.

,depression_help,"Since my last post, I started getting better. After watching some videos. And reaching out to some friends that I trust. 
I did go to therapy twice it helped me. 
I''ll keep going.


And again I started feeling like myself.
Well I'm thinking about trying again to start a business. 

As pickup trucks are rare and expensive in Serbia. 
I'm thinking about starting import business. Where I would import used trucks and SUVs from US. 
As work vehicles.

Now the problem is that. Do US companies that use pickups as work vehicles sell them in bulk on lower price than market?? 

Because if I buy pickup at lower price,
Import tax is lower which means that I can sell it at lower price and still have about 15% profit. 

As I plan on selling them to smaller construction companies that aren't able to afford 15k-20k per truck. 

Now reason for that is that the driver's license in Serbia are different and for most of work vehicles you need category D which is for big trucks like semi and similar. But category B is for cars and pickup trucks are registered to category B that most of people have. 
So pickups even tho rare and expensive are more wanted as work vehicles.

 So yes I'm doing better and I'm back to myself. 

Thank you 
If you know anything that could help me with this.

,depression_help,"I could get into my backstory, but to try to keep it simple: I'm a 28 year old black woman with BPD. I'm still not healed from childhood trauma of being abused, the fact that my family including my parents don't value emotional support, are dysfunctional, and that my parents never met my expectations of them by not being abusive and instead being emotionally supportive and nurturing parents. Being the person that I am I've always been the black sheep of my family and it always felt like I was being punished for existing. 

Back in 2019, I was living my aunt after fleeing from my mother's house when we got into it cause I was holding her accountable for where she fell short as a parent, she called my dad and of course he didn't hear me out or take my side. It was very heated. My dad is very intimidating. He talks in a loud stern voice. He's never been the one to physically punish me. It was always my mom. 

However in 2019 my father put his hands on me. I was 23 at the time. He tackled me to the ground and this was time I was living with my aunt, his sister. She wrongfully accused me of drinking all her beer when I wasn't drinking at the time due to being on anti-depressants. She called him into the kitchen to get me in trouble and he pushed and held me down to the ground like a police officer. Mind you during the 2 years I lived with my aunt, my father lives directly across the street from her cause he's her tenant. During that time I was always triggered and sad that my dad never ever in is life took the time to bond with me, get to know me as his daughter, make any effort as a parent outside of the bare minimum which is financially provide and be a resource. Even with me living across the street from him. So all of that was built up then he did the worse thing which was physically abuse me. It broke me. I moved from my aunt's cut my family off for about 2 years then ended up breaking no contact while living somewhere else. 

I still ruminate over all of this and is a major contribution to my BPD and depression. Now having evicted and my only option now is living with him and my stepmom. They have my little brother is 5  years old. My stepmom constantly yell at him for everything, whoops him. Her daughter has a daughter that younger than my brother so that's his niece but more like his little sister. She's over here often so it's both of them including our small dog. 

It's an extremely stressful, triggering environment for me. I'm trying to be grateful and take this as a blessing to have some sort of stability and stack up but idk how I can work on myself to get out of here when my depression and emotions play such a huge role in how I navigate life.  When I lost my job, I fell into an even deeper depression that I already was in. This was one of my many bottoms of it going into ideation. Before I was depressed but at least I didn't want to die. This time my ideation is strong and now having to come here is killing the little hope I have. I'm also scared that my ways will get me in trouble over here like it always does. I'm scared I'm going to do something that causes my dad to hurt me again.

,depression_help,"I need help, whether that I'm depressed or not, could be a buzzword, but it mentally affects me. This has been going on for a year, and maybe continuing further if they can persists. This is a case of being mind-reading, and consequently, it affects my relationships, friendships and to strangers I've never met, to be hostile towards me. Probably they bear a one-sided hatred for such and don't understand much of it, but it seems they are quite knowledgeable of the whole situation and even following it quite recently. From what I've observed, is that they also have a coordinated step to verbally harassing me.

Being in this hellhole for a constant frequency over a year, could significantly shape someone's damn mind, and i get confounded when they justify this whole shit show, just to do it everyday, criticizing my gameplay, my hobbies and activities, no substance other than to reinforce their bullshit. My insults are futile against them, all i could do is lie limp and be desperate for something to save the day.

Probably they bear a one-sided hatred for such and don&amp;#39;t understand much of it, but it seems they are quite knowledgeable of the whole situation and even following it quite recently.

,depression_help,"I'm 17, nearing the end of my last year of school. I suffer from depression and anxiety and I feel that, especially since lockdown hit four years ago, I've locked myself off from the rest of the world. And now I just feel lonely, because I really wish I could express myself in front of others, but I just can't, so I just feel worthless, and as if all I'm worth is sitting down and doing nothing.

I do have friends in what feels like a general sense. I have people who I hang out with. But there's nobody who I feel I can truly express myself in front of. There's nobody I can cry in front of or get excited in front of, or just straight up express my interests with. I'm just this person who stands back and doesn't speak. But there's so much bubbling up inside me I just can't stand it anymore. But I just can't speak to people without choking on my words or embarrassing myself.

I feel like I've wasted my life. Everyone has people who they are so close to at this point in life, I just don't. I'm not expecting anything of anyone, this is my fault. Everyone has their own personality, mine is buried inside of me.

I've attempted suicide multiple times just this last month. I'm just so lost. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like this might have just been a pointless rant but I hope someone understands what I'm going through

If you're therapist says eat right get enough sleep they know what there talking about.

Practice good hygiene. Keep your space clean.

And most importantly do the therapeutic activities. Learn tiggers learn patterns. Learn coping skills learn breathing exercises Keep a journal.

To get out of the house met people and engage in my interest I was told to volunteer.

I finally learned what made me happy lake rivers hike frams apple picking strawberry picking blueberry picking pumpkin patch ice skating sledding snow tubing.

,depression_help,"Once you are in high school, your internal negative self-talk slightly dampens down, and maybe this is why you start assuming that as you get older, this bad way you feel about yourself might naturally drift away, as if it were a mysterious part of puberty.

To concoct a fallacy this off-base, you need to have an immensely distorted view of how ""effortless"" life appears to be for adults. Teachers and doctors may appear to be wise and confident. Dad can fix all the problems around the house, but that doesn't mean everything's hunky-dory for these people.

Adults are human, and they struggle too. They've accumulated a s\*\*\*load more practice than you at hiding it though. And they may not spend a single second of their day fretting about finishing their homework or talking to a girl, but that's because they have their own kinds of fears and doubts and worries.

Over the years, this belief cumulatively inflicts damage on your mental health as you counter feelings of anxiety, awkwardness, nervousness, self-doubt, and a lack of confidence with a mental reminder that:

*Once I grow up, the discomfort in life magically ends. Grown-up’s don't feel like I do anymore. I can’t wait to grow up!*

Sorry dude. I wish you figured this out much earlier. It would have forced us to learn how to accept with and deal with our feelings instead of pushing them under the rug and waiting for them to vanish.

Finding this out the hard way will be a slow and agonizing process. Time passes and you become an adult. You go on to experience heartbreak, anxiety over school, social anxiety, shame, embarrassment, and struggle with mental illness. And this hope you were clinging to, of miraculously waking up “fixed,” makes it feel increasingly frustrating. Over the years, you achieve great milestones in life; you finish graduate school, become a doctor, then become a father, but your emotions are not getting calmer. In fact, those feelings grow bigger, **stronger**, **LOUDER.**

&lt;p&gt;I tell my parents all this they say I am thinking too much something is wrong with me...I shout loud 
I am wrong then..
I can&amp;#39;t understand this world I can&amp;#39;t understand anything &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expressing myself if my tone gets higher after all this does not mean I am wrong &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop it please stop it&lt;/p&gt;

My English is not perfect and I have dyslexia, so I hope that you all can read it. 

My boyfriend had been fysical sick past weekend. 
He told me that he had suïcide thoughts last friday. 

I told him I was very proud of him for admidding it to me and not doing it. 
I always ask him if I can do something for him, but the past days it was, no I dont think so, but he says that all the time.

I tried to make him spend the night with me so he was not alone. He did that two nights. 
I also tried to distract him with nice things to do, and asked him if he wanted to do something, play a game, go outside. All of that he did not want. 

I pushed him to talk to his therapist about how he felt, his own therapist is on vacation, so he told the back up. He did not do anything, just said, that he wanted to see him more often. 

Then this afternoon I got a text if I was already tutoring, I wasn’t. 

He texted me that I had to come over asap, and I had to bring the key, because he did not know if he was able to open the door. 
He also told me not to be scared of the way I would find him. 

I called an ambulance and drove over there. Hè did indeed try to end his live. He drank halve a bottle of vodka, and took a lot of pills. 
I held him while he was throwing up in the sink. The ambulance was there before me. 
He had cut himself on his arms, and left a note not to call his family if he survived and that he hoped it worked this time because he could no longer do this. 

He was brought to the ambulance and I drove with him to the hospital. 
He said he did not regret it. 
He is doing better, gets the care he needs and they are gonna contact his therapist to make a plan, a better plan. 

I was not allowed to stay the night, so I went home to my own place, threw all my alcohol away, and put al the alcohol glasses away. 
I don’t want him feeling triggered. 

I want to do so much more for him, I just want to take his pain away and not make him feel so bad. 

But now I am home, trying to sleep. Wondering what I could have done better, and what I can do for him now. 

He wanted to come home with me tonight, but I convinced him to stay in the hospital because he could get worse in the night. 

I just love him so so much. I hope he survives the night.

,depression_help,"Husband (38) is severely depressed and has expressed that he's losing hope that things will turn around. He's been diagnosed, as of September, with Bipolar II and has PTSD. We are also expecting our first child in January 2025.

It's hard to know where to start to explain this journey, but will do a bulleted list to try to be concise( if possible)

* Had worked at a ""dream job"" for 2 years but his contract ended Sept '23 (not due to performance, but because they only budgeted for a 2 year contract -- which he knew when taking the job) which was the first blow to his happiness. 
* His best friend passed away from cancer and he no longer has a best friend that is ""his mirror"". 
* Got Lasik eye surgery in January 2024 and has major complications since (pain, poor/unstable vision, major halos/double vision, poor night vision). No glasses or contacts will solve these issues. He had really bad vision before (-9.5) and thought this would take something off his plate, make his life easier and allow him to get up at night and care for a kid.
   * This has caused him to blame himself for not seeing red flags, for doing something ""risky"", and feels like he's sabotaging himself. 
   * **This is a big root of his current depression, anxiety and the PTSD. The deep regret that this has cause has really dug such a deep hole.**
   * **A big problem is he draws a direct line between happiness and his vision, and his vision will never go back to how it was so he has determined there's no reason to try/live.**
* He's currently seeing a psychiatrist and is on a ""cocktail"" of medications that were doing pretty well to stabilize his mood enough to not have extreme breakdowns but still will have crying spells or unable to get out of bed. *However, this week he's been having a spell multiple times a day, every day.*
* Tried a PHP program but found it to be too basic and not focused enough on how to help him specifically. 
* Has a talk therapist, and is trying a new PTSD focused person. And is also interested in trying EMDR or ART therapy. 
* Has admitted that he doesnt know how to help himself and not sure if he wants to help himself.
* Will sit and cry on the couch or in bed for hours unable to control his mood, *severe melancholy.* 

  
I have some feelings of my own about everything -- i think he is waiting for a cure all, magic something that will take away all of the pain or bring back his vision. He gets caught up trying to ""prove"" to people that he's so sad, or so unable to get better and often saying ""no one understands"" like he's waiting for their approval to give up. 

  
I guess, all of this is to ask for **help from a concerned and sad spouse.** It's getting increasingly hard for me to know what to do for him, or how to help him. I'm finding myself to be sad and having depressing moments more often, but *i will make it clear that i'm not going to leave him*. I am willing to try any and everything to keep him on this earth and to find him relief. I'm also starting to lose hope, which i think is the scariest part for me.

And when I am pooping in toilet i always feel like something sharpy will come out from the toilet hole and tear my body whole body by entering through my butthole and so much more which are very disturbing and irritating for me . I don't know if these thoughts are normal .

 I feel like I have made a lifelong mistake by watching those movies which impacted a part of my brain when it was developing . I don't know what to do . Also I feel like this is due to ocd I have . And nowadays my thoughts are related to my parents where i criticize them and having feelings like they are not my parents  even though they are my parents . I think i don't love them , I am just using them , I have never achieved anything in my life despite them wasting so much time and money on me .

 What am I becoming and now I am realising I was just wasting my all fucking time in mobile phone since 4 years since lockdown watching things like philosophy , deep psychology , astrology , hand writing analysis only to use this knowledge to use it to compare people with myself like I have a theory that I have developed from using the information I gained from internet like people born in November and January  are more likely to be born leaders and be special around all people . They are the most creative and most strong minded people . Also most great people are born in these months . And there are many things similar to this .

 I just don't know where i wasted my teenage time on on these bullshit things . I never watched any movie nor series . I didnot did anything fully . I just wasted all my time thinking about all these things or searching things related to these things on internet . Now I feel the effect these caused in me . All the time I am thinking about all these bullshit getting to know people date birth only to compare myself to them . In this search of these things I have completely lost my innocence in me . There is no child left inside me when something bad happens around me I feel very frustrated and catching it instantly unlike other people who can't even figure something bad happened and even if they catch they just forget it and laugh on it unlike me .

 Also I am too overly competative too much much more greater then Ronaldo has ever been you just don't know how I catch every information of you and figure out how special are you because I want to be special I want to be those 1% people who have the best genetics and are the most cheerful people who are famous among people and people follow them .

We grew apart during that time but have recently reconnected. He’s one of my best friends. I love him so much. When he looks at me it’s all I can do not to kiss him. What do I do now?? I already had to go through him liking someone else and it took a humongous toll on my mental health. Seeing him like that made me physically sick. I was never happy. 
This is all surprising to me because he had been acting really flirty lately. What should I do?? How can I remain friends with someone while being completely in love with them?

,depression_help,"Just ranting here and would appreciate any supporting words or advice on what I could be doing differently. So I had a feeling that I have not been doing so well at work. I got some feedback that I could improve so I have been trying to improve on some fronts but seems like my project has been sabotaged with requirements changing and the whole project going back to the beginning. And I just started implementing what went through the design review. So I can sense that I'm being gaslighted, people around me asking some simple questions and some of what I say being repeated back to me. This has been happening for about 2-3 weeks and I thought perhaps it was coincidence but today it became clear that it was not. 

Since I've had performance issues in my previous jobs, it's gotten me to question whether I'm good enough to make it in this field and whether I'll ever be able to succeed as I used to years ago. 

Anyhow, I can't control what other people do but I can control how I react. So I am going to try to work hard and make progress on the project even though I'm having issues. So at least they'll have to prove that I'm not working well, i.e. my performance is not up to the company's standard. 

Another option that I'm consider is to take FMLA for 1-2 months. This will have some financial impact but it'll give me time to get better and start interviewing to try to find the next job.

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I can&amp;#39;t control what other people do but I can control how I react. So I am going to try to work hard and make progress on the project even though I&amp;#39;m having issues. So at least they&amp;#39;ll have to prove that I&amp;#39;m not working well, i.e. my performance is not up to the company&amp;#39;s standard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option that I&amp;#39;m consider is to take FMLA for 1-2 months. This will have some financial impact but it&amp;#39;ll give me time to get better and start interviewing to try to find the next job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thank you for reading and any support and advice would be greatly appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

I’m in my third year of uni, and every term, after a few weeks I start to become really depressed and suicidal. It started out a month or so into uni, but ever since it has started earlier and earlier. I haven’t even had my second lecture yet and it has already started. I’ve done everything I’m supposed to do, I’ve joined loads of societies, I’ve started going to therapy and I quit all of my bad coping mechanisms but it is still coming back and it gets worse each time. I don’t think I can do it again, I can’t stand another term of wanting to die everyday and being so depressed I can’t do anything  and trying to starve myself just to have something that I care about that I can work towards. The only thing that has ever helped is self harm but I know it doesn’t help in the long run and I have stopped and I don’t even want even a little bit to start again but there is just nothing else I know that can help me, it is the only thing that has ever been consistently there for me, nothing else ever helps. I don’t want to kill myself because I want things to get better, I really do, but I am starting to lose hope that that could ever happen, because I’m doing what I’m supposed to and no matter how good things get it always just comes back to this and it’s just so awful I don’t know if the good out ways the bad. Of course, since I am back at uni I am living alone again, so if anything happened, no one would even know and it would be days or weeks before anyone even noticed. And when I’m  by myself I have no one to distract me, because the expression gets so I lose interest in everything so I can’t distract myself. That’s why I’m so scared to be alone, but what else can I do? I don’t really have friends, maybe a couple, but they sure as shit aren’t gonna want me hanging around them all the time because they actually have lives.

For the start I'm a 23 year old male and I'm that guy that was always a fat kid around. I was fat all elementary and high school. After this many years of being like that self hatred and self doubt has built up in me so much that I was walking corpse till I got to uni. In uni and after a COVID my mental state declined to the point of attempted suicide, for my luck I can be rational and I stopped myself right before jumping.

Somehow I prevailed and completed the semester with support of my family like all those years they still try to help me. Second semester of my second year I somehow I don't know how got together with a girl. She was awesome, kind, lovely, we had a lot of hobbies in common for the first time in my life I felt happy. But how it is with every metal issues they will not go away with the swing of the magic wand
And there comes the first problem in our relationship long story short condom torn etc.. ofc we had plan B, bud on next day it hit me like a train. What if she is pregnant what next what to do . Burden hit me hard and I just crumbled and started crying like a bitch and I was like that for a while till we got a negative test. Thanks to god she wasn't pregnant. Long story short she broke up with me shortly after. And that didn't go well with me I went to sorrows crying, begging everything you can imagine. I was a pathetic excuse for a man then. This was the next two weeks of my life. After two weeks I went to my the friend and told him to give me some exercise plan or I will kill myself. I don't know what came thru me that day, but it saved my life. From that day I started with my healing and becoming better. In the next 4 months I lost around 25 kg after that I came back to next semester I was happy I was still fat but not that fat at least. I was just happy for nothing, first time in my life. I started to go to a party and have fun I was still seeing my now ex but I still couldn't look in her eyes BC I know that everything was my fault but at least I'm happy no ?
Fast forward 2 years I'm still exercising, having fun I thought that I am becoming better, that I'm better. But in those 2 years I didn't lose even 1 kg still the same 100 kg(179cm) for two years, I didn't have any relationship not even a date or kiss still afraid to talk to girls, still hurting when I see her happy with somebody new. And after the time I spent with friends having fun I realised that they all have something unique, some talent or feature that makes them interesting and me nothing I have nothing. After everything I did after how I tried I'm still the same fat loser who can't talk to girls, is not interesting, has nothing to show, with such a low self-esteem that I began to think that I'm not man enough to have a girl, porn destroyed me in a sense that I'm afraid that I will not be able to satisfy a girl.

I’m a 19-year-old who recently dropped out of university with only a high school diploma and no real work experience. I dropped out because I was struggling to cope with the pressures of university and my mental health.

The thing is, I have no clue what I want, what I like, or even what I don’t like. It feels like I’m stuck in this state of uncertainty, not knowing where to go or what to do. I don’t really have any plans, and it’s hard to imagine one when I don’t even know who I am or what I’m aiming for. It's like I don't even know myself anymore.

I want to do something with myself, to find a path, but I keep questioning whether I’ve made or am making the right decisions. It always seems like I made the wrong decision, after everything went down. And it always makes me feel really bad, like why didn't I do this or that...

Today, I was selected to participate in the 9th grade prom for a performance. It all went horribly wrong. A girl approached me and asked what I was doing and if I wanted to join the prom. She insisted, and to avoid making her feel bad in front of everyone, I said yes. She introduced me to her friends, and they said I was perfect for the role since I’m tall.

Just before my last class, I was told to come prepare for the performance. I learned that others had been practicing a dance, and I was supposed to be partnered with a girl. I didn’t know what they were planning, but I was happy to participate. I had a nice suit to wear, and I was excited.

However, when I introduced myself to my partner, she told me to ""Please leave the prom."" I felt heartbroken—not because I liked her, but because I just wanted to have fun. I refused to let anyone ruin that for me, so I stayed.

During practice, I watched once, then it was my turn. I had to walk like a model alongside the girl, and I was told to smile. When I did, everyone laughed at me and said I wasn’t good enough. Feeling really sad, I just left and went home.

&lt;p&gt;During practice, I watched once, then it was my turn. I had to walk like a model alongside the girl, and I was told to smile. When I did, everyone laughed at me and said I wasn’t good enough. Feeling really sad, I just left and went home.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"#**TLDR AT THE BOTTOM**

----------------------------

Apologies for the awkward title. I didn't know how to present my post, but I've recently come to something of a realization that's half blindsiding, half revelation.

I'm 32 and have battled depression for most of my life since at least ~15. Fortunately it's been mild to moderate, but in 2011-2012 things got worse until I ""bottomed out"" and admitted to my mom who asked me to go for a walk with her to the store - which never happened before or since - and I told her I was suicidal. My initial attempt with a therapist being a joke aside, I found a decent one not long after, got medicated and proceeded to have the best mental health year of my life. This lasted until I got a job that reminded my brain it's not supposed to be normal and I've been re-broken since. Medicated once or twice over the years but yeah.

Fast forward to today, and 2021 was the worst year of my life bar none, but some trauma and grief issues aside I honestly came out the other side a lot less destroyed than you'd expect. Now for the past year-ish I've been on a deceptive decline. I'd get worse in short order but bounce back, then down, back up, etc. but little did I realize the bounce up was a little lower each time, so things were getting worse. Then came the summer and joblessness again. The freedom is lovely but the self-imposed hermitage a bit less so. With nothing to make me go out, I don't, not really. I have fewer ups and downs which is good in a way, but not really because now it's all down. 

I have ADHD as well, and I think that partly keeps me from thinking about my issues. I'm like doubly prone to compartmentalization and selective blindness and unawareness to my problems because I don't want to deal with or acknowledge them. But it still crosses my mind in brief snippets throughout the day. 

So a few days ago the following thought arrived: ""All this time you were so diligently keeping watch for the way you were in 2012, and you never once stopped to consider something oh so crucial - the game may be the same but the rules have changed. You've been going down a dark road for so long and you didn't even realize it because the street name didn't match your maps."" 

Intense depression for me today looks like low energy, disgustingly low motivation, an apparent willingness to set records for how long a man can go without showering as long as he doesn't really stink, Heinz 57 Varieties of Sad, and a sort of empty-but-loud-mindedness - a different channel of static than before. There have been so many little chances to realize I was going down, and yet I just didn't. Being unable to gather the will to try to find a therapist again to help save me after the last few fell through for one reason or another almost was the one. Almost.

-------------------------------

**TL;DR - The game is the same but the rules can change. What qualifies as ""Severe Depression"" symptoms for me at 32 is different from what it was when I was 20. It sounds so stupid in hindsight, and I certainly feel like an idiot but goddammit it doesn't matter and now I'm finally realizing I'm here. But idk how to get the will to get out. So for the love of all the gods real or imaginary, if you've been battling for anywhere near as long as I have, be on the lookout for this. If the rules could change for me, they can change for you too.**

,depression_help,"TL; DR: Had a soft(?) mental breakdown &amp; quit my job without another lined up. The low intensity jobs I applied for aren’t responding, the higher intensity ones are. I fear I’m gonna flop again. I feel lost as a person and in my career. 

Hi all. 

I’m at a loss. Finished my first year of teaching last year and things went well. I love the kids. The school leadership is bad though so I said ok this next year will be my last.

I applied for other jobs over the summer…bc…idk…I guess just in case?

Anyway a month before the school year starts my grandma gets sick. This sends me into a relapse of horrible depression  (ive been diagnosed for about a decade). Going between sleeping all day, then staying up all night and feeling deprived and paranoid, having trouble speaking, giving up on preparing for anything, not eating, just emptiness. Doing what I have to do for my pets. Crying every day…

Back to school PD starts and I’m like. I’m going fucking crazy. I will literally fucking die. 

So I quit hoping to maybe someday recover and return (like years later if things seem better.)

So I’m applying for jobs but the lower interaction jobs aren’t calling me back. I apply for more demanding jobs in education related fields, nervous to do so.

I got an interview with one of them this week and I’m scared shitless. I want insurance so I can go on meds again (I did Deep TMS last year after trying 5 failed meds and I guess it wore off) and try to gain control of my life. Currently my therapy is paused bc no income. EDIT: I have savings enough for a few months.

My old supervisor just reached out asking how I’m doing &amp; when I’m coming back. Bad. Idek. I don’t want to return to the classroom for a while since my emotions are so volatile atm.

I’m not really suicidal I just can’t quiet the negative thoughts  and every little thing makes me cry for a while. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m scared of getting the new job and fucking that up too. I’m scared of not being able to get another job besides that one. With a lower intensity job at least I could think about going back to school ti maybe another career path and doing things slowly. but I have to get the job first….

I’m just freaking out. Feels like 50 different problems and I caused them all.

&lt;p&gt;Hi all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m at a loss. Finished my first year of teaching last year and things went well. I love the kids. The school leadership is bad though so I said ok this next year will be my last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied for other jobs over the summer…bc…idk…I guess just in case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway a month before the school year starts my grandma gets sick. This sends me into a relapse of horrible depression  (ive been diagnosed for about a decade). Going between sleeping all day, then staying up all night and feeling deprived and paranoid, having trouble speaking, giving up on preparing for anything, not eating, just emptiness. Doing what I have to do for my pets. Crying every day…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to school PD starts and I’m like. I’m going fucking crazy. I will literally fucking die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I quit hoping to maybe someday recover and return (like years later if things seem better.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m applying for jobs but the lower interaction jobs aren’t calling me back. I apply for more demanding jobs in education related fields, nervous to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got an interview with one of them this week and I’m scared shitless. I want insurance so I can go on meds again (I did Deep TMS last year after trying 5 failed meds and I guess it wore off) and try to gain control of my life. Currently my therapy is paused bc no income. EDIT: I have savings enough for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My old supervisor just reached out asking how I’m doing &amp;amp; when I’m coming back. Bad. Idek. I don’t want to return to the classroom for a while since my emotions are so volatile atm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not really suicidal I just can’t quiet the negative thoughts  and every little thing makes me cry for a while. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don’t know what to do. I’m scared of getting the new job and fucking that up too. I’m scared of not being able to get another job besides that one. With a lower intensity job at least I could think about going back to school ti maybe another career path and doing things slowly. but I have to get the job first….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just freaking out. Feels like 50 different problems and I caused them all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL; DR: Had a soft(?) mental breakdown &amp;amp; quit my job without another lined up. The low intensity jobs I applied for aren’t responding, the higher intensity ones are. I fear I’m gonna flop again. I feel lost as a person and in my career. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"TW - suicide

I have been diagnosed with a variety of depression disorders for many years. Two and a half years ago, I had a mental breakdown. I felt like my mind literally broke. I couldn't handle anything. I took leave from work and was preparing to go back after two months. Although I told my Dr and everyone else I was fine, feeling better, ready to go, I wasn't. I had stopped taking all my medications, including my insulin. I didn't care what I ate or drank. I met with my Dr to get a return to work plan ready. I wasn't feeling well and she could tell. I told her I felt like I was catching a cold. 

Over the next several days, I got progressively worse. Couldn't keep anything down, eventually got to the point where even getting up to go to the restroom was a chore. I talk to my parents every weekend because we don't live in the same state. I texted my mom and told her I wasn't feeling good, that I would call my dad the next day, and that I probably needed to go to the ER. I never made it. Shortly after that text, I fell unconscious in my home after going into diabetic ketoacidosis.  I live alone, so no one knew. My mom called and texted me constantly. After getting no response for two days, she called for a welfare check. The police found me and I was rushed to the hospital in extremely critical condition. They called my mom and let her know where I was. She flew in the next day. At the hospital, everyone told her to prepare to say goodbye as I was not expected to survive. 

I survived. I was kept heavily sedated for seven days, in ICU for 10, in step down ICU for another seven, regular hospital for two weeks, and rehab for two months. When I fell, I fell on something that caused a horrific injury to my leg and foot. I had three emergency surgeries to save them, and one repair surgery to fix the resulting damage. I had home health care for five months. Out patient physical therapy for a year. I wasn't allowed to walk for almost a year. Not allowed to drive for over a year. But I survived. I'm here. I have so much to be thankful for. And I am. But I struggle with survivors guilt. And it's affecting my job. I was put on a PIP last week. 

The job I have today is not the same job I had then. I left for a better opportunity. But I kept in touch with one of my former bosses. He was such a great guy. I always looked forward to our chats. He was my sports buddy. Because, as a female, I didn't have many friends I could talk sports with. He had his own issues. I knew some. Some I found out later. Unfortunately, his issues became monsters and he lost his job. I didn't know. He didn't tell me. Eight weeks later, he committed suicide. It's been about 3.5 months. I am constantly thinking about what signs I missed. What I could have said differently.  What I could have done differently. But the survivors guilt is slowly killing me. 

Why am I here. Why was I saved. Why isn't my friend here. Why wasn't he saved.  

I'm in therapy. I'm on antidepressants. I'm doing all the things. I don't feel better. Every day I feel a little worse. I don't know how to cope. I don't have any coping skills. And now my job is on the line. 

My therapist recommended EMDR to deal with previous issues and PTSD, before trying to tackle the guilt and PTSD from his suicide. What can I expect from this therapy? Does it work? I know it's still pretty controversial, but I need help. Would appreciate any advice or guidance. Thanks.

,depression_help,"hello, I (23F) have recently been struggling with depression. In the past I have complained that between work and grad school that I do not have any free time. Both loads have become lighter within the last few month and I have more free time than I am used to. The thing is, I can't seem to find any hobby or activity that I can do that excites me.

  
I do enjoy watching certain shows but laying around and watching TV makes me feel lazy.

How do I even qualify all of it? How do I… how do I… 

How do I come to grips with losing them, and dealing with my bpd on nights like this is just… Jesus. 

I’m no stranger to wanting to give up, and GOD how I’ve tried. Jesus fucking Christ. 

According to the er doc, it came down to less than 2 minutes. I was legally dead when I got to the hospital, and yet I’m here, again. With no effects minus more or less an erased memory prior to the od on my lamictal. 

What more do I have to do? Why am I even still here? Over 70 overdoses, cutting since I was a teen. 

It seems like millions of different combos of meds, therapy. Everything. Psych visits. Ward visits. 

Maybe being put down is the answer. It seems cruel, but answer me this. Ready? 

When nothing else is working, why demand or beg someone to live in a world they can’t anymore? Or really couldn’t for 20 years. Why ask them to continue going through that pain, and agony, just so YOU can say you did something to make YOU feel better? 

We are all strangers here. No one really KNOWS that pain. Everyone is actually different. 

So why fight against people wanting to be euthanized? Why not let them just… go? They will feel better, finally. And honestly, those that love them will see they are FINALLY at peace. 

And that’s what I want. Peace. 

At this point, I can’t end it. I’ve tried. So many times. But I won’t die. I’m afraid to now, honestly. Just another tube, more tears and promises.

,depression_help,"I (29m) have dealt with depression on and off for the majority of my life. Outwardly, I would mostly seem to have it all together. I own a home, have a dog who I care deeply for, have a reasonably supportive family and friends, make good money at a solid career, am at least average looking, exercise regulary, and am fairly intelligent and with decent social skills. Despite all of this, I still feel disconnected from everyone around me and the world as a whole.
Beginning in my teenage years, I have developed a sense that no one else quite ""gets"" me. My therapist who i have visited for better than 2 years now weekly, attributes this to me having a particularly high IQ.

I dont say any of this with the intention of humble bragging, but rather to accentuate the issue. I don't feel like I'm getting enough out of life. About 6 months ago, I went through a breakup with my long term SO, which did not cause my depression but rather aggravated it to the point where now life feels like it isn't worth living. I truly don't believe that she was ""the one"" but that having someone in my daily life who cared enough to stick around was good enough.

Since then, I have been emotionally volatile, feel chronically low on energy, am acutely sensitive to negative stimuli, have increasingly large amounts of negative self talk and SI, and more than anything else, am lonelier than ever before. My hobbies just feel like escapism rather than a solution. My productivity at work is much worse, and it feels like an enormous amount of effort to perform the upkeep that comes with owning a home and pet. I manage to perform all the necessary steps most days but everything feels like I am just checking a box, but not actually getting any fulfillment or making progress in any way. 

I believe i have tried to get better. As I mentioned earlier, I attend therapy weekly. I have made lifestyle changes by eating healthier, given up smoking weed which I used as a crutch for years, cut back my drinking to 2 days a week or less, stayed active, made plans with friends, attempted to maintain a positive mindset when possible, and have spent hours reading philosophy and self help material to try to obtain the missing piece that I am hoping will turn things around.

Thus far the only clear avenues I have not pursued are medication (which did not help me during college when I was in a similar situation) and getting involved with more regular group activities. I don't know how much longer I can keep putting in the effort and not feeling like I am getting what I need in return. I am usually thankful for what I have, but when I start feeling poorly, those emotions feel all consuming and drown out any sense of appreciation. Mindfulness exercises only provide fleeting relief and then the darkness comes flooding back in. I am desperately afraid of making an irreversible mistake and devastating those around me.

Outwardly, I would mostly seem to have it all together. I own a home, have a dog who I care deeply for, have a reasonably supportive family and friends, make good money at a solid career, am at least average looking, exercise regulary, and am fairly intelligent and with decent social skills. Despite all of this, I still feel disconnected from everyone around me and the world as a whole.
Beginning in my teenage years, I have developed a sense that no one else quite &amp;quot;gets&amp;quot; me. My therapist who i have visited for better than 2 years now weekly, attributes this to me having a particularly high IQ.&lt;/p&gt;

I constantly feel tired and like I have no energy and I have zero motivation to do anything and I’m either overeating or barely eating and have no appetite. I have trouble falling asleep and then when I wake up I’m always fighting to stay awake and groggy. I’ve never been a big morning person but it seems worse lately. I’m usually very energetic and full of smiles but lately I feel like every little thing annoys me and puts me in a bad mood. Nothing in my diet has changed that could cause this and I also know that I’m not pregnant and I haven’t been taking any new contraceptives so I don’t think it could be hormonal. I recently saw some videos from a psychologist talking about depression and everything she was talking about seemed to fit into how I have been feeling and acting lately. Im not having any suicidal thoughts or anything but sometimes I catch myself thinking that I wouldn’t mind it if I never woke up in the morning or if a car run me over.

,depression_help,"I can't deal with my life anymore. 

I hate living and depending on my family, my debt eats away at me every day, and my internship doesn't give me enough to pay the monthly loan installments. I'm barely paying off 2 of those ... 

To give some context to my situation:

About 4 years ago, I took out a loan to pay for college, since my father could only (actually didn't want to) pay for half of my semesters, and the other half is with the student loan. 

However, as soon as I graduated, I had to start paying my loan in monthly installments. The problem is that my first and only formal job I have is as an intern at a consulting firm, and interns in my country get paid very little. 

I don't know what to do, I'm desperate, I feel like a failure, I've already sent my CV to more than 30-40 jobs, and I haven't received any positive response. I have a decent academic background, I studied at a somewhat recognized institution here, I have certificates in other areas, I have a good level of English (I'm a Spanish speaker), but no one hires me. 

In a couple of weeks, I'll be 4 months into the company.  I tried to talk to one of my bosses about hiring me, about being able to work full time and with at least a minimum salary. But he said he couldn't promise me anything for at least the next 2-3 months, which is the length of my internship contract. And that has been discouraging me ever since. 

In about 2-3 weeks, it will be the last money I have saved to pay the next installment. After that I don't know what I'll do, I'll have to sell my stuff, my mother is also unemployed and can't help me, she doesn't live with me. I live with my grandmother for study reasons (I don't have that much emotional connection with her either, so that's not an option either). My father is the guarantor of my loan, and if I stop paying, the credit bureau affects him and they can take away his assets, but despite that, he doesn't care about my situation, we haven't talked in weeks, he hasn't even asked me how I'm doing with all this.

I don't know what to do, I've seriously thought about ending my misery. 

The only thing that motivates me to stay awake is my current partner, she's the only support I have, but only emotionally, that's all. She's still studying her career. I don't want to drag her down with all this, but I feel miserable, I can't go on dates with her, I can't buy her anything, I can't bring her food, I was barely able to buy her some flowers a few weeks ago, since all the money I get I have to save for my payments. I feel so bad, she is the woman of my life, and her love and support is so unconditional that I don't deserve it, she is extraordinary, she doesn't deserve a loser without a job, without his independence, without stability, with depression, without the will to live.

I don&amp;#39;t want to drag her down with all this, but I feel miserable, I can&amp;#39;t go on dates with her, I can&amp;#39;t buy her anything, I can&amp;#39;t bring her food, I was barely able to buy her some flowers a few weeks ago, since all the money I get I have to save for my payments. I feel so bad, she is the woman of my life, and her love and support is so unconditional that I don&amp;#39;t deserve it, she is extraordinary, she doesn&amp;#39;t deserve a loser without a job, without his independence, without stability, with depression, without the will to live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honey, I love you so much.
Forgive me for not treating you the way you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"[Discussion] I HATE the journey, I HATE the learning process, I HATE the activity in general, I only want the end goal.

I HATE the process, i hate the journey, i ONLY want the end goal.

Im 28 and just unable to enjoy anything. I only ever seem to want the end goal, but DESPISE the process to get there. I hate improvement, learning, and overcoming obstacles. I just wsnt the end result.
I tried exercising and getting into a routine aince the pandemic, but instead ive lost muscle and gained a lot of weight I cant do any form if hobby or skill without hating myself and hating the process. I always hated the ""journey"" to getting better and only care about the end result. I have never seen it any other way all my life. And as you have probably guessed, with instruments, sports, drawing and even competitive games, i have never found any success or improvement to the point where i quit and was heartbroken... many many times.
I hate exercise, but i want muscle and to lose weight. I dont even enjoy watching tv series, i just want to complete them. I dont enjoy playing games anymore, i just want to complete them, take them off my backlog and go to the next. I hate drawing, but i want to make any picture i want, i hate learning instruments but still want to play any song...

This is my life. Therapy didnt do shit...
Over the last many many years... ive had 12 therapists, multiple group therapies i got banned from, multiple mental health servers i got banned from, i lost many friends who i vented to almost daily, i had a 1000$ dollar evaluation just to tell me i had anxiety and autism. I got sent to the ER and they laugjed at me booted me out after a few hours and i got another 1000$ bill. I dont think you realize how hopeless this is...

Edit:sorry if my thoughts are all over the place... i just really needed to get this all down.

Trouble is, I’m very very suicidal. Every single day I think about dying, how I’d do it, when, etc. I’ve been to a mental hospital 10+ times in the last 5 years, all they do is just tell me to see my doctor and give me a list of hotlines. They don’t help.

I’ve recently gotten out of a long-ass abusive relationship/friendship but they were my only emotional connection and I feel really raw about it. So things were already shitty and now they’re even worse.

No, I don’t work or attend school either. Work seems impossible because my anxiety gets so bad that I will black out. School may be happening but I’m afraid I’ll have to leave due to anxiety… I was supposed to start college 4 years ago but life had other plans :/

I already know my parents will be very disappointed and angry at me for not making A’s. But this year has been a big struggle for me. I just dont want to deal with this.

,depression_help,"Can you resist a depressive episode?

About one or two weeks ago, i started feeling much better, feeling hopeful, motivated, i got really active, had a pretty good sleep schedule. I’ve had small periods where things got better before but i don’t remeber feeling so joyous and hopeful, I don’t know how, it just… happened, on its own, like something had switched in my brain, and i genuinely thought things were starting to take a big turn for me, for a week i felt like a healthy person. 
About 3 days ago i caught a cold which sort of broke my momentum. I thought ""i’m proud of the week i just had, i’ll just rest for 2-3 days, until the sickness goes away and then pick up where i left"" I was still feeling motivated to keep going as soon as my cold went away but today, it’s like i woke up fine and my state deteriorated through the day and i’m about to go to bed feeling like i have for the past 4-5 years. Really melancholic, moody, tired, i can feel that weird empty feeling in my chest and the weight of the rumination in my head.

I’m scared that this was all just another false hope, i’m scared of losing this power i had over my life, of losing motivation and hope of not being able to act on them, of having to wait another how many months for another chance.

I've been living in New Brunswick for years, and I absolutely hate this place. I have yet to meet one person here that I can call a friend. I have yet to meet a woman to go on a date with. 

I don't drink alcohol that much, so going to the bar surrounded by drunk people doesn't appeal to me. But so far, it's the only thing I haven't done to meet women. 

Whats the point of dating apps? They are absolutely USLESS! I've been using three different apps for years, I've gotten a handful of matches that were either fake accounts or just immediate ghosting. 

People want to talk highly about Men's mental health, but they DONT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT! I believe I had my first panic attack yesterday! Granted, it was minor, but what's that change? Still happened.

I recently met a woman over one of the dating apps. Total catfish situation, her profile said she was 24, and she was physically attractive. I meet her, she's like 40 to 50 pounds heavier, and she mentions to me that she's 19?!?
I felt fucking sick to my stomach! It was a horrible experience through and through. 

I've been mentally fucked since. And that's without mentioning the years of depression and PTSD AND EXISTENTIAL CRISIS!.
Where are the people out here that care?
Probably In some crack house tripping balls cause there is a SERIOUS drug problem in this province. And the Federal Government? All their focus on is ""we need to ban flavored vapes, they appeal to the younger generation.""

I'm not a good person. I've had a rough life and I think that's really messed me up.

,depression_help,"Hi 
I'm 18yo male.

For the background. I'm not ""fit"" but I'm not fat. Actually skinny. Not the prettiest guy out there.
But I do look good maybe 5/10. Not more that that. I take care of myself. 




A while ago i lost contact with many of my friends.
I barely leave the house. 
I feel empty, and sad often. 

Spend most of my time watching tv shows, and playing games. 

It wasn't like that always. 
I had a good social life, was going out with friends 
had fun every day. Didn't play games more than an hour daily. 

But I witnessed something. And I think it changed me forever. 

It was just a normal Monday at noon. Just coming back home from night out at nearby city. 

I got on a train, few minutes later train started shaking. I thought we just derailed. Cuz it happened week earlier. Didn't think much of it. 

Until ambulances, police and people started showing up. 

That's when I knew something bad had happened. 
Train hit a car. 
Driver and two kids died. 
After few hours sitting in the train. 
We were allowed to get out. 
There was a lot of blood. 

After seeing that I threw up. And since then I can't sleep normally. 

Stopped going out, or even talking if it's not needed. 

Now this part isn't connected to the story from above. 


There's this girl. Let's call her Riley ( not her real name) 

She's year younger than me 10 months exactly. 

So Riley is cute, smart. Doesn't smoke or drink. 
And I'm head over the heels in love with her. 

But she avoids me, tried calling her, texting. 
Nope. 
I didn't call her like thousand times. 
Few times (2-3) sent 4 or 5 texts. 

She read them. And told me to never contact her again. 

All I said was okay. 

But I can't stop thinking about her. And now even when I have to get out of the house. I'm hoping to see her. But at the same time I hope she doesn't see me. 


Recently I had a dream about her. 
Dream that killed me. 

Riley and me, we were together hanging out.
Something like flirting.
And we got into a car. But it was too crowded so she had to sit in my lap. 

But she was texting a lot, and laughing. 
When I asked about it. She just shrugged it off. Like it was nothing. 

After a while, she told me she was texting with her ex. And that she's getting back with him. 

Now I know that it was just a dream.  But it felt too real. 
And it broke me. 

If you have any advice that can help me. Please comment. 

I started considering some options that I don't like.

,depression_help,"I 26f have been dealing with self harm and treatment resistant depression since 10 years old. I also have CPTSD and OCD.

Treatments that I've tried:
-12 years of therapy
-EMDR
-Hypnosis 
-Somatic therapies
-Group therapy
-Inpatient Treatments
-Intensive Outpatient Treatments
-Partial Hospitalization Programs
-20+ psychiatric medications (I had genesight testing done. Only 3 medications were compatible and I've tried them too.)
-Telemagnetic Stimulation Therapy (TMS) Neurostar
-Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) Bilateral for 1+ years. Probably between 60-70 treatments 
-Mushrooms (carefully picked strains) microdosed 0.1-0.5g every 2-3 days and trips 1.5-5g 

I have a hx of one suicide attempt in May of this year.

I also suffer from a multitude of chronic illnesses. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia (IST), Endometriosis, Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, Asthma, Factor IV Lieden (blood clotting disorder inactive only have 1st allele), and Interstitial Cystitis (IC).

I get terrible symptoms daily not only chronic pain but also presyncope, syncope, and adrenaline dumps. Plus a multitude of other random but somehow connected symptoms.

I spend my days just managing symptoms mental and physical. 

The only thing that ever gave me mental health relief was ECT. It took my depression from an 11 to a 0. Unfortunately I had to stop after a year due to insurance and increasingly alarming side effects. I now have terrible short term memory loss, I can't retain information I try to learn, brain fog, loss of concentration, and for lack of a better description a loss of my common sense. I am still experiencing these symptoms a year after stopping treatments.

I am at a loss for what to do next. I have considered ketamine infusions, nasal spray, or oral microdosing but I am worried about the cardiac effects. I am currently still microdosing mushrooms but if I do a full trip I have to be very careful to monitor my vitals and keep myself stable.

At this point I have looked into assisted death/suicide. 

Most doctors have deemed me a lost cause. My last therapist of 3-4 years dumped me bc she felt like she was taking my money without providing progress. My psychiatrist got increasingly annoyed and agitated over the years that I had not made progress and my PHQ-9 and GAD-7 have stayed consistently the same pretty much my whole life other than during the year of ECT. 

I implemented all the tools and coping skills and even tracked my use and how I felt they worked for my doctors.

I am on the hunt for a new psychiatrist and second opinion (more like 5th). Until then I'm hoping someone can share something I haven't tried or heard of.

,depression_help,"I'm 30 years old . I dont have guts and I'm afraid to speak my mind.  It's been like this for so long, but it wasn't always. The nail in the coffin was getting a massive and extremely visible tattoo that I don't even like because I was afraid of looking like an idiot (which makes no fucking sense).. I even remember thinking before getting the tattoo that I've got to speak up, I'm going to feel this way forever, but I just ignored it and now I can't get over this tattoo and I'm spiraling.

The tattoo is 2 months old and I'm seriously thinking of getting laser. It was such a dumb time to get a tattoo and I genuinely feel like I'll never bounce back again and I'm so afraid.

I've always struggled with self compassion but this time it's really fucking me up. People are even saying they can see a visible change in the way I look, I'm smoking almost a pack a day, like what the actual fuck.

,depression_help,"Last summer, just after I (22F) turned 21, my intestines ruptured. I had to have emergency surgery to not die, since I was pretty much on death's doorstep that day. For months after my surgery I was uncomfortably aware of how close to dying I was, and it scared me. It's been over a year now and I've recovered nicely, and I don't think about it as much.

But over said year, I've had so many things go wrong in my life like breakups, deaths, and just everything awful that can happen is happening. I'm on antidepressants but I often still find myself thinking that I should have died during my surgery or in the hospital because this past year has been hell and I can't do it anymore.

I just had a death in my family a few weeks ago and I've been extremely depressed since then and my mind keeps wandering back to the same thought: I should have died, then I wouldn't have to deal with this. I don't necessarily want to die, I just want the pain to go away because it's unbearable. It would have been easier if I just died.

To clarify, I've been having these thoughts for months, not just since my recent family death, although it is what's caused my current depression.

So i have taken literally every SSRI, SMS, NDRI, SARI, and depression focused mood stabilizer available to me. Like I went through the FDA list of of all of them available to me in my country that aren't discontinued. I have tried literally every one of them for extended amounts of time. I didn't realize until today that I have attempted every single one of them.

I can't take MAOIs or SNRIs, The former because I take ADHD medication, the latter because I have had severe simutainiously depression/anxiety worsening and chemically toxic responses to four of them in ways we had to cold turkey pull me off them.

What do I do now. What do I even do now. Is there anything I can do now? 

I mean I already go to therapy and the therapy definitely helps but also I am having borderline daily suicidal ideations thoughts, hopelessness, purposelessness, zero motivation or drive, body heaviness, the whole shabang. 

What do i do. (Other than continuing therapy which is great supplemental but i know i need more).

I've had to take a big step back in our relationship so I don't bother him. he gets irritated easily. I have been keeping to myself, and focusing on the house and kids to make up for the fact that he supports us, and don't ask for anything. 

I listen to him and ask about his day. he doesn't ask about me. if he notices I'm sad he tells me to get over it. it's been hard to share the same spaces. I feel embarrassed and ashamed. 

I know he's stressed out too- so I do my best to take the load off. it's not enough. the kids are older (14, 18, 20). I talk to them about helping me out (please put things back, clean up your mess, etc) but it doesn't stick. 18 takes everything personally, and will get upset. they complain about everything. they say they can't do things because they're in too much pain. the doctors can't find anything wrong. it comes and goes it seems.

I haven't worked for almost 2 years. I had a crisis, and put myself in the hospital. tried to work after that, but couldn't. I've developed a neurological disorder- my body moves funny in ways I can't control. It won't get better. I am applying for disability. its not fast.

I have medicine to help. it helps some. my partner agreed I shouldn't work. he promised me we'd be ok on his income. I have an Etsy shop. things can be hard. I think he resents me now.

I don't have any close friends. my family knows about my condition, but since the medicine helps, they forget. everything hurts, but my heart hurts the most.

my therapist asked: *do you like yourself?*

I do. I didn't always. but I really do. I don't think my family does, and certainly not my partner. I don't sleep much, and I've lost so much weight you can see my ribs. no one else knows this since I wear baggy clothes.

I want to go away. I'm so, so sad. I finally slept about 18 hours. I'm considering making myself go back to sleep so I don't have to be awake in this sadness.

I’m female, legal in age (not a minor), yet I am malnourished. I’ve had depression for a long time, and I haven’t grown since the age of 11. I believe my depression contributed to my malnourishment because I never put much concern into eating (and mostly eating just junk)

Some people are unable to escape poverty because they are depressed, and being on poor makes them even more depressed, because they can barely afford the basics needs in life. They are unable to have any hobbies where they can connect with people, making their situation even worse. When you are not connected with people, you forget how to have conversations.

You start to fear about your future, and see no hope, because problems seem to pile up.

,depression_help,"Has anyone had really bad panic attacks at night? I am starting to feel like a zombie and this has been affecting my relationships. My lack of sleep is causing me to create distance from everyone. I don't normally feel like this. Usually I am okay. When someone isn't very reasurring or they seem like they don't want to hang out with me, my mental health spirals. I feel like a bother asking people to hang out because I really need it after they said they are busy. Even with my long distance partner.. the slightest thing makes me withdrawl and feel disconnected. I feel like the worst partner ever right now. He could make a joke about something we fought about and it feels like we are standing in a long hallway and my body is getting thrown backwards away from him and there is lose paper flying everywhere. I normally can handle feeling turned down or little inconveniences dont normally bother me, but damn I dont know what is happening right now. I don't feel okay.

The last 4 days straight I havent gotten nocturnal panic attacks that wake me up multiple times in a night and it feels like I am having a heart attack. Of course no one is up at 4am to help calm me so every night has felt like hell. I am so exhausted and everytime night rolls around, I have started becoming scared to sleep. I will literally try to do anything but sleep to avoid these panic attacks.

I am starting to feel like a zombie and this has been affecting my relationships. My lack of sleep is causing me to create distance from everyone. I don&amp;#39;t normally feel like this. Usually I am okay. When someone isn&amp;#39;t very reasurring or they seem like they don&amp;#39;t want to hang out with me, my mental health spirals. I feel like a bother asking people to hang out because I really need it after they said they are busy. Even with my long distance partner.. the slightest thing makes me withdrawl and feel disconnected. I feel like the worst partner ever right now. He could make a joke about something we fought about and it feels like we are standing in a long hallway and my body is getting thrown backwards away from him and there is lose paper flying everywhere. I normally can handle feeling turned down or little inconveniences dont normally bother me, but damn I dont know what is happening right now. I don&amp;#39;t feel okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 4 days straight I havent gotten nocturnal panic attacks that wake me up multiple times in a night and it feels like I am having a heart attack. Of course no one is up at 4am to help calm me so every night has felt like hell. I am so exhausted and everytime night rolls around, I have started becoming scared to sleep. I will literally try to do anything but sleep to avoid these panic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

 I ruined the life of someone i love.
I Just am as Despicable and i drain the energy of people who are dear to me.


I Always have the Idea that i'm doing my best but i don't know how to not make self centered decision .
Everytime i'm focusing on the task  i have to do , i put the effort in the Bad way.

When faced with the consequence of my actions , i can't Say anything else other than I'm sorry. 
 I'm just an  égoïst.

I'm dumb , desorganised , and can't remember if i actually feel empathy. I keep putting mental charges on them. I keep being a weight.

 I really thought i was someone safe Dependable, and indepent.
 I keep thinking from the bottom of my Heart that i must change
But i keep being self centered 

How do i stop being this awful?
How do i stop hurting my dear one?

I really want to change.

I'm not sure what to do. My friend (E) and this guy (W) have been talking for a while now. A few days ago he asked her if our school counselor is trustworthy.

Later, they were snapping and ge sent a picture with his wrist in frame (i dont think he noticed it was inframe) and there were a few cuts on it. She questioned him and eventually he admitted he has been cutting himself. He believes he deserves it, not sure why. After a few more conversations he admitted and showed her he was starting to write a suicide note. When he sent the picture of it, there was blood on the table, and (again, after a bit if questioning) he had cut himself again.

E wants to help, so she went to her older brother for advice. Her older brother believes that self harm is 'stupid' and told her to tell W to ""man up"" and ""stop being a p****"" E asked me how to tell him that without being harsh, and I said not to.

I've been feeling extremely depressed a lot lately, there's a lot of things going on in my life, I'm having issues with my partner, I'm kind of in the middle of a gender identity crisis even tho I've identified as trans for over 7 years now and I'm in a place where I don't know what's gonna happen with my life when it comes to getting a job, I just have to wait and hope rn. 

Today was a really bad day, I slept all day, didn't have any appetite, and overall just felt kind of trapped? Idk how to describe it, but I felt like my room was way too small and I couldn't think. I was just distracting myself because I was scared of my thoughts, I didn't wanna have a breakdown or at least not have it where my mom and the friend that's staying with us could hear/see me, I didn't wanna worry them too much. 

I had heard a lot that people go for walks when they feel this way to ""clear their head"" and I did believe them, that it helped them, I did not expect that to work for me too, but today I decided to try and to be honest, I thought I would just have a breakdown outside, but I'm actually sitting outside in a park right now, it's nighttime so it's nice and quiet here, it's so peaceful and for some reason. Now I've been outside and walking around for almost 2 hours, I walked around with music for the first 1½ hours or so looking for a spot to sit down so I could think and cry, I found one, took my headphones off and now Im just kind of hopeful? 

Like I genuinely think that me and my partner are gonna work things out and it's gonna be fine. I still don't know what I'm gonna do with my life, but I'm starting to believe that I'm actually important to people again. I don't know if it's actually the walk that helped, but I know I'm definetly gonna try this again.

Anyway I just wanted to tell people that might also not really belive that this shit works, that I thought so too, but right now it helped a lot, so it might help you too. I think it's definetly at least worth trying.

Confrontée a mes problèmes la seule réponse que je trouve a dire c'est "" desolée je peux mieux faire. Sans arrivé a changé.
 Je suis egoïste et je n'arrive pas a répondre.

Je suis idiot , incapable de m'organiser correctement et je laisse la charge mentale au autres personnes qui m'entoure malgré le fait que j'ai conscience et... Que je pense vraiment ressentir de l'empathie.

 J'ai été en désillusion et j'ai promis être une personne indépendante.
J'ai promis d'être une personne de confiance.
 Ça fait des mois que je pense changer et évoluer.
Mais tout est toujours centré de façon égoïste.


Comment on arrête d'être égoïste ?

Comment on arrête de faire mal aux autres par son inaction et sa stupidité ?

Je veux Vraiment changer . J'en ai marre de toujours promettre ça et de ne rien trouvé comme réponse a part un désolé.


Je doute de toute les actions que je fais.
Je n'arrive pas a réfléchir. Ni as bien exécuter bêtement les conseils qu'on me donne.

Tout est éprouvant Tout me paraît dure. Et j'ai toujours cette obsession pour le fait d'être récompenser des que la moindre tâche est faite.

Je suis tellement désespérée que je songe a mettre fin a mes jours. Car  je n'apporte rien a personne. Sauf de la souffrance.

Ou disparaitre et de tout recommencer en disparaissant de tout réseaux. Incapable d'affronter la réalité des choses.

J'ai tellement honte de moi tellement honte ,  de m'être surestimée sur tout ce qui tient de la vie personnelle. De la vie en couple.

Tellement honte de rien voir alors que je suis censée savoir faire ça. Censé savoir gérer ça.

Qu'est ce que je peux faire quand , a cause des échecs et ma nullité, l'entourage a besoin , de vérifier, de s'assurer , et de rattraper la moindre tâche ménagère, le moindre problème administratif empêche de prendre des initiatives pour résoudre des soucis.

I'm in my mid twenties, graduated during covid and just continued to try to live. But life it shit. I'm thankful everyday but it feels like I'm a humongous fuck up and that there's no way out this time. I barely graduated college. Had to put my dreams on hold because of covid. Got into debt moving to another state (I am American) for a job and further schooling, but that didn't work out. Now I'm unemployed after leaving a job due to co-worker harassment that no one believed me about, and am living off my parent's money. I've been working since I could, and frankly before I was technically allowed to, so being so reliant an my family's money sucks. It also sucks that I'm hiding this debt from them. I can't tell them that I'm thousands of dollars in the hole. If you mention movin back, I can't. And they know that. I feel more like a burden to them then the kid the used to be proud of. I know they say words to try to help me but I hear their true feelings deep down when they mention that ""one day"" I'll get a real job and ""then everything will be fine."" I know I should have hope, by God I tell everyone else that. It's just amazing how I can lift others up but still be so damn chained down by my actions and my life.

The main things keeping me here are my best friend and my brother. They somehow see through me but they know not to poke at it. My God I'm blessed to have them. I'm tearing up just thinking about them.

i just had my drivers test and i failed. i was concentrating on something else and i missed a sign and wanted to go straight from the wrong lane so they failed me.
where i'm from it's pretty standard to fail the first time you have your drivers test so it's not that big of a deal but still whenever i fail at something i just get this deep pit in my stomach and a lot of thoughts that say that i suck and should not be alive and instantly start crying (if not very visibly because it's embarrassing and i try to hide it as hard as i can but eventually i can't stop). even though failing your first drivers test doesn't sound like a big deal i still got a big wave of those emotions now. and i know it's not normal because sure, people don't like failing but they don't get these thoughts (or at least this strong) and i just don't know what to do to not feel like this. what makes it worse is how much money it is and since im in uni and don't have time to work (or if and when i do it's usually not for much money) my parents pay for my lessons and the exam as well and it just makes me feel so stressed because they 'have to' pay so much money because i suck. we're not struggling or anything like that but we're not rich either. i already had a LOT of driving lessons which also cost a lot of money and now i failed the exam too and taking it again costs money again. it's different in school when i fail exams, im still very upset but i can redo it for free one more time(and i always pass if not the first but for the second time).
also im a woman and i study in a male-dominated field (mechanical engineering - im literally the only girl in my class) so the pressure of not enforcing negative stereotypes is always a lot and now im enforcing the stereotype of women being bad drivers - even though i don't believe im awful at driving and i actually like it im just not a naturally born driver either and i make mistakes. i just feel like in heavily male-dominated fields such as mechanical engineering and even just driving i have to be twice as good as a man to not be made fun of which obviously im not because i can't even notice a sign.
i just need advice on how to not take failures this hard because i try so hard to look at the positives but in the end i did fail and that's a lot heavier than all the possible positives. and i put most of the pressure on myself and i don't know why. i just feel like i have to prove many things and i have to be perfect even if that's not possible. but i can't do that if i fail. i don't know where all this comes from i just need advice to deal with failures better because it makes everything so much harder. i haven't always been like this either like in high school i didn't care at all about my grades although i did feel the same thing when i got a very bad one but i was a very average student and i didn't try at all - but tbh i was fighting some other dark thoughts in high school so i didn't care about my grades or anything else really.

Don’t waste it living someone else’s life; stay hungry, stay foolish.” I keep trying to fill my mind with these thoughts, even fantasies, about what my future might look like. I’m afraid to continue on the path I’m on because I know it’s not the right one.

I see people who seem to know what they want to be. Why am I so lost? I have chosen my “career” because I’m good at it, not because I like it. Is this how everyone feels, or am I alone in this feeling of never truly being satisfied, stuck in a constant loop of disappointment? I keep trying to find a different path, but my mind becomes clouded with fantasies about what I think I want to be. But I tell myself, “No, that’s never going to happen for you; you’re not smart enough; you don’t have the skills.” It’s as if one part of me is creating dreams and desires while another part is dismissing them.

I want to experience what it feels like to walk into a room and know I belong. I want to feel satisfied and proud of what I’m doing. I’m unhappy, and I don’t know how to fix it. Not in a depressive way, but in a helpless sort of way. I almost envy actors; they get to show up, put on a façade, become a character, have a few laughs, and make millions doing it. I once thought I wanted to go into film as a cinematographer, creating a fantasy that distracts people from their reality—or at least from mine. I just don’t understand how some people can laugh with their friends on a podcast and make millions a year while others are stuck in a 9-to-5 job where their favorite part of the day is going home.

Back to the film industry. I keep dreaming about how amazing it must be to create art, showing up on set with everyone eager to make what people want to see. Yet I keep telling myself it’s never going to work out; it’ll never be me. It’s this constant loop in my head of what could be but never will be. It scares me that you’re supposed to just know what you want to do with your life. People say you have plenty of time to figure it out, but you don’t. After a while, people just see you as a flake, someone who's too lazy to go to school and get a degree. The truth is, I think very few people are truly doing what they love. I can’t remember the last time I felt happy. I think it was when I was around 13. I felt more real, more like myself. I don’t know who I am anymore. I put on this fake smile with friends, acting like someone I’m not; the truth is, I don’t know who I actually am, and I fear I never will. I think my parents believe this is just my personality now, and maybe it is, but I want to go back to how I felt when I was 13—free from worries about how others perceive me or what my future aspirations are.

,depression_help,"Hey so I'll try keep this short  
  
I've been speaking to this girl for around 2 months. Things have been going insanely well. she described it as we were basically the same person. She approached me after we met on holiday and I didn't take the hints. She added me on snapchat and we spoke for around 2 months.

All day every day. pictures and videos. After 2/3 weeks we started to Facetime every night and watch a film and chat for hours on end. Long story short it was going incredibly well we got on like a house on fire.

Until a Saturday something happened (if it helps I'll explain the situation that happened with her) but something happened that upset her / made her feel a bit trapped and not know what to do, I comforted her about it. On the Sunday / Monday she mentioned that she goes through depression phases / episodes. She mentioned she used to cut herself a year or 2 ago. And she also mentioned that she had a depressive episode in January, March and June this year which lasted a few weeks each time. So we spoke about it a little but not too in depth. I thought nothing of it but because of the situation that had happened she was sad / down for a few days, I asked once or twice if she was still feeling shi\* and she said yeah. 

Fast forward to around Thursday she started to become incredibly distant very slowly. She asked if we couldn't call one night, and she was sending voice mesages and sounded incredibly tired / down. And you know when someone sends you a picture and you can kind of tell there not themselves and not happy. Yeah it was like that. So over the next few days until around Sunday she became really distant, dry on text. No jokes. No Facetiming. No good morning or goodnight texts. And not a lot of talking at all, it was like talking to a whole different person. Now on Monday or Tuesday the following week things were still the same. On Tuesday she didn't even message me at all until around 6/7pm and said that her phone was on dnd which she never does. 

Now we spoke for a little bit but nothing insane, no jokes or anything like that really or good chats it was very simple conversation.

Now... the next day I was blocked on everything! Snapchat, Tiktok, Instagram, My number, she even left the group on whatsapp that we had with me, my mum and her because they had a pretty good relationship together too. So I took this straight to her sister that I get along well with, I explained the situation which may have came across like I was a little angry. And she replied with a voice note saying ""She's going back into her depression phase I'll explain when I'm home"" I never got round to speaking to her about that either.

So I was just wondering, I am the issue here? Did I do something? Did the situation that happen trigger this depressive episode? Does she need space? And how do I handle this... Thanks!

If anyone could help in relating or explaining a little as i've never dealt with a situation like this before. It's been a week since she blocked me and it just struck me by surprise how quick things changed after how good things were going together. I feel we should of spoke more about it, but maybe she didn't want to speak about it and wasn't comfortable in doing so yet.

Hi everyone, I'm getting a little bit concerned about the weight I've lost because of a lack of motivation when it comes to preparing and eating food. I've been on a good track for about 2 years when it comes to it, but recently my depression and anxiety have spiked and I either can't bring myself into the kitchen or I'm too anxious about people looking at me.

I want to gain weight! truly! I'm worried my Dr would assume I'm relapsing and put me on a meal plan i won't keep to, or put me back on medication that i struggle to stay on for long..

Does anyone have any tips for getting in those calories when its hard to get in the kitchen? obviously I can't afford to get takeaway every day 😅 or if anyone's in the UK, were you able to be prescribed something like ensure if meals were too difficult?

,depression_help,"I (26F) have struggled most of my life with mental health issues. A lot of it stemmed from a difficult childhood and as a result, I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression since 14.

Throughout my adult years, I’ve struggled with unhealthy coping mechanisms like drinking, kissing/sleeping with and dating men who weren’t nice etc. Last year in therapy, I made a breakthrough with dealing with some of the family trauma and though things felt a bit better, I was still struggling a lot. I got with my boyfriend during this time and he was supportive throughout and we had the perfect relationship. I decided to quit my job (which was a big contributor to my unhappiness) and go travelling for 6 weeks by myself. Just before I left, my boyfriend fell into a depressive state and it was difficult as where I felt I communicated what I needed from him when I was struggling, he withdrew into himself and shut me out a lot. While I was travelling, I realised the deep rooted reason I was always struggling was because I am very insecure and have pretty much no self esteem. While I was trying to deal with this, I found it increasingly harder to be there for my boyfriend as well and we decided to break up as we both needed time to work on ourselves. It was awful as we still very much love each other. The break up was a turning point for me to start taking the actionable steps to making my life better as I realised it didn’t matter what my circumstances were, I needed to heal for myself.

I reached out 6 weeks later saying I’d reached a place that I could support him better and wanted to try again but he said he wasn’t in the right place mentally (which is where I was at when we broke up). He’s also still hurt bc v soon after we broke up, I got really drunk and kissed someone which he was devastated about but was me turning to old self destructive habits which I regret.

It’s been just over a week since I feel like I went through a 2nd break up with him and since then I’ve been hit with a million realisations about myself &amp; my entire foundations of who I am has been rocked. I know this is a good thing as it means I can rebuild stronger but I am now in a place of feeling hopeless as I don’t know what to think or feel anymore. I can feel new and much healthier thought patterns forming and I’ve stopped going back to old behaviours but day to day I am really struggling and can’t stop crying. Everything feels pointless because I’m so scared of feeling like this forever. I’ve heard things get worse before they get better but I’m scared as it feels like they keep getting worse. I go to therapy but it’s the day to day where I feel lost and I can’t focus on the present. I’m constantly stressing that I’ll forever feel like this and the thoughts don’t go away even when I’m trying to distract myself. I miss my ex so much, I hate that I hurt him and I hate that I couldn’t be there for him in the way I feel I could be now. It feels like my life has completely flipped - I had to move back home, away from most my friends, I came back from travelling with no money, i decided to come off my SSRIs after six years (i felt in a better place to deal with things), I have just started a new job and I am heartbroken.

Last year everything I was put on sertraline 200 mg (slowly dosing) and sulpiride 150 mg + 2mg clonazepam 3x daily.

Even with that high dose of sertraline I was still depressed, so on my actually idea we decided to put me on rTMS treatments. We did 30 treatments and tha helped me better than all meds.

After that, I tappered sertraline to 150mg and then to 125mg, did not felt bad rfects with withdrawals.

And the left me girl and I was depresed but not in clincal way, more sad bc of breakup. Than started mood swings, and I became suicidal, so I decided for hospitalisation.

Here my doctor put me on lamotrigine 75mg now. And also clozapine 75mg. Also I am tappering quetiapine from 25-0, I was on 125mg, quetiapine just did not worked for me.

In two weeks lamotrigine did good job in stabilazing mood (2 weeks on it). Clozapine also did something to lift me up (3weeks on it).

,depression_help,"
Hello.
You don’t know me, and I don’t know you. And that’s okay. Whatever you’re going through, it will pass. The clouds will go, and the sun will shine. All in due time.
Put the pills down, drop the rope, and take a moment to read. And listen to the words I preach.

I’m young. Younger than most of you, that for one is true. I’ve always been depressed, for as long as I remember, I wanted to disappear. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel it now. You’re not alone.
The physical strain on the body, waking up in the morning and wishing you hadn’t, feeling heavy and exhausted no matter how much rest you get. And feeling undeniably, and uncomfortably numb. Cold. Alone. 
It feels like the end, I know it does. But I promise you, you’re strong. You’ve lasted this long, fought so hard. You can keep going. I know you can. 

June 6th 2024, I lost my best friend. He took his life from an overdose and was pronounced dead in his bedroom. His mother messaged me June 24th 2024 to share the news. I didn’t believe it. I thought “he’s a silly kid he’s got to be lying” but he wasn’t. None the less I pushed it off and joked with my friends. Tried to make light of the situation. Then July 4th 2024, his mother sent another messaged. 

“Hi once again dear, it was Xavier’s funeral today. His football team was there and so was Levi. It was a lovely service and they really did take care of him. Thank you for all you’ve done and all the kind words you’ve sent his way. Xavier would be proud of you, like he always said. Good luck with your football and school work, remember Xav is at rest now and he’s no longer hurting. Sometimes these things are for the better. I’ll be deleting the account now, so I will no longer be reached. Thank you Vesper xx”

That’s when it hit me. That woman had lost her son. Her 17 year old boy. And she’s never going to see him again.

Pain is inevitable.

“Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. If you’re that depressed, talk to somebody.” 
-Robin Williams

You’ll be okay.

People will feel the pain. Xavier was a good friend. I hadn’t spoken to him much in the running to weeks as he was doing A-level exams and I was doing mock exams. He lived hours away and was unreachable most days. 

My point is. People will miss you. When you’re dark and alone, you feel like no one will care. But people will. You’re somebodies best friend, someone’s rock, someone’s child, someone’s role model and someone’s love. The pain is transferable. And although Suicide is an easier way out of a life that has treated you badly, it isn’t the only option. 

Talk to someone.

Speak out.


You’re loved.
Appreciated.
Beautiful.
Handsome.
Validated.
Cared.
Important.

And you are relevant.

Rest in peace Xavier. Gone too soon. Too far. I’ll be with you someday, until then. I love you. Forever and always, like we used to say. I’ll help people in memory of you. My boy. My love. My life. Thank you.

You don’t know me, and I don’t know you. And that’s okay. Whatever you’re going through, it will pass. The clouds will go, and the sun will shine. All in due time.
Put the pills down, drop the rope, and take a moment to read. And listen to the words I preach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m young. Younger than most of you, that for one is true. I’ve always been depressed, for as long as I remember, I wanted to disappear. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel it now. You’re not alone.
The physical strain on the body, waking up in the morning and wishing you hadn’t, feeling heavy and exhausted no matter how much rest you get. And feeling undeniably, and uncomfortably numb. Cold. Alone. 
It feels like the end, I know it does. But I promise you, you’re strong. You’ve lasted this long, fought so hard. You can keep going. I know you can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 6th 2024, I lost my best friend. He took his life from an overdose and was pronounced dead in his bedroom. His mother messaged me June 24th 2024 to share the news. I didn’t believe it. I thought “he’s a silly kid he’s got to be lying” but he wasn’t. None the less I pushed it off and joked with my friends. Tried to make light of the situation. Then July 4th 2024, his mother sent another messaged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hi once again dear, it was Xavier’s funeral today. His football team was there and so was Levi. It was a lovely service and they really did take care of him. Thank you for all you’ve done and all the kind words you’ve sent his way. Xavier would be proud of you, like he always said. Good luck with your football and school work, remember Xav is at rest now and he’s no longer hurting. Sometimes these things are for the better. I’ll be deleting the account now, so I will no longer be reached. Thank you Vesper xx”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when it hit me. That woman had lost her son. Her 17 year old boy. And she’s never going to see him again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pain is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. If you’re that depressed, talk to somebody.” 
-Robin Williams&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People will feel the pain. Xavier was a good friend. I hadn’t spoken to him much in the running to weeks as he was doing A-level exams and I was doing mock exams. He lived hours away and was unreachable most days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is. People will miss you. When you’re dark and alone, you feel like no one will care. But people will. You’re somebodies best friend, someone’s rock, someone’s child, someone’s role model and someone’s love. The pain is transferable. And although Suicide is an easier way out of a life that has treated you badly, it isn’t the only option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk to someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speak out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re loved.
Appreciated.
Beautiful.
Handsome.
Validated.
Cared.
Important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you are relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Childlinehttps://&lt;a href=""http://www.childline.org.uk""&gt;www.childline.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in immediate danger, call your countries emergency service number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rest in peace Xavier. Gone too soon. Too far. I’ll be with you someday, until then. I love you. Forever and always, like we used to say. I’ll help people in memory of you. My boy. My love. My life. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"When do you start to have depression? 
Good evening, I always thought it was normal not to enjoy life that much. And that it's my fault. Overall, it always happens that I don't like living. Not like I would take my own life. But it is so bad that I often wish that I had simply not been born. Or that it would finally just be over. 

My life feels like I always have a TO Do list that I can't manage to complete and that stresses me out. None of the tasks is fun for me. 
And when I have completed my tasks, I feel empty. And I know that there are new ones on there and I have to force myself to edit them forever. 
Although I'm not having fun. I don't even enjoy my hobbies. And if I don't do anything, I feel very worthless. 
Because my never ending todo list is waiting and there are always tasks on it. 
So I don't have fun when I'm not doing anything, nor when I'm doing something. 

The only time I feel okay is when I'm productive enough to distract myself. But not good. When I've accomplished something, I feel good for a moment, with the thought that something new is waiting. And when I don't do anything, I feel absolutely like crap. 

So it's like a cycle of doing things to distract myself, feeling okay because I'm done, feeling crappy because I'm bored/empty inside/I know there are always new tasks waiting, I don't feel like doing the tasks, and fighting the eternal to-do list, I finally motivate myself to start so I can stop feeling like shit, feel okay while I'm doing something... only to repeat everything. 

I often think that if I were just dead, I would never have to put in so much effort to be able to live and do tasks again. I always thought it was like that for everyone, because everyone has to do things. But apparently there are people who consider themselves lucky and content. 

Then I try to be productive again because then I no longer have anything in front of me that's weighing me down, I'm happy to have finally achieved it, only to find myself in a hole again because I'm doing nothing.

,depression_help,"Over the past month of living in our new house, my parents were constantly telling my neighbors behind us to go and barricade their side of the fence so that our dogs can avoid conflict between each-other. (Mind you, we covered our side of the fence but we wanted better safety measures considering the dog they have.) Our neighbors never took out warnings with consideration and never thought too much about it. Our dog is also an amputee (meaning she has three legs) which is why we took this situation with more precaution.

About 36 hours ago, i found out that my baby was dragged under the fence and into our neighbors backyard and was mauled to death by their husky. We found out because me and my mom was looking for her and saw that there was a gap under the fence along with the husky’s digging hole and immediately looked over the fence to make sure if she was there. Later to see her lifeless body and blood on her face. 

We called the police and even animal control but they didn’t do much for us considering how our dog ended up on there backyard and not onto ours. I understand that accidents happened, but what was upsetting me the most was how preventable this was from both cases and how the neighbors took no accountability for their dog’s actions. 

Mind you that the husky dug a hole UNDER the fence and was clearly visible from the neighbors backyard that there was a lot of dirt scattered by the husky’s digging. Our dog isn’t capable of digging because she only has THREE LEGS. Not only is our neighbors not taking any accountability, but the police and animal control aren’t doing much either.

I got to say one last goodbye to her at the hospital and gave her the biggest hug that I have ever given. She is getting cremated and I even plan on getting an urn necklace to remember her by. She was my first dog, and it’s sad to see her go out like this. Her death was sad but fairly quick and I feel more at peace knowing that she didn’t have to suffer long.

I don’t have the energy to type this in the actual way I feel but I’ll try.

I think I suppressed my emotions for my entire childhood to avoid conflict, I was always rewarded for being the silent kid in class. I was always punished unfairly in favor of my younger step brother, my only surviving mechanism in an abusive household with my step mom and dad is to just be quiet.

Now a couple of years later, I finally live on my own, I’m still a teen (17) but I feel like my entire childhood was stolen from me. I tried making friends but everyone just.. silenty pushes me away, so I started blocking people. I stopped trying to make contact with anyone because I know they don’t and won’t care. 

And I don’t blame them, I don’t think I will like me either, they’ve always complained that I’m too silent, they always complained when I let myself go. I can’t count the amount of times people mistook me for being high on drugs when I was just being myself.

My friends don’t like to show me off, I always find them hanging out with their main friendgroups for the “fun” stuff. While I’m just a side dish for them that they occasionally get if they’re bored. 

So I blocked and stopped talking to them, now I feel like I’m unable to open my mouth to talk at all. I hate this feeling of loneliness but I hate being rejected and betrayed over and over again.

,depression_help,"I've not worked because of my depression for nearly a year and it doesnt look like i'm going to be getting back into work in the near future. Has anyone been in similar situations and still found a way to date?

Like, it's gonna be one of the first things people ask when you start talking. I wouldn't know what to say, just being open about everything immediately would be way too much. It's not that i dont want to work, I do, there's just no way I'm quite ready. I'm waiting for employment support from this organisation that helps people with mental health problems find work again, but there's a waiting list and its months long. I'm also getting help for my depression via mental health team. But my issues are life long so far, its not like i could just focus on fixing the depression first then start trying to date, because its not likely to go away, certainly would be long-term thing if I can ever get over it.

Dating is such a big part of life and i'm missing out on so much, which doesn't make me feel any better. Ive been on the usual dating apps, can get matches but I'm too scared to talk to them. I just know when it comes up I'm probably gonna embarrass myself and just end up feeling some kind of shame, then also have to deal with the rejection. And I have no career, being in and out of work because of depression saw to that, so its not like I can say that 'I usually work in so and so but just taking a break for a bit'. I'm also 35, so it's not like I'm still young - people have expectations once you're this age.

I know it's not gonna be easy anyway, but if anyone has been/is in a similar situation and found a good way to get around this issue or has any advice. Maybe there are certain ways to frame it...?

,depression_help,"Hi, thanks for reading.

I'm a second year graduate student at a State school in the deep south. I was a Teaching Assistant for the first year and now I'm getting a full ride + stipend scholarship with the DoD. Logistically my life is going well.

Unfortunately something happened which has thrown me off balance and has me pretty depressed. I was in a discord server for a specific technical student organization at my Uni. I was pretty established and frequently posted scholarship opportunities. I invited someone and they went on to be a troll. Not really offensive or outright political but still problematic. Anyway they ended up inviting another shitposter who then invited another shitposter. And that guy posted a picture of his jeans with a bulge with something along the lines of ""20M 8inch etc"". It was obviously a shitpost but the server was eventually deleted once they realized the shitposting wasn't going to stop.

Anyway I was associated with those guys as I invited one of them. One of my Professors and research advisors asked to speak with me today and told me that there was a student rumor that I (former TA) sent a picture of my yknow what in the server. He had to report it and stood up for me by showing the other faculty that it wasn't a full on NSFW photo, nor was it from my account.

Regardless, now people are looking at me differently and my interactions have changed. I only have a year of my Masters left until I begin working at a DoD facility while getting a second MS online. I'm just really fucked up about the whole situation and don't really know how to move forward. I feel like I should just avoid our department building altogether until I graduate and leave.

Any advice for people that have been in a similar situation and have had to hide their scars? Oh yea for context I&amp;#39;m a guy in university and no one suspects a thing so far, but today I had to wear a goofy ass fit of a hoodie and some shorts that didn&amp;#39;t go together at all. I know compared to the people who actually need help this sounds silly but this is important to me and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do, so any help would be greatly appreciated&lt;/p&gt;

Been thinking about this for some time now and I need some opinions about it. I know that making peace with one's self is of the upmost importance if you want a happy life, but I seem to struggle. Is not that I don't want to, I can't. That's why I'm seeking opinions

Unconsciously I've, metaphorically, killed my younger self in order to sculpt the new me how I saw fit at that time, yet I remain ""incomplete"". I can't imagine my younger self anymore. What would they do? How would they see this issue I have? Would they like how I am right now? Would we be friends? 

I think I should pay homage to them, because they were my stepping stone, and, in some ways, I loved them as I loved my close ones.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m scared of everything and don&amp;#39;t know what to do. My life fell apart recently and I thought I was over it. I wish I could do something. I have no friends or family. I just want to do something about myself but I don&amp;#39;t know what I can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t use any drugs or substances, I don&amp;#39;t party. I don&amp;#39;t even think I have depression but at this point I logically can&amp;#39;t come up with another explanation.When things start getting overwhelming I just curl up in my room (that I&amp;#39;m about to run out of money for) and read.

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have a job, I don&amp;#39;t play games, I occupy my time with sitting here and reading all day- skipping meals for days usually. It&amp;#39;s the only thing that lets me escape from the crushing reality of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway here’s one for tonight, for context time I wrote one of these was in 2021, and attempted suicide a year later. But I feel like I’m loosing grips on myself again.

It would just be another lie,
To tell you that I’m alright, it would still be lying, to say I’m not thinking of dying. Because I’m not and I am. To tell you the truth, for once and for real, I’ll try to say how I feel.
I feel scared, I feel low, I feel bad,” I feel cold. I feel like I don’t belong, among my family or friends, I feel like I’ll just bring them,
more pain and contempt. To all the people I love, the ones I have hurt. The one ive left with not much more than disappointment.
One more sorry is meaningless, and there’s no apology that I can express that will make sense. I think I’ve just come to terms, with the simple fact that I’m meant to live and die alone. As I don’t posses the capacity to not hurt others and hurt me. With every relationship, I ruin with a slip by slip. When sobriety sounds so foreign, as my pain and my disappointment, keep me From ever taking a step forward. I fear that it’s too late for me, to ever find serenity, to ever feel calm and well, to stop living in emotional hell.  
If every choice I have, is the wrong one, does that make me bad? If any of the choices I make, will still hurt the people I love, and will all make my heart still ache. When expectations of where I should be, are so far off from reality.
I feel like I don’t ever catch my breath before going under water again. And the shittiest part is it all my fault. With every wave tearing me more apart. I don’t think I even know what is still even acceptable, in todays world just to make it, I wonder if having money and stability would change anyone’s perception of how they view me. In the end though, it’s how do I view myself, I’ve stopped asking it as I’ve began to fear, because that answer always brings me to tears. As I think of me in the worst of light. As the only one who can’t do what’s right.
Regardless of its difficulty or ease, I’ll do it wrong no matter what I say or I plan. And feeling this way only reinforces every one of my poor choices. So, stuck in a loop I start, to spin and spin and fall apart. And hurt more people that I love, and as I look but the one solution I find, is the only one that shouldn’t come to mind. As I’ve grown tired of being this way, and I can’t even trust what I say.

,depression_help,"My suicide letter

I’m still alive. I don’t know if I can take it anymore. I never found my deer. I never sent this to everyone so I’ll post it here so someone can read what I have to say.


Life is a funny thing. I used to think that no matter what happens to me, I would be ok. 

Over the course of one year I’ve seen person after person who I truly believed would always be there for me, hurt me and leave me to my own pain. 

My mother, my girl, my family. My old life. My connections, Gone.

What had I done to have this happen to me? I did my best in a bad situation. I stood up for what I believed was right. What followed, was betrayal, lies, and punishment, and in my grief, I made mistakes. The people I loved then told me these mistakes were unforgivable, and left me. As if I was nothing. A chapter of there story, something to be left in the past. The only person in the present left to care about me was myself, but how could I? 

Anything I did, what was the point of it? Nobody would be there to watch. Nobody to tell my story. To laugh with. Cry with. To live with. Nobody would care, so what was the purpose? Why was I put here, just to suffer? To hurt? Why couldn’t anyone, even just one person, see me. 
I couldn’t understand it, not until today.

Who could ever love me now?

I lose the ability to live. 
I lost the ability to love. 
I lost who I am. 
I am a husk of who I once was.

Somewhere deep within me, there is a little boy. My old self. Who I really am.
My mom used to always say
“where is our happy boy?” 
I know where he is. He’s in a cage, waiting for the ones he loves to let him out. But the truth is, everyone with a key, is never coming back. 

Today I realized something. I have a key. 

For that crying little boy, waiting to be picked up. Waiting to be held. Waiting, and waiting, forever, to be loved again.

I will end his suffering. 
I will set him free.

It only takes 1 person, to learn to love this thing we call life. And all they have to do, is see you, the way that you see them. That, is love.
When you lose that, there is nothing. 

A life without love, it’s meaningless. 

I don’t know if I have the ability to love anyone anymore. I feel it’s slipped away, and I’ve lost it. I am broken. Even now, I know that to be true. But part of me still cares about a few people. The only reason I am still breathing is because of the people that made me care. For that, I am thankful.

To my Dad, my Brother my sister, my best friends.

I love you. I’m glad I got to live a little with each of you.

I’m sorry for this. I truly am. I’m sorry I wasn’t strong enough to fight this.

Please, remember this when I am gone…

I will die thinking of you. 

Ever since I was younger, I thought nature was like magic. Deer are just so cool. They make me feel at peace. And after 19 years, I finally understand why. 

They can see me. 

I think I’ll go try and find one.

,depression_help,"I (29 yo M) was recently diagnosed with Coronary Heart Disease, my case is not the worst, the fat seems to be blocking only 30% or so of the artery, but it's enough for me to have some pain in my chest and a little bit of fatigue. I know very well what I should do to fix this, but I honestly have no desire to do so. Not only that, but I have tried throughout my life to get my weight in order, and it only made things worse, I am around 255 lbs now, and honestly, I don't think I care enough to get my shit together, and I know that I have depression, but I really don't care about it anymore.

Not to mention, my whole damn life is a mess now, an ex-friend of my stole around 20k from me and my wife, and she is probably out of the country by now, there is literally nothing that the government in my country can do to help me out. So now I am just trying to earn my money back, but while at work I noticed that I gave up on trying, I have enough money to maintain my lifestyle anyway, so I am pretty much doing the whole ""quiet quitting"" thing and trying to reduce stress, and this made me realize how much I don't care about any other thing. I don't think I care anymore about trying to find a career in academia, I don't think I wanna have children anymore, neither does my wife.

I know that I am being defeatist, but I have been trying to get my shit together for more than 10 years now, and it has only backfired and made things worse. Honestly, just not caring and enjoying life at the moment has made things so much better for me, I don't feel the pressure to lose weight, I don't feel the pressure to have a child, nor do I care if I die. But I get it, I don't really like myself, but it's hard to enjoy being myself when you live with chronic migraines and need constant medication in order to keep your hives in check.

That's why I find it weird when people go on those self-improvement journeys, in the end, they always create a narrative for themselves that will basically serve as their personal hell, and I tried to do that, but it's not something that I feel ashamed or fearful enough to care about. Like, I tried to go really deep into this whole thing, I really tried to ""improve"" my mental health for almost 10 years or so, by going to many therapists, Shrooms, Ayahuasca, religion, etc., and everything made me come to the same conclusion, that I really don't like myself and I don't care enough to try to make things better, at least in the current  moment.  And I have to be honest, while that can feel liberating, it's also a bit scary, not sure why.

Anyway, not sure If I am asking for help or just venting.

I know very well what I should do to fix this, but I honestly have no desire to do so. Not only that, but I have tried throughout my life to get my weight in order, and it only made things worse, I am around 255 lbs now, and honestly, I don&amp;#39;t think I care enough to get my shit together, and I know that I have depression, but I really don&amp;#39;t care about it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, my whole damn life is a mess now, an ex-friend of my stole around 20k from me and my wife, and she is probably out of the country by now, there is literally nothing that the government in my country can do to help me out. So now I am just trying to earn my money back, but while at work I noticed that I gave up on trying, I have enough money to maintain my lifestyle anyway, so I am pretty much doing the whole &amp;quot;quiet quitting&amp;quot; thing and trying to reduce stress, and this made me realize how much I don&amp;#39;t care about any other thing. I don&amp;#39;t think I care anymore about trying to find a career in academia, I don&amp;#39;t think I wanna have children anymore, neither does my wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I am being defeatist, but I have been trying to get my shit together for more than 10 years now, and it has only backfired and made things worse. Honestly, just not caring and enjoying life at the moment has made things so much better for me, I don&amp;#39;t feel the pressure to lose weight, I don&amp;#39;t feel the pressure to have a child, nor do I care if I die. But I get it, I don&amp;#39;t really like myself, but it&amp;#39;s hard to enjoy being myself when you live with chronic migraines and need constant medication in order to keep your hives in check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I find it weird when people go on those self-improvement journeys, in the end, they always create a narrative for themselves that will basically serve as their personal hell, and I tried to do that, but it&amp;#39;s not something that I feel ashamed or fearful enough to care about. Like, I tried to go really deep into this whole thing, I really tried to &amp;quot;improve&amp;quot; my mental health for almost 10 years or so, by going to many therapists, Shrooms, Ayahuasca, religion, etc., and everything made me come to the same conclusion, that I really don&amp;#39;t like myself and I don&amp;#39;t care enough to try to make things better, at least in the current  moment.  And I have to be honest, while that can feel liberating, it&amp;#39;s also a bit scary, not sure why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, not sure If I am asking for help or just venting. My wife is in the same situation more or less, and it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that we feed each other&amp;#39;s depression, but we both know that we were already super depressed before we met, honestly, this sort of thing made up more relatable towards each other, so at least we can live peacefully while together, so I guess in a way I am trying to find some help, even though I gave up on myself. It really sucks because I really did try to improve my mental health, but it only backed fired in the long term, so I am kinda scared to try anything at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know my situation is kinda bizarre, but I would appreciate any advice from someone that has already &amp;quot;giving up&amp;quot;, maybe on how to cope with day-to-day life?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Hi everyone -

So, my freshman year of college I met a boy (19M), (and I was (19F)), who went to a school about 15 minutes away from me. We talked for about three or four months and we had met up once and had a nice time. We texted for a few months everyday after that, and this individual would be flirty over text messages. He would say things like I was cute, and being a naive young woman I liked his words. The whole thing was confusing and I guess there was some miscommunication, but the next time we met up we ended up being intimate with each other. He never texted me ever again and when I did text and reach out he was acting like I was an ugly disease he needed to get away from. He blocked my number. The feeling that I am a blocked number on a phone and possibly a disease to someone else after being intimate with them is an absolutely awful thing to live with.

I would really appreciate any tips on healing, comfort words, young women's experiences, young men's advice, preventing depressive and unwanted thoughts, and advice on moving forward with my life.

eg to avoid shouting and being offensive when upset or allowing me to finish what im doing and then help her rather than expecting me to drop whatever im doing the second she needs something from me. i cant do anything about it or even attemp to express to her the impact her words can have on my concious and subconcious mind let alone my siblings too having to hear it every day. its so damaging especially to children. ive accepted that things wont change and she is also just a human expressing herself and her struggle in the only way she knows how but i want to find someone that also genuinely experiences this. not  someone that has a loving mother that can be overwhelming and naggy sometimes. but someone who has a cold and distant single parent. i want to know how other children kept themselves going and focussed and motivated in life. how they contunued to love themselves and not allow these things to stick or create deep-rooted subconscious insecurities.

""i don't know"" (refusing to tell me) or that she's gonna kill herself. i get her to explain and it's usually she thinks her friends hate her (they don't they are close like childhood friends), or she thinks she is useless, or she misses me and acts like i can do anything about it. i've tried to ask to go back but my dad won't let me. he hates my mum because 4 years ago she didn't reply to me for a whole over covid, and has been looking for more reason to hate her ever since. she threatens to get my mum to talk to him, or rock up to my house which will only make things worse, but she doesn't care. whenever i try and help her she argues it, it's as if she's looking for reasons to be upset. she could have a good day out with her friends and then get home and say they hate her and she had a shit day. i've asked her to get therapy and she goes but refuses to tell them anything. idk why. she just won't. she looks for reasons to be sad, and looks for the bad in everything. she refuses my help, and when i talk about how her friends don't hate her she just says she has no place and wants to kill herself. i love her, but i don't know what to do. she refuses to take my advice, and just says she's gonna kill herself and starts crying whenever i make a good point. i love her but please help it hurts to see her like this and it makes me mad that she won't accept my help.

,depression_help,"I'm a 29 year old (F) living in the southern half of the USA whose trying to leave her parents' home. For a little context, I made some bad choices during my teenage years due to depression which eventually turned into health problems. Because of my slow start into adulthood and lack of education beyond high school, my parents convinced me to stay with them until I got back on my feet. But my mother got cancer a couple of years later and I ended up supporting both her and my father financially for several years until she died in 2023. 

The problem I'm facing now is that I saved up some money to get a used car, which turned out to be a piece of junk. I had to take out a couple loans to fix it and when a third one was needed, I ended up trading it in for something more reliable. In addition to a new car payment, my job also placed its workers on multiple furloughs and I had to get a credit card to pay bills and buy groceries, which is now maxed out. I'm struggling financially to get myself in a good enough position to move out and become financially and personally independent, between these new bills, lack of savings, and credit debt. 

To make a long story short, the reason why I'm trying so hard to leave currently is because in the year since my mother has died...my already emotionally and mentally abusive father has gotten a lot worse and I'm struggling to make ends meet on top of being in a severe state of depression, which has only gotten worse with his abuse.  He has stopped paying for groceries and left me entirely responsible for it, as well as keeping me on his phone plan and insurance. 

I'm struggling to find a better job, or even a part-time one to supplement my income, I'm struggling to find a place cheap enough for rent, separating my bills from his, and also just finding the courage to leave. 

If anyone could please just give me some ideas to try, places to go for assistance, things to do to help with my depression that don't break the bank, how to consolidate my debt and get bills turned over into just my name, words of encouragement even...

I don't have anyone in my life that can help me. My friends have promised me to be on the lookout for job openings and offered me places to stay but when I reach out, I hear nothing. My family is in full support of my dad and I cannot go to them for sympathy, much less for help. I don't know what to do or where to go and I can't keep living like this. I can barely think most days.

,depression_help,"Heres my situation and my symptoms


So basically I recently left my ex due to his manipulative and toxic behaviors, during our relationship he often would make me say jokes I never thought were funny and is now using them to blackmail me, he’s been sending them to my friends and basically telling me that if I don’t get back together with him then he’s gonna post them. I just got a no contact order and he cant exactly do anything else without getting in legal trouble. So I dont have to worry about him anymore.

Along with that my mom is trying to get full custody of me due to my dads drinking problem and all this other shit I dont wanna get into. I love my dad and its hard to see his life fall apart except he makes me feel like I need to be responsible for it, like he cant afford to live where he lives and is making me look at places for him ( I am a highschooler ) His girlfriend left him and thats been his main trigger for drinking. My mom cares about nothing but my grades and not how I feel so I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I still wanna see my dad and idk what to do

I have great friends but I cant really explain everything to them because I don’t feel like they will care enough to listen or if they do they just wont get it, I dont even know whats going on with me? 


Ever since then ive just felt really hopeless?? Like I dont know what I want to do with my life, and I just keep asking myself whats the point of living in general? Im not su1c1d@l but I ask myself these questions all the time. Along with that, nothing seems fun anymore. I used to love to draw and play video games and stuff but now I just dont even feel like I have the energy to. When I get home from school all I do is sleep even if im not tired its just to escape the constant anxiety I feel. My appetite is much less and I can barely stomach food. My grades are going down and I don’t have the energy to fix them and when I try to tell my mom that she just says “well you need to get them up” 

I constantly feel stressed out and sad and hopeless and I just want someone to listen to me and tell me what is going on with me because im just confused, ive never been a sad person or anything or the type to be depressed. It feels like everything is progressively getting worse.

I have diagnosed ADHD and anxiety, I also take accutane which ive heard can make you feel down. My dose just recently went up aswell.

I dont know I just hope someone reads this and gives me a response. It feels like nobody cares and everyone is caught up inside their own shit.

I'm 19 years old, and I've attempted the 10th grade four times without success. To be honest, I don't feel like I ""failed"" in the traditional sense because I never truly put in the effort — I didn’t even open the books. So, in reality, I didn’t try at all. Now, I'm at a point where I'm really concerned about my future. I want to live a better life, and I definitely don’t want to face starvation or struggle for basic needs. 

Every time I try to motivate myself to study, it lasts for maybe two or four days at most, and then all the drive and interest just disappear. I know I need to do something, but this lack of passion and consistency is holding me back. 

I don’t want to give up, but I’m struggling to figure out how to keep that fire going. Any advice or similar experiences would be appreciative

,depression_help,"So yeah... I just want to end it. There's no point and in my head it's a very rational and logical decision. I know it's the sickness that makes you feel sad. It's a symptom. But then I've been sick all my life. I'm 40 F. I've been medicated for more than 20 years, so tried pretty much all there is, lots of alcohol and drugs also... (stoped all that 6 years ago) I mean I'm trying... I eat well for the neuron in our guts and all . I exercise for the dopamine and self estime and all...  I had magnetic stimulation of my brain, electric stimulation, took ketamine (the medication not the drug drug). And therapy therapy therapy...

I finally have in the perfect house. With land right in front of it for animals. 2 goats 1 sheep 1 dog chickens.. I used to have donkeys but I let them go when I realised I just couldn't take care of them. Last winter one of my goats was really skinny and I didn't do anything about it for a long time. I mean I shouldn't had plan things when I was trying. Because it didn't work out and turns out I'm not able to do the things I thought would bring me joy, taking care of rescued animals. I'm not able, reliable, to be trusted with anything. Because most of the times I just can't move, think, decide or just get up and do. Right now some wires (hard to explain) could really hurts them. Didn't do anything about it, it's been days.
I do nothing. I don't work. I have an allocation for handicapped people. I'm just sitting there, forever empty, wishing to die . And I been wishing to die... all my life. Spent 5 years all together in psychiatric hospitals and clinics. 
It's just been too long. It's not gonna work that's just a constatation. I felt good for 6 months in 2015. So everyone has been like if it happened it can happen again. Ok I'll try more. It's been 10 years now!!
I didn't want to be super happy and confident and all that. I just wanted to be ok. Relieved and a little bit at peace. Able to do the bare minimum to take care of myself (and the animals, who kind of are a continuation of myself so I treat them like I treat myself, if it makes sense...) 
But yeah.. just do small things, change their water or just brush my hair but without all the selfhate allways in my head that spoils everything all the time. I've been through some stuffs. But so did most of my friends and they get back up and fight. I couldn't do that. I'm not that kind of person. Resiliency forgot about me.
I don't have purpose. I wanted to help others. But I have social phobia so that complicated things. I grew up in a big city and kind of escaped it because of that and constant sexual harassment everywhere. I thought ok your life is elsewhere, you're sick you'll just have to adapt and find your own way. I did. And I'm still miserable. 
I have 2 or 3 friends who live very far so we just text sometimes. I don't have a family. I'm alone and gave up in relationships with other people because what's the point if it takes you 3 days in bed to recover from a panic created by a simple conversation with a neighbour. What the point if a good interaction becomes like a huge performance that you can't replicate.

,depression_help,"So, first post!

Sitting here night after night now drinking alone while my wife and kids are asleep and for months, not having anyone to talk to without feeling like a burden..figured maybe someone here can at least read my vent.. And hope that helps. 

40\M, married 17 years, 5 boys. 

I try be a good father to my kids.... Think Ive done ok so far as they are all respectful, liked, kind and smart. Handsome little ass holes they are.

So, back story. About 8 years ago, my wife came to me and told me she had feelings for another man. She knew it was wrong and a stupid crush and went to counseling to hopefully get it all worked out. We'd been married for 9 years and it came out of nowhere. Guy isnt a close friend, but an acquaintance I've known for years. Rich, muscular etc etc. This crushed me but I wanted to make it work. Obviously, I was missing something she wanted.

Anyway, ended up getting 'through' this patch over the years and she's says she moved past this.

Now, it's been 8 years, and it still kicks me in the balls almost daily. I can usually move past it because she's loving enough and giving up isn't an option.

My problem lately is... Its been getting to me more and more to the point I'll sit randomly staring at the stars for hours at night drinking until wee early am while she sleeps because it F's with my mind again.

I can't bring it up to her, because I don't want to keep bringing up the past that hurts her too. My best friends know of the issue and I talked with them a while ago about how it was killing me but never really got follow up. I get it.. Wtf do you even say? So I don't bother them with it anymore. So lately, it's been easting at me a bit. The more I think about how chances are it could happen again, the more distance I become, which makes it worse. I don't know how the duck the break my cycle.
I don't want to show her I'm broken, because no woman wants to see her man as a 'fragile' little man that can't supper her.

I'm so stuck.. The worse I feel, the more distant I get hoping for some hope, the leas I see, so the worse it gets.

I've surface talked to a psychiatrist about my issues (husband and wife team that my wife used her) but its a religious team and the answer is always 'pray'. Now
. I'm pretty religious, but if a Dr told me to pray to heal my cancer, I wouldn't think that's a pretty good answer to my issue.

Anyway, I said my bit. I'm not suicidal FYI... And I have zero interest in leaving my wife or my kids. Guess I just needed to vent.

Anyone have comments? This probably just get lost in the abyss of reddit...... ",t2_kf8tmyn9n,False,,0,False,"40/M, Married 17 years, 5 kids, noone to talk to in my life.

&lt;p&gt;My problem lately is... Its been getting to me more and more to the point I&amp;#39;ll sit randomly staring at the stars for hours at night drinking until wee early am while she sleeps because it F&amp;#39;s with my mind again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t bring it up to her, because I don&amp;#39;t want to keep bringing up the past that hurts her too. My best friends know of the issue and I talked with them a while ago about how it was killing me but never really got follow up. I get it.. Wtf do you even say? So I don&amp;#39;t bother them with it anymore. So lately, it&amp;#39;s been easting at me a bit. The more I think about how chances are it could happen again, the more distance I become, which makes it worse. I don&amp;#39;t know how the duck the break my cycle.
I don&amp;#39;t want to show her I&amp;#39;m broken, because no woman wants to see her man as a &amp;#39;fragile&amp;#39; little man that can&amp;#39;t supper her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so stuck.. The worse I feel, the more distant I get hoping for some hope, the leas I see, so the worse it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve surface talked to a psychiatrist about my issues (husband and wife team that my wife used her) but its a religious team and the answer is always &amp;#39;pray&amp;#39;. Now
. I&amp;#39;m pretty religious, but if a Dr told me to pray to heal my cancer, I wouldn&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a pretty good answer to my issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I said my bit. I&amp;#39;m not suicidal FYI... And I have zero interest in leaving my wife or my kids. Guess I just needed to vent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone have comments? This probably just get lost in the abyss of reddit...... &lt;/p&gt;

I'm fat and got bullied as a kid. I never had friends and was scared of others.

In my teens I got included in some groups but was always the last in the hierarchy. I developed self hate and the feeling of being inferior and worthless. As I started to like girls it never worked. Often my crushes got hooked up with my friends. It also happend that I listened to my friends having sex with my crushes. This developed anger and much more feeling of worthlessness. It also developed a fetish of cuckolding and today I often only can get off when I'm emotionally abused.

Today I gained a lot more confidence and I'm losing weight, but I have so much pain in me. When I meet new people I always have the feeling that I'm hated.

I know that I can be proud of me, because I'm now a better person than five years ago and in work and study life I'm doing very well. But my sociallife, my lovelife and my thoughts are wracked.

I started to just jerk off on weekends and now I'm feeling better but my desire for this cuck porn which hurts me so much is getting stronger and stronger

,depression_help,"I have been depressed for most of my life. But have always been a very optimistic person. I was in therapy once at 15, and the therapist told me I was faking it. A part of me broke bc I was definitely an invisible child growing up, always hiding my hurt, my pain and parenting my own parents. So when I finally got into therapy I thought I will let it all out, this time I will get help. It crushed me hard and I could never trust a therapist ever again... I am 27 now. And my life has been a mess. Sometimes I function, really well, and then a small thing throws me out of the loop into a deep hole I need months to crawl out of. I don't have any friends but my bf. I don't have anyone I consider family, but my little brother. And I always push through .. just one more day, week, month. It will get better ... It never really does. I always regret pushing though. 

Now tomorrow it will be two months that my brother died. He died 2 weeks before his 18th birthday on a allergic reaction. I loved him so much, we were so close and now he is gone.

I live 3 hours away from my hometown, still going to college, so I could barely visit him. But we would text a lot, and we would talk about everything. His death feels like a cruel joke by fate. 

The last time I saw him was on my birthday in may. 

Everything feels so meaningless now. I dont think I can function, my bf is the only one who actually knows how crushed I am. I can't show this side to my family. They don't even ask how I am doing. Everyone is pampering my mother now. Honestly it feel like I am the last person those assholes would care about. 

I really don't know where to go or what to do, I can't live this life anymore. It just doesnt make sense without him. It feels wrong to grow old, it feels wrong to exist when he doesn't. 

My boyfriend/fiance is the only one I have left. But he doesn't really see the severity of the situation. He just pushes me to go take my exams for university. I couldn't care less honestly. I just wanna drop out now, I wanna leave everything and everyone. I wanna run away, hide in a hole and just die. 

Everyday gets worse. 

I was my brother's favorite person, and I always felt like he was all the family I had. 

I feel so silly for being so optimistic, I feel so silly for pushing through. I wish I didnt have to experience this loss. I miss him so much, and words can't describe how lovely he was. And when I hear my family talk about him, I can see that he was closer to me in every way. 
I am so hurt. I am so angry and I feel like everything turned to nothing when he left. 

I can't go to therapy because of my trauma. I can't function properly, I have crippling anxiety and depression, I am a failure in every way. I have no friends, no support system other than my fiance who has his own things to deal with. I don't know what to do or where to go. 

So I came here for this rant. The more I try to sort my feelings the more it feels like suicide is the only option. I am not happy, and I am sick of telling myself that I will be some day.

 I loved this cat. My heart sank. The neighbors and I aren't exactly friendly, let's just say that we have two different political signs in our yards. 

So basically Sunday night was the last time I saw this cat and the last time I would ever see him after 10 years. 

I feel so powerless. 

Since Sunday I have (kind of) got over the cat but I think what happened is that it pushed me into a deep depression and I cannot for the life of me shake this tightness in my chest for days now. And I'm miserable and I'm not getting anything done and I can barely shower etc. 

I have been diagnosed with ADHD and am treated with Wellbutrin but over the weekend I did miss two doses because we are at a wedding and I was forgetful etc so I'm sure that didn't help...

,depression_help,"Now what?

Hello, I will spare people of the whys and keep it simple. I have severe depression and anxiety.

I have been on prescribed medications for many years. Without success. I have never self medicated nor do I drink alcohol.

In may I was in a closed psychiatric ward for a month for the risk of suicide. In there I went on several new drugs with little to no effect. I then was administered ECT treatment. Without success.

I was released because the doctors didnt see any improvements and they couldnt ""cure"" my affliction in a closed ward.

They now want to administer lithium as a treatment. I am not too happy as it seems like a drug that might take more time than I am willing to give for the suffering.

I have read about rTMS and Ketamine treatment. None of which is approved and administered everywhere in my country (Sweden) and even if my condition is acute it seems it might not be administered because of how our healthcare is divided.

I am asking, quite humbly so, have I missed any kind of treatments for my condition or have I met the end of the road treatment wise? Is the above mentioned treatments the most invasive and/or effective when you have tried most groups and medications under those groups without avail?

&lt;p&gt;In may I was in a closed psychiatric ward for a month for the risk of suicide. In there I went on several new drugs with little to no effect. I then was administered ECT treatment. Without success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was released because the doctors didnt see any improvements and they couldnt &amp;quot;cure&amp;quot; my affliction in a closed ward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They now want to administer lithium as a treatment. I am not too happy as it seems like a drug that might take more time than I am willing to give for the suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have read about rTMS and Ketamine treatment. None of which is approved and administered everywhere in my country (Sweden) and even if my condition is acute it seems it might not be administered because of how our healthcare is divided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am asking, quite humbly so, have I missed any kind of treatments for my condition or have I met the end of the road treatment wise? Is the above mentioned treatments the most invasive and/or effective when you have tried most groups and medications under those groups without avail?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and I hope you can share experience and or solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"I don't know where to start.

My mom and I are heavily disabled, the only reason we haven't gotten a divorce from my step-dad is because she can't afford meds etc without his financial support.

I've had to endure a literal lifetime of abuse from him - for my mom.

I grew up and my half-brothers would torment me when I was being abused in school or being racially attacked in the neighborhood for just trying to be normal and not physically disabled - I had to come home to them telling me things like spiders were going to crawl in my ears and lay eggs that would kill me.

They would trip me all the time and laugh about it.

Now I'm 33 with life-threatening scoliosis/FM/EDS/Hole in my chest and more.

They were teenagers and I was a child (massive age difference), they still refuse to apologize even though it would ease my CPTSD and BPD.

They cite fallacies like ""I was just a kid"", as stated they were teenagers - I spent my entire life without abusing a child so it's no excuse.

I've been a punching bag for the entire world, and when I try and talk about anything that matters they just ignore me and refuse to ever admit they're wrong - even about empirical facts.

  
Growing up I was constantly indoctrinated using christianity (which is considered child abuse now), in schools teachers called me satan incarnate because I pointed out obvious contradictions.

Principle would force me to strip and use a rugby bat with 3 holes in it ""because it would leave a mark"".

I was forced in detention every day made to copy passages from the bible, always the last to leave school at 4 clock.

I never gave in though.

When I finally left christian schools, the principle told other schools that I was evil and to always keep an eye on me.

I was never once in my life able to escape from abuse (aside from games).

When I was a toddler, my step brother would beat me and which is why I now have life-threatening scoliosis, when I had health insurance the doctor looked at my xrays and said if it gets worse it would ""start effecting major internal organs"".  
  
  
I've had diagnoses since a child, my step-dad always calling me a liar and doctors quacks,  
Meanwhile he says his real son can't work because ""he has a bad back"" - he's just lazy.  
  
 He kept a 15 year lie from my mom, he spent over 50 grand buying his real son a house instead of helping me get the help I needed, and giving him studio equipment and guess what? He still can't afford to take care of himself.

He's in his 40's and still has his dad drive him to skate parks.

I've accepted I'll die soon, either as a result of him or because I have 0 support from ""family"".

My aunt admitted to my mom she saw the abuse, but did nothing - which is despicable, how christian.

  
He's kicked my animals and poisoned my first cat Ozzy.

He's tried killing me twice, once when I was a kid he came inches from running me over - jumped the curb in his truck when I was on my bike on sidewalk.

The other time just years ago, he charged me like a bull because I had it and a mental breakdown and wasn't going to take it anymore.

Needless to say cops listened to him and not me.

I tried telling them he was growing weed, they didn't even check and just assumed I was lying,

After I used 4th grade self defense to get him off me (pivoting breaking hold biting and kicking balls), my mom saw him smiling about strangling me trying to murder me.

He lied in court saying they did everything they could, meanwhile I was sleeping on a broken children's bed where my knees came off the end and had a massive hole in the center.

He's massive compared to me and has over 100 LBS on me, I guess everyone expected to let him kill me.

  
I've told family my whole life but they acted as if I was just making shit up.

  
He lied to my mom about court date, so she wouldn't call him out on his lies, he literally cried on que.  
He didn't even cry when his parents died.

He tried to kill my mom with covid, he KNEW he had covid and what did he do?

1. didn't go to hospital  
2. Didn't sleep in his office (where he has a bed)  
3. Didn't sleep at his sons house.

No, he slept in bed with my mom facing her and she nearly died and had to fight covid for a month.

When it was just him and I in the house, he refused to wear a mask and the entire house smelled like death.

I had to wear 2 masks, seal my vent and keep my window unit running 24/7, opened windows to back yard and front with a fan to pull disease from the house.

Recently he took me to sketchy state health care for a surgical procedure, instead of waiting in the car he was going in side - I told him there's people in there that haven't had a shower in months and are all sick -  
His response ""I have a strong immune system"" (he doesn't), I said it's not about you it's about mom and he didn't say anything.

If I hadn't brough a spare mask she'd be dead right now.

She had heart surgery and is already on deaths door - not that family even cares.  
They say hollow meaningless "" I love You's"" but their actions always dictate otherwise.

  
I have no way to financially support myself, by his design - he could drop the domestic abuse charge (When he tried killing me), but he refuses to - preventing me from getting a job even if I wasn't too sick to work.

  
I have doctor notes saying I shouldn't be working from when I did have health insurance a decade ago, but still can't get disability because of identity politricks.

I've accepted that my mom and I will die soon, I just wanted to set the record straight in case him and his son try to wash the real story.

I have tons of recordings of him abusing us, he just recently gaslit her again blaming everything on HER - 

When he's spent THOUSANDS on virtual racing - which he makes no money from and admits he's terrible but still keep sinking money into instead of getting her the rest of the surgeries she needs.

I might of had a chance of making money streaming again, I was once in a partnership with TGN before 2016, but simply because I didn't have 1000 subs - youtube kicked me out of MY THIRD-PARTY PARTNERSHIP, literally stealing my lively hood and I've been shadowbanned since (can prove this).

I'm at my breaking point and there's no real solution that doesn't involve my mom paying the price for it.

  
Family is useless, they only care when it's convenient.

They all tried to get her to cheat her diet despite needing it for her heart, then would brag about getting her to cheat it - meanwhile her doctor commended me for fighting so hard for her health.

  
If it's one thing I've learned from this ""Family"" is that words are meaningless, if you love someone you consistently prove it with actions - refusing to apologize in your 40's for abusing your little brother shows a complete lack of empathy and responsibility.  
  
He's gaslit me saying I'm not neurodivergent, even though I eventually went to a school for it for a short period where it was the ONLY place I wasn't being abused and was treated like a human.  
  
 He said ""People with neurodivergence can't be potty trained"", just because HIS kids can't be potty trained -  
Showing a complete lack of education and empathy, he doesn't even understand neurodivergence despite his kids being non-verbal.

  
My entire life they abuse me still - by denying me admittance of their behavior and constant excuses, even though it would help my complex PTSD and give me just a LITTLE closure.

They completely ignore me and dismiss me all the time.

I feel like the kafka novel metamorphosis, I am what they made and they aren't even man or adult enough to admit their part in my CPTSD/BPD. 

I admit when I'm wrong, they NEVER do and NEVER have, they never once apologized to me in my entire life.

  
If you ever have your mom dating someone, please vet the absolute hell out of them - I never want what I've had to survive happening to another person EVER.

There's shelters for women, but no such thing exists for abused/battered men - especially if they're disabled.

The first question that originally made me look at everything differently was the fact he asked one of my friends to do underwear photoshoots when she was 16. Also to mention he was running a modeling agency during the time which he still does. She never herself told me what happened but my best friend was dating her at this time and told me himself. This whole situation had me looking at things more closely as I watched our business fall apart. fast forward to when I’m in my 20s and through the years more and more of our female employees left our shop.. there’s been a couple spurts of times where our employees left.

,depression_help,"Ok people of reddit, this is gonna be a looong story but i needed to write it and see if someone could give me advice, is feeling the same or simply wants to read this. 

Just an advice that english is not my first languaje and im a really bad writter (sorry)

Im gonna start heavy because i like to be straight foward. I have a porn issue, a really bad porn issue and for the last years since i was 8 (now im 19) the porn was a pillar of my life, i remember even when i was like 7 i used to have fantasies about seeing woman naked or have sex, even i remember i was having thoughts about how i would like to be tied up or tied someone. I dont know why i had those thoughts or where do they come from but it was a pretty dark part of my past that i ignored for the years to come. (Now i think i should told my parents in time but i was scared and ashamed to tell someone)

But anyways, time past and when i was 8 i discover the internet and you could imagine what happen. The first years where ""normal"" i guess, just vanilla things and nothing more. But since my life became more and more harder, the porn start to become more frequent and that means that i start to watch more and more things i did not even search or like on the first place. 

Thats the thing about porn, you can search something vanilla but there is always gonna be a more fucked up video showing up, and i started to click on that videos. Now all of that just become like a big snowball and this year i saw things that i dont event want to mention (nothing illegal because no) but still pretty fucked up things like kinks i did not even know existed or heavy roleplay about weird things and many more shit.

Im ashamed of this and im in process of change because i want to leave all of that behind, but its more difficult than i expect it. Everyday its just a fight to not see that things and i dont even touch myself but its just the ""feeling"" of seeing it what is bothering me ¿Why does this happen? Because i dont even get hard but some days i just have this ""need"" to see it. 

 Everyday i feel awful and the days i make a progress just get thrown into trash by the next day. Its like im never going to get better and i hate myself for not being capable of such a simple thing.I tried focusing on other things but right now i dont go out to much because i feel tired all day. My life is just sleeping eating and hating myself for not getting better.

The last week i even tried doing sexting on a site just because i was trying to feel something more different, and the woman on the other side just start talking about her weird and dark kinks and i could stop the chat but i just continue to chat with her and when the chat ended i was feeling like throwing up. Honestly i dont know what is wrong with me, every time i take a step foward i screw it up by taking to steps back. 

Today i feel good but im scared to fuck my progress again like i been doing all this months, also i dont know if i should tell my mom about this. Shes in a very stressful moment and is always working since my dad leave us, so i dont want to give her more pressure (Also im very ashamed to tell her about all of this, maybe i can tell her i need therapy or something like that but definitely i dont want to tell her about my problems)

,depression_help,"I (29 yo M) was recently diagnosed with Coronary Heart Disease, my case is not the worst, the fat seems to be blocking only 30% of the artery, but it's enough for me to have some pain in my chest and a little bit of fatigue. I know very well what I should do to fix this, but I honestly have no desire to do so. I also also suffer from chronic migraines and Chronic hives, and taking a bunch of meds for them has taken a toll on me. 

Not only that, but I have tried throughout my life to get my weight in order, and it only made things worse, I am around 255 lbs now, and honestly, I don't think I care enough to get my shit together.Not to mention, my whole damn life is a mess now, an ex-friend of my stole around 20k from me and my wife, and she is probably out of the country by now, there is literally nothing that the government in my country can do to help me out. So now I am just trying to earn my money back, but while at work I noticed that I gave up on trying, I have enough money to maintain my lifestyle anyway, so I am pretty much doing the whole ""quiet quitting"" thing and trying to reduce stress, and this made me realize how much I don't care about any other thing. I don't think I care anymore about trying to find a career in academia, I don't think I wanna have children anymore, neither does my wife.

But what's making me really annoyed is the amount of people in my life that tell me that I should self improve, not give up, go to the gym, study, find a new job, etc. and I already tried all these things with varying degrees of success, but nothing has worked for me, and it's honestly getting really tiresome. Why da hell should I improve anyway? I just wanna be left alone and play video games.

I know that I am being defeatist, but I have been trying to get my shit together for more than 10 years now, and it has only backfired and made things worse. Honestly, just not caring and enjoying life at the moment has made things so much better for me, I don't feel the pressure to lose weight, I don't feel the pressure to have a child, nor do I care if I die.

That's why I find it weird when people go on those self-improvement journeys, in the end, they always create a narrative for themselves that will basically serve as their personal hell, and I tried to do that, but it's not something that I feel ashamed or fearful enough to care about. Like, I tried to go really deep into this whole thing, I really tried to ""improve"" my mental health for almost 10 years or so, by going to many therapists, Shrooms, Ayahuasca, religion, etc., and everything made me come to the same conclusion, that I really don't like myself and I don't care enough.

 Not sure If I am asking for help or just venting. My wife is in the same situation more or less, and it's pretty clear that we feed each other's depression, but we both know that we were already super depressed before we met, honestly, this sort of thing made up more relatable towards each other, so at least we can live peacefully while together, so I guess in a way I am trying to find some help, even though I gave up on myself. It really sucks because I really did try to improve my mental health, but it only backed fired in the long term, so I am kinda scared to try anything at this point.

Honestly, just not caring and enjoying life at the moment has made things so much better for me, I don&amp;#39;t feel the pressure to lose weight, I don&amp;#39;t feel the pressure to have a child, nor do I care if I die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I find it weird when people go on those self-improvement journeys, in the end, they always create a narrative for themselves that will basically serve as their personal hell, and I tried to do that, but it&amp;#39;s not something that I feel ashamed or fearful enough to care about. Like, I tried to go really deep into this whole thing, I really tried to &amp;quot;improve&amp;quot; my mental health for almost 10 years or so, by going to many therapists, Shrooms, Ayahuasca, religion, etc., and everything made me come to the same conclusion, that I really don&amp;#39;t like myself and I don&amp;#39;t care enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure If I am asking for help or just venting. My wife is in the same situation more or less, and it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that we feed each other&amp;#39;s depression, but we both know that we were already super depressed before we met, honestly, this sort of thing made up more relatable towards each other, so at least we can live peacefully while together, so I guess in a way I am trying to find some help, even though I gave up on myself. It really sucks because I really did try to improve my mental health, but it only backed fired in the long term, so I am kinda scared to try anything at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know my situation is kinda bizarre, but I would appreciate any advice from someone that has already &amp;quot;giving up&amp;quot;, maybe on how to cope with day-to-day life?&lt;/p&gt;

We got awake early by the sounds of bombings and explosions which rattled my heart out of my chest.
Some times I lie awake at night and think about just the day before that.
I feel like that was a dream.

I am a different person now, I look different. My weight is reduced to half of what I was.
I was an athlete who played Basket ball and volleyball..and now I can't even get up to eat..our bodies are so weak, with nothing but one meal a day. 

I lost a lot of my best friends during this war..
I met them every day..I felt dead inside..after every news of my friend becoming a martyr..I did not feel I was alive..the memories of our time spent together..rushed through my brain and eyes.


When my father lost the ability to walk due to the occupations bombing..my world shattered even more. He already had high blood pressure diabetes. There were no resources for us to look after him and treat him. No nutritious food.
The painkillers were very mild, and the strong ones. Very expensive.

I’ve had a lesbian thing which helped a lot and was weird to think someone would actually like me, but even then I was too insecure to make it work because I had no boundaries and got a clingy and so on. But now I find guys like don’t want to be friends with me. This one dude made friends with one my other friend and took her to a restaurant when she said it was weird because she barely knew him. But then when he talks to me he’s like I barely know you when I was trying to be nice. Then Ik guys that don’t want to talk to me and avoid me when they see me, like literally walk and turn the other way.

,depression_help,"First of all, lets start with something that I am really grateful for: 

1. My parents and my family
2. How much they have done for me.
3. The friends that I have made

That’s all I could think of right now. 

I don’t know what to write here. But I am sure that I have to change my behaviour and how to handle sadness. 

When I am sad I can think of nothing else. It’s like whatever and whoever is around me doesn’t matter and I only want to talk or hear that persons voice. And that person is, lets say, Jenny. 

She is a very important person in my life. We have known each other for the past 3 years and it’s been around 1.5 years of us being together. There’s huge history between us, I am not gonna bore you with that. But as she told me a while ago, I need to search for some distractions to keep my mind off of things. It’s not like I don’t have things to distract myself but it’s like I don’t make myself do it. I wallow in that freaking shit again and again. 

It’s like I just want to talk to her to get relieved from this pain that I have been going through. I am just using pain as a vague word cause no matter the depth of the situation my only go to thing is talk to her. 

Whenever we fight or have some kind of misunderstanding, all I want to do is clear things out at that moment cause I don’t want her to be thinking about this particular situation after our conversation ends. But it’s not like that for her she just completely shuts herself down and tells that I don’t want to talk no matter what even when I beg to talk to her. 

I feel like I am very emotionally dependent on her and that is a very fucked up. She has people that she can talk to when she is upset or mad about something but I certainly do not. Well, even if I do I don’t go and talk about it cause I feel like no one gives a shit about it and it’s a pain to explain all that shit to the other person. 

I don’t know if I should end it abruptly here but writing all these things have reduced the weight of emotions that I had been feeling. 

If you have any suggestions on what I should do to start the  journey of being emotionally independent then please help me.

,depression_help,"My partner has depression and suicidal tendencies she has attempted 3 times already. This part of her life occured years before I met her. She is medicated now. 

I have clinical depression &amp; anxiety. 
I was feral for decades before getting medicated.

Here is the issue:

My partner is going through all the worst hardest stuff that can happen to a person all at once. Ofc she is having flare ups and is incredibly sad. 
Her vibe and energy is gone. She is becoming a nonverbal husk. She dissociates all the time and won't talk to me. Like I said her bad days are not something I've seen so her acting like this is new to me. 

I get it. This is what mental illness looks like. 

But I am also in a precarious situation in my life and I'm hanging on but just enough. I have been letting friendships, hobbies, and hygiene slip. I try to care for and support my partner daily but I have no spoons left. I feel exhausted and so sad I just want to sleep and seeing her fall apart is killing me. I'm not saying anything to her about feeling sad and tired cause I don't need her to feel worse than she already feels. 

How do others handle hard situations when they are also suffering from mental illness?

,depression_help,"I (25M) have always struggled to fit in. I grew up in a small, conservative, town. I didn’t come from the best home, and once people at school started to learn about this they weren’t as kind as one might think. I was bullied a lot…for having a broken home. This bullying was exacerbated when in junior high I officially joined the LGBT+ community. Overtime I began to lose all my friends that I had, and became the pariah of my school. 

In college (before I dropped out for mental health) was the first time I found myself latching onto someone. I was going through one of the many dark times in my life, and while our meeting was most random, we quickly became best friends. He saw me not only as a person but as a best friend. Unfortunately, I almost as fast as our friendship grew, it fell apart. I grew attached to him and in hindsight probably smothered him with my need for affection. 

This continued for the last many years: each time I grew close to a friend (male or female) to the point we saw one another as a best friend, I’d get clingy, and latch on. Smothering the friendship. These last few years, I have refused to let anyone get that close to me. In that time I learned that it is most likely caused from my lack of feeling validated, loved, and secure; amongst other environmental factors from my past. I thought I was making progress and learning to grow and heal. 

This changed when I moved to a much larger city in a new state. I didn’t know anyone when I moved here. Shortly after moving I gained employment and made a friend. Things were good for a while. I genuinely believe that he was the best friend I have ever had. I’ve been going through yet another pretty dark time in my life, and that never swayed him. I’ve called him crying and in complete mental breakdown and he always responded with grace and genuine concern. 

For the first time ever, instead of ending the friendship full-stop, he told me he needed some time and we could resume being friends after a small break. About a week or so later, while sleep deprived and making poor choices, I approached him and we had a pretty…intense… conversation.  Our conversation ended with him disclosing that he felt as if I constantly latched onto him and he wanted me to figure my shit out before resuming friends so that I would be more comfortable with who I am and more self-secure and with more self-love. 

Over the next few hours after this, I thought hard about what was said and came to a dark realization: this was my pattern. Since this seemed to have become a pattern, I admitted to myself and to him that I don’t know how long it will take me to heal and figure my shit out. I then told him that I thought it best if we weren’t friends anymore. 

We haven’t talked since. 

It’s only been about a month so I’m not in a hurry to be friends again. Maybe it’s just my attachment issues, but I would like to be friends with this said person again one day. But I have a lot of work to do to get there. I feel like I am making progress, and some other friends (whom I have also grown more distant from) have said that from what they can tell, I am making progress to my goal…but I don’t know how to love myself fully or feel secure with who I am…

Anyone have any advice on how to learn to love myself and feel more secure with myself? Thank you in advance.

I have been struggling with depression for years now, and my overall health has had a huge drop. I'm 14 and I struggle with OCD too (both diagnosed, don't come at me). I derealize and I feel like my emotions always get the best of me; yet I still can't put them on display or express myself.

Today I stayed up until 7AM to make a birthday present to my friend online. We usually chat everyday, in the morning, evening, during school etc. So when he messaged me I ofcourse replied, and we ended up talking for a bit. Minutes flew by, and I had to multitask to finish my present ""on time"" (I cannot multitask). And eventually, I sent some pictures of old memories we've shared - as a present. My sleeping schedule has gotten fucked up, since I also have insomnia which I've had for years too. So it's no suprise that I fell asleep some minutes after sending the present.

My father and I have worked hard to try and revert my inaccuracy of a sleeping schedule and woke me up at 11AM. I never eat lunch, since I always sleep through it, and sometimes I miss dinner too.
Time went by and I wasn't hungry at all, no sign of starving, headaches, nothing. I never get sick, or any headaches aswell as no period cramps. My parents are used to me not eating, since pretty much everything in my life is fucked right now. However my parents were insisting on me eating, cause even if they're used to my habits they will still be concerned. (valid). And somehow I ended up in a situation that embarrassed me, so I locked myself up in a room and broke down.

At this point I hadn't eaten at all today, except for the time when I were making my friend a gift. Nor have I been to the toilet which im ALSO used to apart from an hour ago when I stood on the scale, and noticed that I've gone down 1 pound. Not only that, but my bodys been twitching for hours now on end. Nothing hurts, It's just twitching. 

Sorry if I didn't cover up on any important details, or if my grammar was incorrect. English isn't my first language. I apologize if it took long for you to read all this, and if you read it all thank you.
If you have an answer on what it could be, or how to solve it please reply.

Note: I have a hard time talking about my feelings, and I've never opened up to anyone. Nor will I ever do that. I know it sounds stupid, but it physically and mentally hurts me when I try to talk about my wellbeing with people who I know. That's why I've turned to Reddit to see if someone has answers.

At 18 I was kicked out and my survival mode went into stage 2. I had to figure life out by myself with the fear of ending up on the streets. I had 2 jobs in my first year of college and I was hoping I'd see a light at the end of that tunnel.
But that light never came. And I strongly believe it won't ever come. I'm 26 and I feel like I was ""damaged"" in a way that won't allow me to enjoy life anymore. Everyday I struggle to get out of bed and have a normal day. The only thing that's stopping me from ending it all is my close friends and my gf.

My batteries are dead and I simply don&amp;#39;t care anymore, except for the people who would feel terrible if I did what I actually want to do &lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"I’ve become addicted to my own negativity—constantly feeding on dark thoughts and proving to myself that I’m broken. Even though I hate it, I keep going back to it, like I can’t let go of the misery no matter what I do or what I try or what I think or what I think that I think… Advice?

I had an epiphany during a session with my psychiatrist about where my rottenness comes from. All the negativity I've absorbed over the years—the insecurities, the need for validation, and the twisted thinking—comes from my life experiences. My parents constantly screaming and stabbing each other in the back, my mom yelling at me for bad grades and my failures, and the bullying, manipulation, and gaslighting I endured. Even my coworkers and people around me who loathe my weirdness and incompetence. I’ve soaked all of this up like a dirty sock under my bed, filled with seeds of toxicity and self-loathing, wasting away instead of building anything meaningful.

The truth is I thrive on this negativity. I am an embodiment of it—it consumes me. I catch myself thinking like those toxic people I despise. I see people suffering the same loneliness and emptiness I do, and instead of empathizing, I think, “welcome to the pit.” I’ve realized I am a negative force in the world. I want to create things, have friends, maybe even a romantic partner, but I just can't allow myself to.

The fire that should drive me forward is outside of me, burning me alive, and I have to contain it. I can't let it burn others. I can’t love anyone because my self-hatred runs too deep. Everything I do reflects my misery and negativity. I don’t know how to fix it, and honestly, I don’t think I can. I have to want to change, but I’m not sure that I do. I hate the fire burning me, but I can’t give up the warmth it provides. I’ve become someone others can use as a punching bag, and it haunts me every day. Any part of me that I thought was good, like my creativity, is rooted in my need for validation.

For so long, I thought I was the victim, but I now realize I’m part of the problem. I seek help from friends and my psychiatrist, but I’m just wasting their time. I’m stuck in circular logic, tearing myself apart just to put it back together again, keeping the loop going. I argue for the sake of it because that’s all I know how to do with this energy.

I’ve built this idea of being rotten and go out of my way to prove it. I perpetuate it all by myself. I’ve spent hours consuming negativity—Reddit rants, misery, gore sites, and morbid discussions—just to prove a point for no real reason. I see real suffering, like a schizophrenic man lost to his own mind, yet I create my own suffering because somehow I like it. I hate it, but I love it, and I can’t love anything else.

,depression_help,"I'm (m)23, been working in retail stores since 2019 when I finished HS. I have been addicted to smoking weed heavily since I was 14. Just recently I finally beat it. It's been hard but I did it and I won't go back for sure this time. I've grown and learned alot in the last 5 yrs and even thru highschool it caused alot of problems for me and held me back alot. I've worked for 3 different retail stores in the past 5yrs and I worked my ass off and was always 1 of the hardest workers in the room my managers would agree.
      This past August I got my shit together. I do believe you get another year wiser if you allow yourself to learn. I sobered up and got in shape by hitting the gym hard. I wanted more and put in a ton of effort and discipline to get where I wanted.
     I told my family and girlfriend I'm done with these retail stores and I wanna try something new and challenging so I aimed at applying at Discount Tire. 1st I had to get clean. I took the month of August to do a 180° and I did it. I tried so hard and came so far in a short time and on Sept 1st. I got the Job. Now I've been here over 2 weeks. 
       I don't really like it at all. I've picked up real fast on most of the job and I've worked my ass off everyday I show up. I improve and get a little faster with each eay that goes by but I honestly don't like it. I don't see myself here for very long. It's just not for me. I still have more to learn and until I become well rounded I'm gonna stick it out.
    I've always been tough and the kind of guy to stick it out and figure things out when I'm stuck. I trained MMA for 2 years in HS and competed in amateur boxing and Muay thai bouts during that time. That's my passion honestly. My dream is to be involved in the fight industry in some way. Commentating, fight managing, fighter promoter, or referee. I'd like to be the next Eddie Hearn, Dana White, or Joe Rogan/Jon Anik. I love the sport and I'd do it with a passion, I'd never work a day in my life. 
      To finish off, this job at DT is really rough on my body. I want to take care of my health, my body and find a rewarding career with work/ life balance. I want to be able to provide more for my GF and my parents. That's why I made this change, I did it for Me but also for them.

I’ve suffered so much I dont care for my loved ones anymore. I feel like there’s no hope because it seems like every day gets worse and worse, and I don’t know how that’s possible because I feel like I’ve already hit rock bottom. Somehow, the hole just keeps getting deeper and darker.
It’s been nearly two years, and I’m scared it’ll keep going until adulthood, and I don’t know if I have the strength to keep going. And even if I do, my mental health will just get worse and worse, and eventually, I’ll lose interest in life and kill myself. I just wish I had someone who would understand or someone to talk to. I don’t want a friend, I just want someone. I know some will say, “You’re not alone in this,” and yeah, I know I’m not the only one suffering from depression, but that doesn’t make me feel any better. There’s no one I can talk to.

,depression_help,"I don’t know how help my Husband.  
He is spiraling into one of the worst depressions, and I cannot save him.

Over the past maybe year, he has slowly been getting darker.  
He is so angry, everything sets him off. The weather, the laundry, the dog, the house, the time of day.

Things have escalated in the past 6 months. He left his job of 8 years, as he was miserably unhappy. I really hoped this would help get him in the right head space. Well, he is into his new job now and it is not a great workplace but pays well. He is miserable still.

He has completely given up. When he is On Call and his phone is dying or not near him and I tell him to charge it, or find it, he goes “whatever” “who cares” “fuck them”

He works from home and doesn’t really work anymore, just plays games saying he deserves the break and that it is fine. I do work, but if he loses his job I cannot afford the bills alone.

He won’t go to bed, he won’t sleep, he has stopped caring for his personal hygiene, he rages over every little thing.  
Honestly, I believe the lack of sleep is starting to affect his mind, he keeps remembering conversations wrong, dipping out mid conversation, and when I ask WTF he says he didn’t do that and has no memory of it.  
  
I love this man more than anything and have supported him the best way I know how. I am trying to take him out, do fun activities, do all the chores, the only thing I can’t do is carry the laundry up and down the stairs, and when asked he rages. I walk on eggshells around him.

When confronted about any of this he says ""he must just go to the bottom"", or ""he has to fail"", ""he is going to just sink into it"". ""He is going to let it happen and give up on it all"".

He doesn’t want out, but I can’t live with this anymore. We have had many conversations; he tries really hard for a day or two and then something upsets him, and it is back to anger and treating me like shit.  
He has really bad SADs and winter is coming, he always struggles in winter but he is going into it this time in such a dark place. I am honestly scared for him.

He doesn’t believe in medication, or therapy, or really anything that can help.  
I have struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life and this man has seen me through some of the ugliest times and was always my rock. I feel weak and like I am failing him, my mental health is starting to take a toll, and I just don’t know where to go from here or how much longer I can last.

,depression_help,"So after a month of taking Luvox (fluvoxamine) I think I was having mild serotonin syndrome. I started on 100 mg and my anxiety increased exponentially to the point where I left an event that would have been joyful previously. I sent my psych NP a message and my therapist. 

After telling the psych NP that my irritability increased enough to where my mom didn’t want to ask me questions about her care because she had a brain tumor that affects her memory and that my anxiety and restlessness was out of control she increased the Luvox to 200 mg. Within four days I had a panic attack, emotional blunting or depersonalization (hard to tell which it was in hindsight because I wasn’t keeping extensive notes). She agreed with me that my dose was too high and decreased it to 175. After a few days I was still feeling emotional blunting so I went against NP orders and decreased my dose by 25 mg so I was at 150 mg. I talked to a PA about what is a safe weening schedule so I didn’t have withdrawals and they said I can decrease by 50 mg every 4-7 days but to stay safe it should be 7 so I didn’t just pick a dose to ween to and didn’t just look on the internet. I got medical clearance just not from my psych NP but my PA. 

I had a major panic attack, high resting heart rate and palpitations, and feeling like someone was sitting on my chest. Immediately sent a message to the NP but it was the weekend. We set up an appointment and she sent me to the emergency department for an ekg which turned into a CT because something that might indicate a blood clot was high(D dimer). All was fine I went home and missed my nightly dose of Luvox. 

The next day I had a breakdown after taking my morning dose late because I got home late and went to work late. NP said to decrease to 150 which I told her I already did and explained everything but she wasn’t happy which I understand. She prescribed an extended release but the pharmacy didn’t have it and then my insurance wouldn’t cover it. This again was on a weekend so I talked to the PA again after another instance of high resting heart rate and restlessness. My PA is a friend so she is there for me 24/7. Mainly I run things by her to see if I should go to the emergency department or just make a new appointment and if she thinks my logic is sound. We decided to decrease to 100 mg since it had been 7 days and I asked my NP if I could get the immediate release instead of the extended release and put in a call to my PCP to take over medication management until I got a new psych. NP office said I needed a new appointment to get a different med. I told them they were stupid to ask for three appointments in 7 days. 

So the main point is my PA friend and I think I was having slight serotonin syndrome and was hoping the ER or Psych NP would come to that conclusion but neither did. My mom now says I’m more like myself after being on 100 mg for four days. 

Should I take this to the NP’s boss? File a complaint with someone else? My PCP prescribed Xanax for a panic attack until I could see a new psych and I felt better after taking half. Turns out that is one of the treatments along with things to decrease heart rate if it is too high. Mine wasn’t what they consider dangerous it was just high for me. My blood pressure was “normal” but high for me so they couldn’t give me anything for that either.

,depression_help,"Hey everyone, 

How do I stop wanting to die? I’ve had a shit life. My step dad spent years molesting me, my first boyfriend ever was killed (with his sister) in a car crash after leaving my house, both of my parents have kicked me out at least once. It’s been rough. I’ve always thought that I just needed to get to the better part of my life and then I would be good. I’ve always had something to look forward to I guess. 

Now, I live with my fiancé who is so sweet. We’ve been together for 5 years and I’ve been looking forward to getting married and being together. We finally live together and we have a wedding date in 6 months, I graduated college, I did all the things and I feel like everything should be falling into place. 

But I still feel like I want to die. I look around and the house is a mess and it’s my fault. He’s upset because he’s having to clean a lot and because I’m tired all the time and it makes me feel so bad. I can’t control my temper with him even though he is truly so so kind 99% of the time. I feel like he expects a lot from me because he knows my potential, but I am so goddamn overwhelmed by that potential and the fact that I’m never fucking living up. 

It’s also because I haven’t honestly told him I’m struggling with these thoughts again. He helped the last time I needed it, but that was like 2 years ago and I’ve been so much better since then. I don’t want him to know that I’m so done. It feels worse than last time I was suicidal, it feels more final and like this is all I will ever be. 

I know all the things. I’ve done fucking years of therapy. I know that my siblings need me to stay. I know I have a puppy. But it just doesn’t feel like enough this time. I don’t want to kill myself. Please help me because I can’t let other people down. I fucking hate that the only reason I have to live is to make other people happy. Fuck.

However, recently things just keep going downhill over and over again. 

First we lost my family business while I was studying abroad...I had nothing to do with it...my elder brothers (14 and 15 years older were managing it).

I do my best I started from a small job, worked my way up, shifted jobs to something that I like...but I get exploited every step of the way. My employers also take advantage of me being nice and don't pay me for months and the work life balance is none! (Considered normal in the film industry) 

My family also fell a part during the financial crisis that we are still going through, the girl I confided in and fell in love with also crushed my heart, my dog just recently went missing, and some people at my work place consistently try to bully me, I will have no home soon as the family separates and my mother (who just got a bypass surgery 2/3 months ago) will be living with me, for which I am grateful.

,depression_help,"I have been taking Effexor for 7 years but I have scary side effects. 

  
Last year I tried coming off it and over the year I was off it, I would be super nervous where it affects my daily life. I don't know if this is a withdrawal effect that will go away OR if this is just how I am without an antidepressant. Does anyone know? My mental health was barely hanging on by a thread so I went back on it. 

The side effects when I'm on it:

My back hurts and I can't breathe, it feels like my lung is going to collapse and I read Effexor causes chronic lung/kidney disease so I think that is what it is.

I am more forgetful which I never was before. The other day I got into a fender bender b/c I didn't realize a car was parked behind me. I'm afraid this is causing brain damage. 

I also had heart palpitation one night where I woke up to my heart thumping strongly in my chest. It was scary.

  
When I came off of it:

I would stare off into space where I was zoned out, this had never happened before Effexor, it was just so strange.

My body felt super heavy like I couldn't move or get out of bed.

Like 3 times it felt like my mind was blank and I was going to go crazy or snap. Again this never happened before effexor.

I take 37.5mg every third day and my feet will get like a painful pinching sensation like my blood is clogged there idk how to describe it. 

One other thing, I noticed being in the sun helps (vitamin D) so I might try adding that. I don't know if it will cure my nervousness but it helps.

It also caused me to gain like 30lbs. My psychiatrist tries to help me but I feel like he doesn't understand. He has suggested trying a different antidepressant but I'm afraid of the side effects from those. Any advice b/c I'm not sure what to do?
