 i’ve had many different obsessions and chronically ruminate and it started when i was 6 after my cat unexpectedly died. 

my fear of death is so strong it prevents me from actually living my one shot at life. i recognize how stupid this is, and that i should just live my life, but guys this runs so fucking deep im a little unsure i can break free from this. 

since i turned 21 this year, this fear that was already causing me distress increased tenfold. i actually have lost any ability to be a normal human being. it sits in my head chronically now that im going to die and that ive lived about 1/4 of my life already. 

i’m sorry this is so depressing. being born just feels like a curse especially with this fear. i’ve been greatly suicidal for a large portion of my life yet i know deep down i could never do it. if someone says ANYTHING about death, time, getting old, etc. honestly it could be anything, bam, the rumination kicks in and i’m going to find somewhere to cry/have a panic attack.

i have more i could say, but i honestly shouldn’t, for the sake of my sanity and also not to continue triggering myself.

,Anxiety,"After 3 weeks of exposure therapy, I'm amazed at how well it actually works - definitely not the myth I initially thought it was. Before starting, I was in a miserable state for over 2 years, dealing with this awful chest tightness near my heart that made me feel like I was dying. I used to think fighting and ignoring these feelings was the solution, but that only made everything worse, leading to mini panic attacks that eventually became major ones. I was honestly close to quitting my job and going all-in on therapy and medication.

Then I discovered exposure therapy, and things started changing. I learned to listen to and observe my anxiety instead of fighting it, understanding it's just my brain's protective mechanism - that ancient fight-or-flight response trying to keep me safe. The problem is, in our modern world, simple things like drinking coffee, experiencing a faster heart rate, or even meeting people can trigger this response. My personal triggers include coffee, cigarettes, increased heart rate, muscle twitches, and getting high AF due to bad experiences with drugs.

Here's what I'm curious about from others who've done this therapy: 

Do you experience that intense feeling of being detached from reality like DPDR but stronger and more constant ? 

and that weird phase where you temporarily lose hope and question life's meaning?

 And does anyone else get that strange mix of calmness and discomfort while practicing anxiety acceptance? Would love to hear about your experiences with these symptoms during the exposure therapy process.

What will it be like most likely? Is religion likely to be false and if so how can I be comfortable with eternal nothingness?

How do I differentiate real life and dreams?

,Anxiety,"I’ve been able to manage my anxiety quite well the past year or so but I just got hired at a new job and it has become super crippling. I work in kitchens and this place is really nice, I think my anxiety started because I wanted to do well but now I am a complete wreck at work. The first shift I could barely remember anything and was shaking so badly, I was basically having a panic attack the whole time. Second shift was better and I spent the rest of the week after that studying for my next shift. 
I came in yesterday for my third shift feeling much more prepared but then they had hired someone else and put me on an easier station. I was pretty devastated and it sent me into a spiral the whole shift because I’m pretty sure they are looking to get rid of me already. I also just got thrown into a place where I knew nothing again, all my studying was for nothing and I suddenly went from feeling somewhat prepared to completely overwhelmed and blindsided. Yesterday I was actually having a panic attack quietly the whole night. I was shaking so badly I actually had to apologize and get them to cut something for me at one point because I couldn’t do any fine knife skills. The girl who was training me was so annoyed with me because I couldn’t understand what she was saying and kept having to ask her to repeat herself. I also couldn’t remember anything she would tell me and just felt like a huge nuance the entire night. I got back home and sobbed so much. I felt like relapsing into SH after not doing it for over 3 years. I’m not sure if I can go back today.

I work in kitchens and this place is really nice, I think my anxiety started because I wanted to do well but now I am a complete wreck at work. The first shift I could barely remember anything and was shaking so badly, I was basically having a panic attack the whole time. Second shift was better and I spent the rest of the week after that studying for my next shift. 
I came in yesterday for my third shift feeling much more prepared but then they had hired someone else and put me on an easier station. I was pretty devastated and it sent me into a spiral the whole shift because I’m pretty sure they are looking to get rid of me already. I also just got thrown into a place where I knew nothing again, all my studying was for nothing and I suddenly went from feeling somewhat prepared to completely overwhelmed and blindsided. Yesterday I was actually having a panic attack quietly the whole night. I was shaking so badly I actually had to apologize and get them to cut something for me at one point because I couldn’t do any fine knife skills. The girl who was training me was so annoyed with me because I couldn’t understand what she was saying and kept having to ask her to repeat herself. I also couldn’t remember anything she would tell me and just felt like a huge nuance the entire night. I got back home and sobbed so much. I felt like relapsing into SH after not doing it for over 3 years. I’m not sure if I can go back today. I really want to, and if I don’t I know I will regret it, but if I do go there’s a chance I will need to leave mid shift or I will come home feeling like hurting myself again. I don’t know what to do.

,Anxiety,"I swear I’m not a delusional crazy person …. But I have anxiety around germs, poison, drugs, food poisoning, toxins particularly when it comes to ingesting food. 

When I wash my dishes I scrub every dish twice, once with a scouring pad, and then once with a really frothy sponge with soap mixed with Pinesol. Then I let my dishes sit on the counter all soapy while I wash the rest of them. Then I rinse them all at the end and let them dry. Does this sound overboard ? 

If something has been in the fridge past two days, I won’t eat it. Sometimes I overcook my meat because I’m afraid of not cooking it fully. 

Today my boyfriend came home with a box of chocolates, I had about two out of the box. I asked him where he bought it. He said he found them in a shopping cart by a bus loop. I immediately got anxiety like bad anxiety, I studied the box which looked sort of tampered with. He told me he dropped the box, which I was worried he just said that to calm me down. 

In my head I’m like “what if some person poisoned these chocolates, and left them out to hurt someone” because people can be cruel and weird like that. I’ve seen videos of people licking ice cream and putting it back in the store. What if someone did something terrible to these. 

Okay, I know this sounds ridiculous. And I know the chances of someone doing that is slim, and most likely someone forgot the chocolates in the cart when they were getting on the bus. But that little part of my brain is like “WHAT IF” !!!

,Anxiety,"Trigger Warning: Politics, Specifically Social Politics, are mentioned heavily. I'm sorry if I happen to bring the mood down for some.

Hello, r/anxiety. I normally don't post on Reddit, since I see social media sites as anxiety farming- but I need somewhere to talk, and new perspectives.

I am young, nearly an adult. I'm white, I'm questioning my gender identity (born a guy and mostly identify as one), and I live in the United States of America. As the years have gone on, not only have I become more aware of what goes on around me- but I've become aware of politics. I desperately wish I didn't have to.

No matter what happens, what will happen, and what could- I'm afraid of my future. I've been told I'm someone who won't be effected by it, due to my outward appearance and the fact I live in a generally accepting and good state. But even the anxiety of what could happen to people around me keeps me up at night. I worry about what'll happen to all the people who aren't as lucky as me, in worse places than me- what they'll have to go through. Or worse, that it'll be so bad everyone but me will be affected. I have so many friends, and even just people I know of that I think about every night before going to sleep. I don't want to lose them. I don't want them to suffer, like they very well could. There are people I don't even know who I worry about, all the hypothetical people who exist out there. Who could be rounded up, shipped out of the country, taken into prisons- or even just flat out killed. Even if I'm fine, I'll have to live knowing that everyone else wasn't. That I couldn't do anything to stop it, I can't even vote yet. Will I even be allowed to go to college, if Public Schooling takes a massive hit? Will I still be able to enjoy foreign content that could  be banned in the next few years? Will my mother and I still be able to live in relative comfort, if prices go up and living spaces decrease? Will all my friends suffer in the same way?

I want to help them. Even if I can't act, I want them to have hope. That things can get better, since I believe that they always can- and will. But I don't want them to have to go through such potential hardships at all. I wish people got along. I believe in Friendship and it's powers, but people everywhere give up on those ideas. I'll never stop believing in Teamwork to make a Dreamwork- but I also want to stop being so anxious. Part of me wonders if I should even care this much about it, then I remember how many people are at stake- the rights of Women, Minorities, LGBTQ+- really anyone who doesn't have the benefits I do. The Benefits I despise to the core. I remember what I can't do. And what I can't stop.

I love everyone, even people who hate. I wish they could do better. I wish I could help more. The best I can think to do is be accepting, and treat everyone as they should be- equal. Which I've always done, for as long as I can remember. I just hope that's enough to bring light back to someone's day while they're in a rough spot. Even if my anxiety doesn't stop. 

I'm sorry if this comes across like someone with privilege complaining about problems that people in worse spots wished they had to deal with. Today was really bad with anxiety- and I needed somewhere to speak up. In the hopes that I'd learn from different perspectives.

I&amp;#39;m sorry if I happen to bring the mood down for some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;a href=""/r/anxiety""&gt;r/anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. I normally don&amp;#39;t post on Reddit, since I see social media sites as anxiety farming- but I need somewhere to talk, and new perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am young, nearly an adult. I&amp;#39;m white, I&amp;#39;m questioning my gender identity (born a guy and mostly identify as one), and I live in the United States of America. As the years have gone on, not only have I become more aware of what goes on around me- but I&amp;#39;ve become aware of politics. I desperately wish I didn&amp;#39;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what happens, what will happen, and what could- I&amp;#39;m afraid of my future. I&amp;#39;ve been told I&amp;#39;m someone who won&amp;#39;t be effected by it, due to my outward appearance and the fact I live in a generally accepting and good state. But even the anxiety of what could happen to people around me keeps me up at night. I worry about what&amp;#39;ll happen to all the people who aren&amp;#39;t as lucky as me, in worse places than me- what they&amp;#39;ll have to go through. Or worse, that it&amp;#39;ll be so bad everyone but me will be affected. I have so many friends, and even just people I know of that I think about every night before going to sleep. I don&amp;#39;t want to lose them. I don&amp;#39;t want them to suffer, like they very well could. There are people I don&amp;#39;t even know who I worry about, all the hypothetical people who exist out there. Who could be rounded up, shipped out of the country, taken into prisons- or even just flat out killed. Even if I&amp;#39;m fine, I&amp;#39;ll have to live knowing that everyone else wasn&amp;#39;t. That I couldn&amp;#39;t do anything to stop it, I can&amp;#39;t even vote yet. Will I even be allowed to go to college, if Public Schooling takes a massive hit? Will I still be able to enjoy foreign content that could  be banned in the next few years? Will my mother and I still be able to live in relative comfort, if prices go up and living spaces decrease? Will all my friends suffer in the same way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to help them. Even if I can&amp;#39;t act, I want them to have hope. That things can get better, since I believe that they always can- and will. But I don&amp;#39;t want them to have to go through such potential hardships at all. I wish people got along. I believe in Friendship and it&amp;#39;s powers, but people everywhere give up on those ideas. I&amp;#39;ll never stop believing in Teamwork to make a Dreamwork- but I also want to stop being so anxious. Part of me wonders if I should even care this much about it, then I remember how many people are at stake- the rights of Women, Minorities, LGBTQ+- really anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t have the benefits I do. The Benefits I despise to the core. I remember what I can&amp;#39;t do. And what I can&amp;#39;t stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love everyone, even people who hate. I wish they could do better. I wish I could help more. The best I can think to do is be accepting, and treat everyone as they should be- equal. Which I&amp;#39;ve always done, for as long as I can remember. I just hope that&amp;#39;s enough to bring light back to someone&amp;#39;s day while they&amp;#39;re in a rough spot. Even if my anxiety doesn&amp;#39;t stop. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"hi everyone, hope you’re all doing alright today. 
this is my first post/introduction, and some info about me - ive had GAD quite literally since before i could remember. 

i remember when i was younger id stay up awake at night obsessing over death and fearful that me or my loved ones would die in some kind of bizarre way. meds and therapists never helped me - i still don’t know why to this day, ive always felt incurable.

my anxiety calmed (for the most part) for many years, though my paranoia has made a comeback more recently. right now, im in the worst spot ive ever been in. 

i wake up with anxiety and get hella physical symptoms now. (dpdr, nausea, pressure headaches, dizziness, aches, blurry vision, you name it) i notice when i distract myself, it gets better for a little bit until I inevitably slip back into my own thoughts and fall back into the anxious cycle. 
i went on a trip and i couldnt even enjoy it. i was too stuck in my own head worrying about every little thing. 
ive been having panic attacks like crazy. ive tried breathing techniques, journaling, cutting out caffeine, regulating my nervous system, all that fun stuff.

i can feel myself slowly healing but as soon as i think i am, my physical symptoms come right back for vengeance. it feels like everytime i even think about them they come back stronger than before. 

i feel like i may never truly heal. am i bound to be stuck in this cycle of constantly distracting myself until even that inevitably fails and i fall back to my worries? i feel trapped in my own mind. 

how do I stop thinking about it? how do i not have anxiety about my own anxiety (which is what im pretty sure makes it always come back so strong).

,Anxiety,"is it anxiety? is it derealisation? what’s wrong with me? 

Hi everybody! 

I am a 21 year old girl, currently studying in Amsterdam.

To give a bit of information to my story : 
For the past 4 years I smoked weed almost everyday, with a tolerance break of 6 months in between. 
I never had a bad trip, I never greened out or never had any anxiety from smoking weed. 
Overall I wouldn’t consider myself a very anxious person either.

BUT

Last friday when I was about to pick up my boyfriend from Uni, I decided to smoke a little joint by myself in the city. Nothing abnormal, as I had done that many times prior. 
This time it wasn’t pleasant at all. I felt as if I had lost control over my legs, I felt dizzy and as if I couldn’t get any air. I had to sit down on a bench for 45 minutes to calm myself down. 

After that experience I smoked once, which was fully fine. The second time at home I had a panic attack - again. Since then I’ve been quite traumatised and haven’t smoked weed, out of fear the same things would happen again.

Now yesterday, a week after my first bad trip in the city, my partner and I had planed a date night in the city. We rented a car and I was driving. 
When we were looking for parking I had the first 'wave' of nervousness. Sounds seemed distorted, my vision was spinning and blurry. I parked the car in a safe space and we took a walk in the city. It was packed and smelled of weed everywhere. That’s when I was really uneasy.
My boyfriend mentioned that I was pale, cold and really sweaty.
It wasn’t getting better even though I tried to calm myself, so we had to go home. 

Today I felt better, but the nervousness and panic haven’t quite left me. I feel high even though i’m clearly not, I feel dizzy and my head feels in the clouds. It feels like I’m losing control of myself and my surroundings. Breathing exercises help but aren’t effective enough.

I am just genuinely scared, that I fucked up my mind with weed and won’t be able to handle myself anymore. I read that weed withdrawals can lead to hyper anxiety - which would make sense as I have been 'clean' for a week now.
But going out by myself makes me uncomfortable and feel unsafe, especially as I am not native to the city I live in. 

Does anyone have an idea of what I have or proper advice for me to live my life to the fullest again? How long do these feelings last and what can I do to stop them or ease them out? Do I need a special psychiatrist?

Being very new to anxiety and panic attacks I am quite scared of how it is going to develop. 

Thank you for any help!! xx

&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a 21 year old girl, currently studying in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a bit of information to my story : 
For the past 4 years I smoked weed almost everyday, with a tolerance break of 6 months in between. 
I never had a bad trip, I never greened out or never had any anxiety from smoking weed. 
Overall I wouldn’t consider myself a very anxious person either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last friday when I was about to pick up my boyfriend from Uni, I decided to smoke a little joint by myself in the city. Nothing abnormal, as I had done that many times prior. 
This time it wasn’t pleasant at all. I felt as if I had lost control over my legs, I felt dizzy and as if I couldn’t get any air. I had to sit down on a bench for 45 minutes to calm myself down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that experience I smoked once, which was fully fine. The second time at home I had a panic attack - again. Since then I’ve been quite traumatised and haven’t smoked weed, out of fear the same things would happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now yesterday, a week after my first bad trip in the city, my partner and I had planed a date night in the city. We rented a car and I was driving. 
When we were looking for parking I had the first &amp;#39;wave&amp;#39; of nervousness. Sounds seemed distorted, my vision was spinning and blurry. I parked the car in a safe space and we took a walk in the city. It was packed and smelled of weed everywhere. That’s when I was really uneasy.
My boyfriend mentioned that I was pale, cold and really sweaty.
It wasn’t getting better even though I tried to calm myself, so we had to go home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I felt better, but the nervousness and panic haven’t quite left me. I feel high even though i’m clearly not, I feel dizzy and my head feels in the clouds. It feels like I’m losing control of myself and my surroundings. Breathing exercises help but aren’t effective enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am just genuinely scared, that I fucked up my mind with weed and won’t be able to handle myself anymore. I read that weed withdrawals can lead to hyper anxiety - which would make sense as I have been &amp;#39;clean&amp;#39; for a week now.
But going out by myself makes me uncomfortable and feel unsafe, especially as I am not native to the city I live in. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Hey everyone, this month has been extremely straining on my mental health, which has caused a spurt in my anxiety. I spent 20 minutes outside in the cold; trying to get some fresh air, calm myself down and sit with my symptoms. During that time I wrote something I would have loved to hear in that moment.

If you’re here reading this, maybe you’re in the middle of that health anxiety spiral, or maybe you’re just looking for some reassurance you can come back to whenever things feel overwhelming. I wanted to write this as a reminder, for you and all of us dealing with anxiety in any fashion, that you’re not alone!

Health anxiety can be incredibly draining. It can feel like we’re stuck in an endless cycle of “what if” thoughts, worries, and constant checking. It can be isolating, especially when those around us may not fully understand the intensity of our fears.

Anxiety doesn’t define us, It’s something we face. It doesn’t take away our worth or strength. It doesn’t make us crazy, delusional or sensitive; it makes us human, who are experiencing human symptoms, emotions and feelings. Even though it can feel all-consuming, you have the power to keep going, and bit by bit, learn to live alongside these feelings. Healing doesn’t mean you never feel anxious again; it means we grow stronger in responding to it, and that journey deserves patience, compassion and a pat on the back.

For Those in the Middle of a Panic Attack:

If you’re reading this in the middle of a panic attack, I want you to know that this will pass. I know it feels unbearable right now, but this moment is temporary, and you’re stronger than you realize. Try to take one slow breath at a time, even if it feels difficult. Remind yourself that these symptoms are not a sign of something dangerous; they’re just the body’s response to anxiety. Yes, your symptoms are real, and yes, you are so incredibly strong!

Focus on small things around you. Try to find one thing you can touch, see, smell, and hear. Try splashing cold water on your face. Repeat these words; “I am safe, I am not in danger, I will make it!”, as many times as you need. These steps may feel small, but they can help ease the panic, bit by bit. You’ve made it through every other panic attack you’ve had, and you will make it through this one too.

Whenever you’re struggling, know that you have a whole community here who truly gets it. We have been there, some are still here, and we get it! You’re seen, you’re heard, and we’re all here to support each other. Together, we’ll keep moving forward. One day, one moment at a time, we’ll pull through!

,Anxiety,"This is going to sound really weird so bare with me, a few weeks ago I had appetite issues off and on, some anxiety too obviously, and it all element full circle when I noticed my pants felt a little loose one day, and when I weighed myself then I was 148 lbs, which is only two lbs less than my standard I've been for like years. I measured my high waist which is still around 31 inches, and my hips/butt which is 43 inches, these measurements are my normal, maybe like 1/12th less than my normal I guess. My pants that I can never button usually without sucking in and pulling, now I can button more easily, but my waist and hips are the same measurements as before? I've weighed myself once every morning for the last two weeks, in the morning, after going to the bathroom, before food, same spot, and naked, I've been consistently between 147-150 back and forth, my last weigh this morning being 149. My waist and hips are still 31 and 43, but my pants still 'fit' better. I noticed yesterday that my belly button looked different, like, softer. I sat down and sucked in my stomach and saw a horizontal crease fold in at my belly button area, effectively pulling in my button and creating a crease there at my lower waist, I freaked out cause I don't think I've noticed that or been able to do that. Then I started meticulously inspecting my body and noticed I have a friggen FUPA now, like, that area looks more 'saggy'  and 'fatter' than I remember, and a crease fold of skin at my bikini lines at certain positions like sitting or crouching. When looking up all this, it said it can be caused by ""significant weight loss in a short amount of time"". Now I'm paranoid thats what's happening to me, even though both of my scales, and my measuring tape, say nothing's really changed but my friggen clothes say the opposite. Also, no one has asked me if I'm losing weight, and my bf says I look exactly the same, even when looking at older photos of me from months ago for reference.

,Anxiety,"Hi Everyone, so I’ve always been an anxious person, but recently I’ve been thinking about things that normal people may think are “issues” but very minor, I take these issues and hyperfixate on them and think the worst is going to happen, but all while doing that I also think simultaneously “that is silly, that would never happen.” 

As an example, I have some trees that are leaning, but healthy in my yard and I got fixated on them thinking “what if it falls on my neighbors.” “They will sue me” “I can’t afford court” , but at the same time I know they are healthy trees, I know in Florida it wouldn’t be my fault, and also my neighbors are very nice. I know it’s an irrational thought, but I can’t keep from thinking these doom situations.

Is there something that causes this issue biologically? I’ve been on wellbutrin on and off my whole life, but have been off of it for afew months now. 

Also, is there a word for this kind of anxiety? It seems like when I resolve an issue in my head, I go onto something else and all the sudden it’s DOOM about that situation too.

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone. About 10 years ago I started taking Lexapro. I was too little to remember why, and part of me honestly doesn’t think I should have been prescribed it. Around 2022, I realized that I had started to forget doses, but I didn’t feel any different. I had a girlfriend, a job, a car, life was good, but I didn’t feel happy, or sad, or anything really. 

Sexual dysfunction was also a huge problem now, it took forever for anything sexual to happen, and when it did it was underwhelming at best. My girlfriend was incredibly understanding but it still eats you up on the inside and makes you feel awful.

About 4 months ago, she left, three years of my life and I couldn’t even cry. I talked to my psychiatrist and decided to quit. I tapered off over a month, and I am so glad. Withdrawal was hell, I was confined to my dorm for days on end, but it was worth it. About 5 weeks after stopping it felt like every emotion that I had blunted over the past decade flew out, and it was wonderful. I cried and cried over the breakup, even though it was a month late. 

On lexapro, I genuinely couldn’t see my future. I just didn’t care about anything because nothing I did felt rewarding, and part of that lead to the failure of the best relationship I will ever have. But I have forgiven myself. 

My anxiety still exists, but I have learned ways to manage it and cope. I know this is a strange thing to say, but I don’t mind a little anxiety sometimes, it’s my reminder that I am alive, and that I really care about the people I love and things I do.

Above all, find what works for you. Talk to your doctor if your medication isn’t working anymore. I was scared because I had been on it for so long that I genuinely thought I had no other options. 

Above all, please don’t wait until you loose something that you can’t replace like I did.

&lt;p&gt;On lexapro, I genuinely couldn’t see my future. I just didn’t care about anything because nothing I did felt rewarding, and part of that lead to the failure of the best relationship I will ever have. But I have forgiven myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My anxiety still exists, but I have learned ways to manage it and cope. I know this is a strange thing to say, but I don’t mind a little anxiety sometimes, it’s my reminder that I am alive, and that I really care about the people I love and things I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, find what works for you. Talk to your doctor if your medication isn’t working anymore. I was scared because I had been on it for so long that I genuinely thought I had no other options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, please don’t wait until you loose something that you can’t replace like I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still healing to this day, and I’m not sure that I ever will, but I have more hope now than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

I was diagnosed today with Mild Depression and Moderate anxiety. I have an anger issue as well, which is why I was prescribed lexapro today (5mg). I have never been someone to I guess understand or agree with medication, but if it’s going to help my anger management and in-turn save my relationship, I’m willing to try anything. I’m worried about the side effects. My psychiatrist said to say it no more than two hours before bed and not past 9pm. 

I don’t feel right now that I need medication, of course my Drs. feel otherwise, but I’m not worried that if I take it, I will always feel reliant on it and then I will never be able to get off of it.

I have been dealing with GAD for at least a decade. Not being able to open texts or emails and I haven't worked for about 5 years due to related anxiety. 

I am overwhelmed by everything and I really need to try some new solutions cos I can't keep living this way where I'm so fragile 🙁

I have tried therapy EMDR TMS shrooms, transformational breathing, exercise, meditation courses etc, antidepressants, hypnosis.

Anti ds = Effexor Prozac brintellix very unhelpful. 

I'm interested in exposure therapy but I'm yet to find someone really good at it has anyone tried it or can recommend what to look for in a provider? 

If anyone knows providers online I am happy to do zoom for anything!

I am happy to hear about the above again of anything worked for you or there's a specific provider? Or modality or framework you used? 

I think the best for mehave been exercise and shrooms.  

Worst has been meditation.

,Anxiety,"Hi guys,

I’ve been really in my head for the last 2/3 months. So me M20 and F20, we matched on hinge in July and we started to speak and we clicked. Fast forward to August, we book oasis for next year and Bakar in November. Then I booked Copenhagen for a weekend for us after bakar.

But recently, we have been seeing each other every week, sometimes I’d stay over, we’d go out for food, just small nice things.

This is the first person I have really liked since my ex which ended 2 years ago, and now im just so open about how I feel towards her, and she’s really not open about how she feels about me. She does say she wants to see me etc, but she also has mental health problems, so she likes to spend time by herself. 

I met her grandparents a few days ago and it went well, they supposedly said they loved me, which made me happy, but my overthinking and anxiety, is questioning it and I don’t know why. And last night, my head was spiralling out of control, and when we were out, I accidentally saw a message on her phone about a friend talking about someone looking fit, and my head went straight to maybe she’s speaking to someone else and her friend is validating it, and I messaged her about it and it made it a little messy bc I didn’t respect her privacy. 

So, I messaged her this morning apologising because it was completely wrong to do so, but my main thing was just reassurance and I genuinely don’t know how she feels about me, I just don’t know what to do because I’m really open about how I feel, and I was just asking question after question and I don’t want to come across like i want to be validated but I do just without asking. I don’t know what to do do I just ask what she genuinely feels about me asking for every detail, or just ask something else, WHAT DO I DO, I had a little bit of a cry and a panic attack thinking I was pushing her away from me.

Lots of heaches occurs but nothing painkillers can't deal with.

Had this for more than a year and stopped after I started sertraline, but now it's back. Last year I always thought I was dying of heart attack, this sommer it was cancer, last week copd. Haven't got another panic attack since a long time fortunately but I can't bear those ""what If..."" and honestly how would anyone at the hospital take me seriously to do any tests and finally clear my mind.

My whole body tend to aches (worse in the morning) but rib pain is anywhere anytime, comes and goes. The fatigue is almost shopping cause I can sleep from 19pm to 9am.

&lt;p&gt;Had this for more than a year and stopped after I started sertraline, but now it&amp;#39;s back. Last year I always thought I was dying of heart attack, this sommer it was cancer, last week copd.

,Anxiety,"Hey guys.

So I've been diagnosed with anxiety a long time ago and it's mostly manageable with some worse phases where it's really tough. At the moment it's tougher and my depression is showing a bit too.

So I met someone but unfortunately they live too far away for regular dates. When we met I felt really good and safe with that person and we talked about a lot of personal things, what we want in relationships etc. and we noticed that we really like each other and would love to get to know each other better and see where this goes. Whenever we text they're messages are super sweet and reassuring. However we don't text as much as I'd expect - I know they're really busy with major changes and it's probably due to that but it's still giving me major anxiety when I don't hear from them for some time (a day or more). Additionally we didn't really agree on anything more than to stay in contact, meet again and see how it goes. I'm planning to visit and they actually suggested staying longer than I initially planned so we'd have more time together, things like that that really show that they like me. Logically I feel rather safe about this.

But since my anxiety is spiking it's telling me they surely met someone else already or something and are actually not that interested after all. Things like that. Lots of things like that! Additionally I lost someone close to me not long ago and my fear of abandonment is at an all time high. I even thought about just ending this and not pursuing this further due to my anxious thoughts. Which is stupid because I logically feel good about this. It has the potential to be great! I am thinking about telling them that the lack of contact makes me insecure at times and that I have a hard time with dealing with not knowing for sure or mixed signals but I also don't want to come across as clingy or needy.

They know that I sometimes struggle with mental health, we talked about this. I know that I need to address the underlying issues and I'm in therapy and medicated.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Do you have suggestions on how I can deal with this anxiety or fear that absolutely contradicts what he tells and shows me when he does? Does it seem clingy if I text them my worries? I wish I could just trust what they tell and show me but especially in the beginning of something romantic and with not knowing for sure this is pure torture for my mind... Any help, experiences or insight are appreciated.

,Anxiety,"Realistically I know they can’t fire me because we have a point system with us having to reach 10 and a half points to be fired. I only had three points, now three and half, due to me suffering from severe and chronic migraines that make it difficult to work. I still show up daily and just suffer through them unless they’re so bad that I’m vomiting and too weak to get out of bed. 

Anyway, my “manager” who isn’t really my manager but instead a fill in until my new supervisor starts next week, was extremely mad at me, and trying to force me to tell him my reason for going home. I didn’t want to tell him that I’m dealing with severe depression and stress, so instead I told him I’ve been dealing with a week long migraine, which he told me that we both knew wasn’t true, even though it was and I had just been suffering through it and starving myself so I wouldn’t puke at work. 

Well now I’m stressed that he will tell actual management that I just abandoned my job even though I told him an hour into my shift that I was going to be leaving halfway through. He’s extremely angry at me even though this is my first time ever leaving early in the three years I’ve been there and I still made sure to make it to the halfway point just so no one would have to clean up my mess. I felt immediate relief when I told him I was going home, only for it to be ruined because now I’m completely stressed out again. 

This job is killing me and making my anxiety and migraines so much worse because I’m so stressed out. And I know I’m gonna have to deal with him being mad at me for the next month because anytime I call out he starts treating me bad and doing anything he can to make my job worse. 

Please give any advice you have. Unfortunately quitting isn’t an option. I can’t afford to not have a job and no one has replied to any of my job applications.

i showed this app to my psychiatrist and my therapist and both of them told me they were going to start recommending it to other patients because they liked it so much! 

also, there is a paid version that has a lot more features. i recommend just trying it out for free to see if it could be beneficial to you, but if you do like it and can afford the full version i highly recommend that, but it’s obviously not necessary. 

i hope someone finds this helpful! it has been really great for me and i think more people should be aware of this app because it’s the best mental health app i’ve ever had! and i hope you’re all doing alright ❤️

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone. I have high anxiety and mild depression. I argued against taking medication for like two years because of my age (22) and my fear of pills and anything doctor related. But my therapist finally said enough and that i would really benefit from taking it.

My psychiatrist gave me Elicea 5mg to start with, and she also gave me the ones that melt in mouth , as I am terrified of swallowing pills.

I have a big fear of pills or anything related to doctors and medicine in general . To be clear I am NOT against help, I just feel very panicked around those things. I literally can not take a painkiller. I never took any medicine in my life except antibiotics few times in childhood.

I am very scared of side effects and that something bad will happen to me. How are you guys dealing with fears of medicine? Dude anyone have any bad problems on antidepressants? Please any advice if you have for me.

I have high anxiety and mild depression. I argued against taking medication for like two years because of my age (22) and my fear of pills and anything doctor related. But my therapist finally said enough and that i would really benefit from taking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My psychiatrist gave me Elicea 5mg to start with, and she also gave me the ones that melt in mouth , as I am terrified of swallowing pills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a big fear of pills or anything related to doctors and medicine in general . To be clear I am NOT against help, I just feel very panicked around those things. I literally can not take a painkiller. I never took any medicine in my life except antibiotics few times in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very scared of side effects and that something bad will happen to me. How are you guys dealing with fears of medicine? Dude anyone have any bad problems on antidepressants? Please any advice if you have for me. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I’ve been having tension headaches for 2 months now and cannot stop myself from believing it’s a brain tumour or unruptured brain aneurysm the cause. My anxiety levels are killing at the thought that it is the case.

The headaches are tension but not painful only know and again the ache will appear briefly that starts from just above the neck and radiates round to above the ear and to the temples. The tension creates a lot of head pressure and the veins above the neck pulsate. I also have unilateral tinnitus which I first noticed 4 years ago and I can’t work out whether it’s pulsating or not because it’s a buzzing noise but then I sometimes hear my heartbeat in between and it’s driving me insane! Does anyone else suffer from these symptoms which could have a more simpler explanation?

I know the anxiety I feel is towards the rarest scenarios but I honestly cannot help myself. I do understand there are other logical causes such as my TMJ cracking and clicking on opening of the jaw on the side of my tinnitus, and tension referred from my poor posture in back neck and shoulders due to years of gaming. 

I can’t have a MRI for another 10 days as I’m working away in a different country and the wait is unbearable because I keep thinking I have an aneurysm waiting to rupture, silly thoughts I know?

This morning I woke up in a pissy mood and immediately wanted to take the medication because it does make me feel so much happier but I don’t want to experience any withdrawal if I ever forget to take it or want to come off of it. I am so upset that my doctor didn’t warn me about this. I’m reading everywhere that it’s a terrible medication. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone!

I’m currently going back home in nearly 3 days. It’s an international flight of 8 hours.

A year ago, I started getting sick the day of the flight and didn’t have any problems until they descended into the airport. I had a clogged ear for 1 hour afterwards and that was it. Now, every time I fly, I get anxious that I’ll be sick day before or right before the flight. 

I already have a flex ticket but would still have to pay for the change of price. It wouldn’t be so awful if it did happen, because I can change my flight to a few days later, but I still get anxiety. 😔

I’m not too sure how to combat this. I currently don’t feel ill now and limiting how much I go out, also with frequent sanitizing and hand washing. I take magnesium, calcium, and zinc along with vitamin c and iron supplements. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you!

,Anxiety,"Short version: can you have full on anxiety or panic attacks WITHOUT any sort of external cause, or negative/stressful internal thoughts?


LONG version, strap in if you're willing to read awhile 😂
 I've had many health issues for many years. They've gotten better, gotten worse, gotten better, worse. I'd say my baseline is better than it's been in years, but I've still a lot to work on. Primarily nutrient malabsorption and SIBO, bacterial gut infection. I'm also going to try quitting testosterone injections I was put in due to a misdiagnosis by a crappy money hungry private ""mens clinic"" 3 years ago, that just gave me acne, destroyed my skin, and has started to do damage to my hair. So that's all fun. Last  few weeks it's been vertigo, and a bloating feeling right on/in my diaphragm. That's probably the worst I'm facing right now. That, and feelings of air hunger, which I attribute to my entire body being tight, primarily my diaphragm. (Ive gotten many tests done, I know this isn't immediately life threating.) 


I think of my health issues often and gauge how my body is doing almost constantly, unless I am busy. Which usually means I'm reading, playing videogames, or when God blesses me with the energy, exercising. I like to cook too. But otherwise my mind always comes back to my health.

I had a therapist that equated my body with a Ferrari, or Lamborghini (I love cars.) 
If everything is dialed in and kept up with, I feel better. Hell, few weeks ago I broke my best mile time, 6:45. Ran 5k in about 25 minutes, if memory serves me right. Then I lifted weights for half an hour or maybe an hour, which I usually superset, so it's as if I got hours of lifting. (""Supersetting"" is where you do one exercise and move immediately to another, then another, then maybe another, and by the time you're done with 1 set of each your first muscle group is ready to go for the first exercise you did again, and so on.)

This morning my absolute best was walking about 2 miles on the treadmill, over half an hour with some incline. While doing so, I thought of my discomfort, of my bloating, occasional trouble breathing, constantly monitoring my heart rate and o2. I treat myself as a really brittle machine sometimes. Ended up needing to take clonazapam, as when I got done, I noticed I started to feel really worked up. Even though I'm not worried I'm dying or anything, just, very very uncomfortable. I think it helped a bit. I've had full on panic attacks before, this was not one, but I'd rather those feelings not get that bad. 

Anyways, when my mind is SET on my health and I'm being anal about it, I can't get my mind off health. Oh, I feel this today. It's this bad. Oh, starting to go away, cool, that means I don't have to take X supplement or X medication. Getting worse? Maybe I'll take that. That will help me because it's mechanism of action is Y, but because I will take that, I probably shouldn't take Z, because X will interact with Y, which may exaggerate the effects of Z, or may counteract Z's effects. 

I... wouldn't describe it as anxious thinking. To me it's just analytical. But I do wish it would just stop sometimes, it can get tiring. I mentioned thinking I have ADHD to my psychiatrist, he says we may try treating that once im off my testosterone. Which I didn't need on the first place, my T level was great prior to being duped by that clinic. Back before I even had a clue what an o2 sensor was, or what a good blood pressure is. I was gullible. Hopefully did no permanent damage with T injections asides from some acne scarring. Only time will tell there.


I'm just mind dumping here. Probably looks like the thoughts of a mad man or someone who is obviously anxious. I think I'd read it that way myself.

Right now I'm thinking I have ADHD that may spark panic, anxiety. Not entirely sure. A large aspect of it for me is my health. If I feel fine, or at least somewhat decent, anxious feelings and that constant THIS IS GOING ON SO I NEED TO DO THIS AND IF I DO THAT ILL HAVE RELIEF AND IF THAT DOESNT WORK I CAN DO THIS INSTEAD THATS ALWAYS WORKED BEFORE etc etc etc, just isn't there. And naturally I feel a bit calmer. There's less ""work"" to do, so to speak. 


Wild thing is I'm actually really laid back outside of these issues. I don't get worried or overthink anything else really. I dont  get anxious when most people would, or should.
I won't go too far into detail but I saved someone, some random guy, from a seizure he was having while I was working one day. Full on seizing up, convulsing, frothing. Me having sOmE medical knowledge at least yelled for someone to call 911 and I just got on the floor to hold his head, turned him over, all that stuff.

During and after, I was a little on edge. But not bad at all. More uh, exhilarated than anything. I really think working in medicine is my calling but that's another story. Point is, literally a life or death situation (granted, for someone else,) and I was just like K, I'll try to fix this, I know what to do here. Very happy I did. EMS came and got him and he started being able to speak before leaving in the ambulance, so I'm sure he's fine. May have forgotten his meds that day, for all I know.

Although my supervisor is trying to be really kind to me, I know she didn&amp;#39;t want these files to be spread to everybody either. She tells me not to worry but I can&amp;#39;t shake the feeling that she says that only out of courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upcoming Monday, the meeting with the senior employees will take place, where we discuss these files, and I&amp;#39;m sure somebody will say something about it or make a grumpy comment about it or make fun of me about it and I&amp;#39;m already dreading going to work this Monday so much. I&amp;#39;m so ashamed. I&amp;#39;ve already played this moment over and over in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that I&amp;#39;m in an anxiety loop and that things are probably not as bad as they seem but I feel so horrible about it, I can&amp;#39;t shake the fear for next Monday. I just want next week to be over already. How am I going to get through this weekend without killing myself with guilt and anxiety over Monday... 😖&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Just some context : I recently left my narcissistic household ( 3rd kid out of 4 to do so ) and moved in with my brother. Life is infinitely better here, and there’s so much I don’t have to worry about, but for some reason the past 4-5 days I’ve been having horrible anxiety / extreme overthinking episodes. 

Heres one of my journal entries : I feel so vulnerable and emotional today. out of the past 4-5 days, this one so far has been the worst. I’ve had to avoid crying multiple times. It’s just so weird to feel like this in a WAY better environment / situation, I seriously don’t know why this is happening. In the morning I felt detached and scared, it felt like I would get a gut punch when I thought about / looked at things that shouldn’t evoke that emotion. The only things I can think that might be causing this are : 1. Digital detox ( note : more time to think / overthink ) and 2. *my brother and his finances* 2 day trip over this weekend. The latter just doesn’t make sense though, usually I’m fine being alone, hell…sometimes I prefer being alone, but this time I feel scared. 

As of the time I’m writing this, I feel much better. I’m still scared to get back into an overthinking cycle but I feel good. My main question is : why do I feel like this even though I’m in a better spot? It’s especially scary, because I started overthinking my interactions with my brothers fiance, to the point where I was convinced she didn’t like me, and I was acting short and weird because I couldn’t stop over analyzing every little thing in our interactions.

Since then l've been in 2 accidents and I now absolutely dread getting behind the wheel.
The first incident was when I was about 2 months into driving and my instructor was pushing for me to start my independent driving. I was on a drive with my mum and as I was turning into my road another vehicle came off of a roundabout and due to my inexperience and her age neither of us had the reaction time to stop ending in her front bumper and the front side of my car getting damaged. Insurance chalked it up to 50/50 and being I was a new learner driver it absolutely shot my insurance and no claims. I was absolutely terrified to drive after this and it overall destroyed my confidence and I was just overall embarrassed about the whole thing. I did work really hard to make it through my fears and anxiety to get to a really good place and took my test only 8 months later passing with flying colours!

The whole ordeal really shocked me and although it wasn't my fault it's left me feeling like such a shit driver like who gets into 2 accidents in less than a year?!? Since this I'm so scared every time I get behind the wheel to the point where the only time I drive is the 10 minute drive to work and occasionally into town if someone else is in the passenger seat. It's like I'm waiting for another accident to happen and every move I make I just picture myself loosing control of the car and crashing. It doesn't help that l've moved to uni without my car so l've not driven for the past couple months. The thought of getting back into my car really scares me tbh and I just don't want to again which sucks because I remember the feeling of loving to drive and being so excited.

,Anxiety,"So, let me set the scene. I (28 F) had been desperately looking forward to this concert for weeks. This artist’s music holds a special place in my heart, because he is someone who I bonded over with my ex. An abusive ex, and it’s twisted, but it is what it is. Also none of my friends listen to this artist so I started searching online for someone to go with. I bought a VIP ticket with money I didn’t have, dressed up, and even got devil horns for the Halloween vibe. I was ready to make it a night to remember.

Enter M (26 M) the guy I thought would be my concert buddy. We met on Bumble. My interaction with this guy started off weird because he kept bringing up money. He told me we’d go clubbing after the concert but told me to bring my cards because his didn’t work and that he’d transfer me money online or whatever. It pissed me off and I lashed out at him. Anyway, I spoke out of desperation to him again in the morning because I hadn’t managed to find anyone else to go with. So he books a hotel near the venue, says we’ll pre booze and go. Of course I know he wants sex and I was down for it. 

So we drink, have sex, then suddenly he starts getting calls and texts saying his dad has had a heart attack. I tell him he should attend to his dad. He tells me the hotel is paid for so I should be okay. And left me by myself. Said he’ll update me on how his dad is. 

And then he disappeared. Not a text not a call. Left me alone in a sketchy hotel. Fine. I thought, “No big deal, I’ll take a quick nap and wake up in time for the concert.” But guess what? I slept through the entire performance. Woke up to find out I missed the one thing I was dying to experience. It felt like the universe was taking a giant dump on my plans.

And let’s talk about M. This guy made a big show about not wanting to make me feel pressured about paying for things, yet he left me high and dry without even checking on me afterward. Not a single message to see if I was okay or if I felt safe alone in this hotel. I wasn’t expecting some deep connection but yes I was expecting basic decency. 

Now I’m left with a mix of emotions—anger, sadness, and disappointment. I wanted to share this experience with someone who understood how much this concert meant to me, and instead, I’m stuck here feeling like a fool. I’m at the hotel, not even sure if it’s really paid for, all alone, with alcohol, having missed the one thing I was dying to see and everyone knew how desperate I was for this concert. I broke down. It’s been hours since and I can’t wrap my head around what just happened to me. 

I just needed to vent about how utterly ridiculous and heartbreaking this whole situation is. Has this happened to anybody? Or is this just my personal tragedy?

,Anxiety,"For 8 months I've been dealing with constant Brain fog due to my anxiety which I'm currently getting therapy for and it's the Main symptom that causes me the most grief.

The best way I can describe it is that it feels like I can't concentrate no matter how hard I try, my vision feels blurry (Even after being told my eyes are fine when I had an eye test), my head feels heavy sometimes and I overall just feel disconnected mentally from my surroundings. This is impacting my time I spend with friends and family or even Gaming which is my main pass time making it really hard to enjoy those things. It seems to vary in intensity from day to day. If it does appear during the day it usually doesn't go away until I sleep and wake up the next morning then the cycle repeats.

I'm currently not on medication and haven't had any for my anxiety as of yet. I'm trying to go on more walks and I do breathing exercises as often as I can.

So my questions are:  
Do other people here experience Brain fog from their anxiety and is it the similar to how I described?  
Would anxiety medication help me in this case?  
Is their anything I can try to help reduce it?

I'm very much at the point of being fed up because my brain feels like it's just not working how it should :(

,Anxiety,"My entire family has been sick the past two weeks with some mysterious bug. All of our tests have come back negative. Blood tests show a ""slight infection"" and we were all told to take OTC cold medicines. It's not at all scary or life threatening, but it does make me exhausted, fevery, and nauseous all day long. I also have a lot of health anxiety, which is usually only quelled by having a positive diagnosis and medicine to treat whatever I'm going through, so to be told they don't know what we have and that there's nothing they can prescribe us has been a little difficult for my brain. I usually end up having a panic attack every two days because I will suddenly just feel very sick and then my brain will worry too much and send me into a spiral. It's been very frustrating because I don't like mixing medications (*at all*) and so if I take my Klonopin for anxiety, I then can't allow myself to take my Nyquil or Dayquil for the sickness. It basically feels like I have to choose between having a panic attack or feeling sick and that's been very frustrating.

We're now on day thirteen or so of the whole house being sick. I have extreme anxiety centered around our family dog- mostly because he has anxiety and the two of us sometimes feed off of each other. When he gets anxious, I get anxious, and then the two of us get into a never-ending back and forth. He usually only gets anxiety when there's been a major change to his routine and that's already happened due to us all being sick. We're all spending more time in bed, less time outside, we can't play with him as often or take him for walks most days. I've been noticing the last few days that he's started getting lethargic and less playful, he spends most days sleeping or pouting at us. And because of that, I've already been sort of prematurely worrying and anticipating that he's going to have an anxious episode soon.

Today, he's been the worst. He's just curled up in his bed all day and refusing to eat or acknowledge any of us. When I first saw him today I almost immediately started panicking. My parents both told me to go stay in my room today and not to worry, that they'd be watching him closely and giving him his meds.

Now I've been in my room for six hours. I've taken my panic pill but that means I have to feel sickly for the rest of the day, which will in turn make me more anxious, which will in turn make me feel more sick. And I just feel very frustrated and alone and upset because I feel like I'm trapped in a cycle in my brain where I'm either worried about a panic attack or I'm worried about being super sick and both of them feed off each other.

I just feel crazy today. I feel insane and I'm really putting myself down a lot about my mental health. I just wish I could respond to things normally, that I could react to things normally, I wish I didn't have this anxiety constantly plaguing my mind and making mundane things so much worse than they need to be.",t2_36g0xd4s,False,,0,False,Having a really hard time today,[],r/Anxiety,False,,venting,0,,,False,t3_1gc3qo1,False,light,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Venting,False,1,,False,False,self,1729887904.0,,[],{},,True,,1729887641.0,text,,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My entire family has been sick the past two weeks with some mysterious bug.

,Anxiety,"I'm a 20 year old college student and I have been anxious for this whole month. It all started a month ago when I had covid. Even though it was pretty mild, a week after I got over the initial infection I started experiencing insomnia which was triggered by a panic attack that I didn't know I had at the time, but thinking back on it it was definitely a panic attack. After that night I woke up with a feeling of my thoughts having ""slowed down"" which made me go down a googling frenzy and conclude I have brain fog and long covid ( I didn't have any other symptoms of long covid and I wasn't cognitively impaired, I could still think normally, solve problems and understand everything being said to me, but I had a feeling my brain was thinking ""more slowly"" and it made me a bit forgetful when I would actively try to remember something even though id remember it a couple minutes later) and it sent me down a health anxiety frenzy which made me experience a horrible panic attack a week later which sent me to the ER. I have been getting better for quite a bit, I can sleep normally and don't wake up during the night, most of my health anxiety symptoms are gone and I don't frantically google symptoms anymore, but regular anxiety still persists till this day. At the beginning I was feeling anxious the whole day, but now it has subdued and I only feel anxious at night and sometimes during the day, but my worst ""symptom"" is crying. At night for some reason I cry because of this constant feeling of doom that I will never recover from this feeling and that I will always feel like this and there's no help for me. During the day I am completely high functioning, I can go to uni without a problem, I recently found a student job and I have no problem completing tasks there, but at night I feel like everything suddenly comes down and I just feel awful. I would like to know if anyone has experienced anything similar and if it kind of gradually goes away on it's own or if it's something I should definitely see a therapist about. My mom's take on this is that I'm stuck in a depressive episode because of some reason (most likely uni) because I've switched majors this year because I didn't do well last year which created a  fear or not doing good this year either but I'm not sure that's the reason because when I think about it it doesn't make me actively scared, but again it could be subconscious.

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some reassurance and perspective on a situation that’s been weighing on me.

There’s a local café I’ve been visiting frequently for about a year, and I’ve developed a strong connection with the owner. Her café feels like a safe space, and she’s been incredibly kind and supportive. I’ve even shared with her that I’m autistic, which she’s been very understanding about.

Recently, I’ve been struggling with overthinking about whether I’m overstepping any boundaries or annoying her by visiting too often. I sent her a message expressing my gratitude and how much her café means to me, and she responded warmly, saying I “always have a place here in all our hearts.” This was very reassuring, but I still find myself overthinking and worrying that I might be a burden.

I’m planning to give her a bit of space for a few days before visiting again, just to help ease my anxiety and make sure I’m being respectful of her boundaries. I care deeply about this connection and want to handle it thoughtfully, but I could really use some reassurance that I’m not overstepping.

,Anxiety,"Hey AnxieTeam,
I’m needing some help. I just got off Buspar and got prescribed 10mg propranolol for anxiety. I do not have hypertension and actually tend to have a lower systolic rate. I also take 20mg Ritalin for my adhd. 

My question is, how long does the propranolol stay in and work with my anxiety?  I asked my provider and they were just vague saying to take it when I know I’m going to be in a stressful situation. But I dunno when those happen. I use to just take buspar every morning with my other meds but had to get off of it because it caused tremendous brain fog. I asked the pharmacist and he said it lasts 6-12 hours….thats a huge gap! That’s like half a day’s difference! Google is even worse. 

So those of you who take this for anxiety, do you take it everyday, if so do you take it in the morning or afternoon? How long does it help? 

I’m aware with propranolol, it focuses more on the physical symptoms that come with anxiety as opposed to the anxiety itself.

I can&amp;#39;t stand it. It makes me terribly anxious and I just feel awful. 
I&amp;#39;m a biology student and have my bachelor&amp;#39;s thesis now, meaning a 3 months of laboratory work and one month if writing. My lab work was supposed to end next week but we spontaneously decided to end it TODAY. It genuinely made me so upset when I went home I almost cried and then I lied down in bed for several hours because I felt so utterly terrible. It&amp;#39;s just a week less laboratory work, what&amp;#39;s the deal? Well it wasn&amp;#39;t what we planned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has advice please help because I can&amp;#39;t keep feeling like this every time plans slightly change.
Thank you in advance &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"One of my highest anxiety triggers is taking my cat to the vet. It is one of her highest anxiety triggers too.

I scheduled her check-up for next week. We've been together for almost 7 years and for the first time she will actually go to the clinic by herself. In the vet's own car, they have that ""home-clinic-home"" service. Originally I had this idea because I'm struggling with agoraphobia lately and I don't trust myself making it there this time. If it was just me I would try but I don't want to risk her well being, if I can't make it she will need another car ride and get stressed 2 different days. 

THEN, it also seemed like a good idea because how generally anxious both me and my cat are. I'm a single cat parent and one of my nightmares is having her sick when I'm also sick and can't take her in. Now that are we both okay, this will be good to test it and see how it goes. Also since I'm also anxious, I want to see if we make things worse for each other. I know her anxiety increases mine, maybe my anxiety increases hers and she will do better without me? It will be good to test it too.

And yet... I feel like I'm betraying my cat almost and forcing her into a test ride she didn't sign up for. Which is ridiculous, during the pandemic I was with her only until the clinic but they did not allow me to the exam room. The ride takes only 10 minutes anyway, checkup for an hour or less. But in my head everything goes wrong. They have a car accident, they somehow break the carrier and she escapes. tests take longer than planned and she spends more time at the clinic by herself, sees a big dog...

,Anxiety,"I’m a collage student and today we had to present a presentation about mental health in a group of four. We never planned it - we weren’t supposed to, we weren’t being lazy - and we had been told about it the day before. We basically had to read out a PowerPoint and improvise it. 

I was tasked with presenting the introduction. We were the second group to do so. For context I am a bubbly and confident person, although very sensitive. I love speaking to people. But I have severe OCD and anxiety which only my close friends know about. I got to the introduction and I was in front of about 20 people. I immediately became anxious, fumbled over my words before completely freezing up and stopping for what must have been at least twenty seconds. I could feel the microphone shaking because of my unsteady hand and I couldn’t see the paper I was reading from because tears filled my eyes. The teacher had to interfere (he’s a lovely person and we get along well, it wasn’t done with malice but instead kindness) and told me to just continue off of the PowerPoint. It completely threw me off, and I was a nervous wreck from then on. I couldn’t focus on anything we were doing because I was too busy trying not to break down. 

The presentation was fine but very difficult for me to get through. The teacher evaluated our group and didn’t mention my complete freeze, which I am glad at, for I would have started crying. He said something about how I was the “smiliest person” he knew but I couldn’t even hear what he was saying because I felt disoriented. I had to pinch my leg incredibly hard to stop myself from crying. We sat down and took a break but I immediately started sobbing afterwards, where I was then comforted by my friend who reassured me, which I am glad for, but otherwise didn’t say much. I cried throughout the break and was tearful the next two hours throughout everybody else’s performance. I was filled with a sense of foreboding because I saw how better their introductions were instead of mine and I felt incredibly humiliated and ashamed in myself. OCD contributes to my guilt very often, I don’t know if it contributed here, but it likely could have played a part. I haven’t stopped ruminating over this and I just feel like I’m going to cry whenever I think back to it because it wasn’t a representation of who I am. I am a confident person and I am very ashamed of myself for my poor performance. We will have to learn this speech and perform it 5 separate times.

,Anxiety,"I know everyone experiences different or the same symptoms as anxiety is mixed with brain fog but i want to know how other people feel. I, personally have a lot of pressure on the right side of my head, especially my ears. Sometimes i feel off balance, i can't think right, slow process of information and also i don't feel real. 

It's very hard to deal with, especially with anxiety making it worse and also can be scary . I'm getting tested to check if i have celiac disease and at this point i'm honestly believing that's what the cause is of my anxiety &amp; brain fog.

I've always dealt with anxiety and it was easy to control, but ever since i had a sudden panic attack in august .. I've never felt the same as i used to. I can't concentrate right , i feel like my right arm and leg isn't attached to my body but it still functions normally. I honestly don't know it's very weird. At the end of the day i just want to know what is causing my anxiety to get worsen everyday. I'm also a really big hypochondriac but at this point im starting to calm down and make myself understand that i'm not having anything wrong with my brain. Sometimes it's hard to calm down because, again any little sensation snaps me back into that spiral sadly.

I, personally have a lot of pressure on the right side of my head, especially my ears. Sometimes i feel off balance, i can&amp;#39;t think right, slow process of information and also i don&amp;#39;t feel real. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very hard to deal with, especially with anxiety making it worse and also can be scary . I&amp;#39;m getting tested to check if i have celiac disease and at this point i&amp;#39;m honestly believing that&amp;#39;s what the cause is of my anxiety &amp;amp; brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always dealt with anxiety and it was easy to control, but ever since i had a sudden panic attack in august .. I&amp;#39;ve never felt the same as i used to. I can&amp;#39;t concentrate right , i feel like my right arm and leg isn&amp;#39;t attached to my body but it still functions normally. I honestly don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s very weird. At the end of the day i just want to know what is causing my anxiety to get worsen everyday. I&amp;#39;m also a really big hypochondriac but at this point im starting to calm down and make myself understand that i&amp;#39;m not having anything wrong with my brain. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s hard to calm down because, again any little sensation snaps me back into that spiral sadly. &lt;/p&gt;

911 telling me to chew aspirin made it worse. my boyfriend was right next to me and he was so good but i couldn’t look at him because i worried it would be the last time id ever see him. i was certain i was dying. 

ems came, and i went to the er, sat for five hours while they did chest x-rays and blood work and every other test possible. absolutely nothing. 

they ruled it as stress and told me to take a day off of work. 

i’ve just… never had a panic attack where i wasn’t panicking. it was all physical and i think that scares me more than the mental part. at least if im panicking i have a reason or something to blame for why im feeling a certain way. with this it was every worst health related anxiety fear come true. i don’t think ive ever been that scared for my life before. 

i feel even worse putting my family and my boyfriend through all of that worry and stress just for it to be as insignificant as “stress”. the hospital bills aren’t helping that worry either.

,Anxiety,"Hey all, I’ve been working on an idea that I thought might resonate with others interested in tech + mental health management. After talking with my therapist about it, I’m developing a CustomGPT model to act as a feedback loop for my anxiety, using techniques from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). It’s definitely not intended to replace therapy but rather as a personal tool to support it.

# What it Does:

* **Feedback-Only Approach:** The idea is to have a safe space where I can talk through and weigh out my thoughts and worries without expecting “solutions” or conclusions from the tool. Think of it as a sounding board where I can process my thoughts in real-time.
* **CBT-Inspired Prompts and Guidance:** The model will ask questions based on CBT principles, helping me identify unhelpful thinking patterns, challenge negative thoughts, and assess my assumptions. It’s like having CBT worksheets but in conversational form.
* **Mindfulness and Grounding Exercises:** When I need them, I can ask the tool for short, guided mindfulness exercises or grounding techniques. These are things I’d typically use during a session, and they’re easy to pull up anytime.

# Why I’m Creating It:

My therapist liked the idea, especially since it’s focused on creating awareness and self-reflection, not giving advice. Sometimes I need to talk through things in the moment, between sessions, and having a structured space with CBT prompts feels better than journaling alone. Plus, my therapist has encouraged me to separate thoughts and feelings from “good” or “bad” labels, and this tool could reinforce that idea.

**Here are my Prompts and Knowledge I am feeding it:**

,Anxiety,"Whenever I talk to people, it feels like my brain is working overtime. While actively I'm talking to that person, passively I'm analysing and reviewing everything i say just to make sure i didn't say anything embarrassing. Just today i had to go out with an acquaintance to get some work done. He's a jolly person cracking jokes with everyone. I was talking to him normally adding a few sarcastic lines here and there. I thought everything went fine but the moment i got home i literally had tears in my eyes. I kept reviewing every part of the conversation and how i might have sounded stupid and immature. I starting having really bad palpitations thinking what he must be thinking about me and how my jokes might have been offensive or shitty.

When u accept u're not gonna die , or have a Panic attack or anything ... , u gonna feel inner peace instead. 

2_ ignore , when u accept start ignoring the OCD that brings fears , the OCD is like a little naughty Kid , don't have a discussion with him 
For exp , if a little kid aged 3-5 Y.o says to you , ( i'm gonna K*ll you ! ) , Are you gonna be afraid of him ? Or u gonna say ( haha do it), and just ignore him  ? .

3_Do , Do something else, play quick game , do some push-ups , Talk to ur friends or family , go out for a 15 min walk while listening to music or Podcast... , if u r religious go pray and ask God for peace ,etc ... 
in the first 30 seconds to 2 min 
You gonna forget that u had OCD and fear

,Anxiety,"Hello everyone, I‘m 17 and I‘m currently so so scared I might have lymphoma. 
I used to have the same fear a year ago and it turned out to be nothing. However, right now I‘m abroad (4 more weeks) and this weirdly made my anxiety go up again. There‘s one lymph node on the right side of my neck and one on the left side that i can feel when I touch my neck there. That’s one thing that already scared me. Next thing is, in the past 5 weeks, I often had a feeling of shortness of breath. Like not being able to breathe in completely and feeling like I can’t get enough air into my lungs. I had this once when I was like 13 but now it’s there again and I don’t know why.
Today when I was yawning, my neck started to hurt a little where my lymph nodes are and that was the final thing that made me spiral today. I seriously can’t concentrate on anything else because I am so convinced I have lymphoma. The fear is especially bad because last year, a friend of a friend had lymphoma which kind of proved to me that I can also get it at 17 years old.

,Anxiety,"Having anxiety is so hard when your in high school and it makes it so hard to actually focus. My mind is always just thinking about what’s going to happen next and what might happen and it makes me so worried. I’m always scared to talk in front of my class and will only speak if I’m spoken to, I don’t even use the bathroom and will literally hold my pee until I’m about to piss on myself before I will ask to go to the restroom. Even in the restroom I will wait until everyone leaves out before I use it. I feel like people think I’m weird because at lunch I usually stay in the bathroom stall on my phone because I don’t want to be surrounded by and looked at by so many people at lunch. Group assignments are even worse because I’m never able to contribute anything to the group and usually just sit there in silence. I’m not even able to utter one word to the one friend I have when we’re in front of people and usually wait until we’re alone to finally say anything to her.

,Anxiety,"**TL;DR**: My daily multiple panic attacks were caused by symptoms I thought were due to either seizures, death, or cardiac arrest when, in reality, it was just indigestion and the silent migraines I wasn't aware of...

So, I'm finally managing my anxiety after 3 years of struggle. While I haven't had a full-blown panic attack in months now, I'm still a work in progress, as I'm still anxious over relatively futile things. But at least I've gotten my life back on track.

I decided to face my anxiety and negative thoughts. It was very difficult—emotionally challenging and harsh beyond words—but I discovered what was triggering my physical symptoms. For this reason, I cannot recommend enough that you keep a journal:

1) **GERD and Digestive Issues**: Before my daily panic attacks fully manifested, I noticed I was bloated all the time, but I usually shrugged it off—until I couldn’t. Sometimes, I was so bloated I could hardly breathe, and *every time* these monstrous panic attacks hit, I noted in my journal that I had awful bloating and acid reflux.

The very day I started to eat mindfully, my overall stress and anxiety levels dropped noticeably. It was incredible, but I also felt so dumb: how could digestion ever make me feel like I was going to die or faint? Turns out the vagal nerve is crazy powerful and can send you into panic model quite easily due to only digestive troubles. 

2) **Silent Migraine and Poor Posture**: 

I'm a workaholic, and when I start working, boy, do I work! I’d spend hours in front of my computer screen, typing more and more, but it took a serious toll on my poor eyes. Sometimes, they felt weird—dry, but not really; tired, yet closing them didn’t help either. After a while with these strange eye symptoms, my neck would get stiff and painful, eventually leading to a strange pressure in my skull and flashing lights. That would send me into a state of utter fear and terror! I’d feel like crying, experience severe derealization, and think I’d faint or die at any moment, but it turned out these were just silent migraines causing all that fear for nothing.

Today, I still have these symptoms every day, but they’re much better: I eat mindfully, so I have less bloating, and I avoid certain foods to prevent acid reflux. I blink more often to prevent eye strain/computer eye syndrome, maintain better posture while working or using my phone, and avoid putting too much pressure on my neck. Even if I still have these migraines sometimes, they don’t scare me anymore! The symptoms are still unpleasant and sometimes worry me, but I don’t have those awful adrenaline rushes anymore, and my life is much better!

she prescribed me 5mg of primolut n ( Norethisterone) and said that i’ll get a withdrawal bleeding when i stop it. 

My fear is that i dont get my period after i stop it even though i took 5 pregnancy tests the last one i took was 3 weeks after my last sex encounter which is [anal sex] btw , it was negative. 

My boyfriend is so relieved and thinks that I’m overreacting and dramatic, and if you check my posts you’ll see that everyone is sick of my “ irrational fear “ .

My period is 2 weeks late it has never been that late. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I visited my gynecologist she diagnosed me with pcos from an ultrasound that i did last year! She didnt ask for new blood tests she didnt check if i was pregnant or not, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she prescribed me 5mg of primolut n ( Norethisterone) and said that i’ll get a withdrawal bleeding when i stop it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fear is that i dont get my period after i stop it even though i took 5 pregnancy tests the last one i took was 3 weeks after my last sex encounter which is [anal sex] btw , it was negative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend is so relieved and thinks that I’m overreacting and dramatic, and if you check my posts you’ll see that everyone is sick of my “ irrational fear “ . &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Hey there. Just joined this reddit group. I've been dealing with OCD most of my life and along with it comes anxiety and panic attacks. Although my anxiety and panic attacks haven't been a thing until this last year and been getting worse over the last month. I'm 32. My OCD is the type of shit you see in TV that seems unreal, such and number favoritism, light switch flipping, certain steps patterns, turning my hand and head certain ways, and if some of this isn't done properly, I have to go back and redo it. I sound insane, I know. My OCD has been getting worse. Along with all this, I can be a heavy drinker and it causes me to have crippling anxiety/panic attacks. They get so bad, it's to the point where my head feels out of body, I have uncontrollable shaking, impending doom and my heart races a million miles an hour. Once I am able to finally calm and and go to bed, I feel absolutely exhausted for a couple days. My doctor told me to stop drinking, so I did for about 4 1/2 days. I went to the bar and I my had 4 beers and one shot. Later in the eve when I got home my anxiety started kicking in again. I think my drinking obviously is a factor. My doctor prescribed me to 5mg Lexapro which I've used in the past for depression back in 2019. It helped me a lot and haven't taken it since. He also prescribed me to 25mg Hydroxyzine. I know it sounds goofy but I haven't started taking these yet because I feel if I take them I'm going to start having a panic attack. I think some of this is due to being drugged at a bar almost 2 years ago and my anxiety/panic attacks feel almost like when I was drugged, so I don't know if it's a strange PTSD reaction or something. Can anyone give me some peace of mind letting me know if Lexapro or Hydroxyzine has helped them? Thanks, and if you got through this long excerpt, I again thank you!

,Anxiety,"I  started working at a small company (like less than 30 people) about a month ago, and it’s been great. They really value having time off, compensating well, and having a good, relaxed culture. Which makes it weird that I have a new form of anxiety: I don’t want to them think I’m taking advantage of their generosity.

Today I brought in some candy for a Halloween bowl in the lobby, and was later asked how much it cost so they can reimburse me. Personally, I didn’t care and didn’t have the receipt, but they really insist that I should not have to pay for things in the office, even if it’s as a kindness. I just ordered a monitor riser for my desk and they said I should bring in the receipt for that.  It was nice to hear, but a part of me almost feels akin to being lectured after doing something wrong. Now I’m almost afraid to bring in things to decorate my desk like a cute mousepad.

,Anxiety,"Hey everyone,

I have suffered from bad anxiety and panic attacks my whole life, but the worst ones are these ones I have at night.. 

For years on and off (usually if I’m really stressed in my life I will have it every night for weeks) I get the weirdest panic attacks an hour after I fall asleep. I will wake up either hyperventilating or literally sleep walking freaking out and feel extremely confused. While waking up I am pretty much delirious.. I will have no idea where I am, who I am, the one last night I couldn’t even remember if I owned a car had I felt like I needed to leave my apartment. Sometimes I wake up and can see my surroundings, but I can’t move or figure out where I am. 

I have had many people who have been near me when this happen tell me I will start hyperventilating or freaking out in my sleep before even opening my eyes and waking up. Like I said above sometimes I even sleep walk while this is happening. When I wake up it takes me about 10 mins to figure out where I am and what’s going on and calm down. Then every time I look at the clock it’s almost exactly an hour after I fall asleep.. and I get so scared to go back to sleep that it will happen again but it barely ever happens twice in one night. 

Anyone else experience this and have any recommendations on how to help with this? It’s horrible.

,Anxiety,"Hi I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder but hadn’t experienced this feeling of falling or sinking into the ground, almost like the ground isn’t hard it’s like airy?! if that makes sense. This feeling started towards the end of my almost 1 year INTENSIVE university course. It lasted for 2 weeks and it was terrifying. Also experienced 2-3 jolts of suddenly waking up while almost falling asleep for a few days. 

Turns out it was completely stress and exhaustion related. I was over exerting my body and brain wayyyy too much because I was trying to be an over- achiever. Which isn’t bad at all, it’s just that I also needed to incorporate balance and rest days and practice saying no, which I did not do. So my body was trying to tell me to slow down and do something that brings me joy. I didn’t have a choice to slow down until my course ended (but my body was kind of forcing me to). Since my course finished, I’ve been sleeping a lot, going for short walks with my dog, cooking, watching my favourite shows and movies, skincare, low intensity muscle workouts at home, hanging out with friends, shopping etc. Just stuff that brings me joy and calmness. I also started eating mainly immunity boosting foods like fish, veg, chicken, salad, berries, green juice. 

That feeling has significantly reduced but I slightly notice it’s symptoms (very slightly) when I stay out for more than 6 hours e.g. shopping or work etc. But it gets better each day. So I think this feeling is our body’s way of telling us to slow down and do something we love that brings us calmness simply because we deserve it and it is on our path.
Hope this helps someone!

,Anxiety,"This might sound somewhat dramatic but I’m just having a really bad time, and it set me off. I’m in college, and I’m in a history class that has a group chat with everyone in it. There’s a group of people who do study sessions in it. I was there when they first formed the group and even joined the separate group chat for it, because I had been planning on going to one of their study sessions. They got super close and kind of formed a friend group and so I got super nervous and never ended up going because I didn’t want to feel like I was intruding on them or something, idk how to explain my thought process.

Anyways they came out and said that anymore who wanted access to their document (it pretty much goes over all the basics of the test in detail) either had to pay them or attend the study session. Originally I was just going to study myself, or study with a friend because I’m not about to be paying lol. But I decided I wanted to be brave today and decided I would go to a study session, because I’ve been having difficulty reaching out and talking to people. I felt like if I didn’t eventually talk to someone I would just never do it, so what better time than the present?

Anyways I messaged the chat asking what the location was for the study group, because I hadn’t seen it in the chat. These people respond very aggressively, well maybe not aggressive but more passive aggressive. At least that’s how I read it. They said something along the lines of “it’s literally in the group chat- just scroll up” and I just felt so humiliated and stupid I apologized, left all the group chats, including the study group one, and then cried in the shower for 10 minutes. 

That may seem like an overreaction but im just having a really difficult time in college. I didn’t go to college with anyone I knew, because I never had friends in high school. I struggled with making friends in college, I mean I talked to a few people, but I never remained in contact because I got overwhelmed. I struggle with keeping friends or talking to people in general, and the one time I actually try I feel like I just got crushed. I feel like someone took my soul out of my body and crushed it in their hands. Idk I just know I’m on the verge of a crash and that sent me to the edge for a while, I’ve calmed down a bit.

Was I overreacting? I was thinking of going anyways but I don’t think I can, I don’t think my body will let me. Idk, any advice?

,Anxiety,"So, I've grappled with all kinds of anxiety all my life. Paranoid, social, etc... It stems from adverse childhood experiences. I have been in and out of doctor offices for it, so I'm hoping I don't get a ""ask your therapist"" comment because trust me that's all I've been doing lmao.

Despite heavily struggling with anxiety, I've gotten pretty good at managing it for the most part. There are two main challenges that no matter what I do, nothing is really helping me grow. I'm slowly getting better at them both as I learn to take more risks, but I'm hoping you all might have some advice? I'll number the situations.

1. Going outside. Once I'm outside, and heading to where I need to go, I'm fine. Even if I'm having a hard time on the way, once I'm physically there, I'm fine. But the idea of getting up, going to class or the grocery store or whatever it is, makes my heart race. I do have depression but this feels different, it's not that I'm unmotivated it literally just fills me with so much anxiety. Also, seeing people gives me a little anxiety, but not enough to make me not want to go to class. Also to be clear, I am not a homebody - I love going outside, and I don't fear that horrible things will happen to me if I step outside my door, I'm actually more comfortable outside than I am in my own home. What could be causing my fear of going outside?

2. It's second nature for me to question myself before I say something. By the time I decide to say it or not, the conversation has moved on. It results in my just smiling or staring awkwardly but not really adding anything. There's this guy I'm dating and even though I'm shy and opening up to him, this keeps happening and it makes me feel like he can't truly get to know me. I want him to like me. I want to be comfortable in speaking freely. And I also want to think before I speak. I know what the balance looks like, but I struggle to achieve it.

I was going to go from 40mg to 60mg on Prozac but now i am reading that can cause tremors... Ive been on Prozac for years, never had tremors till recently. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"1 month ago, I found a lump in my breast and had an ultrasound / biopsy. During the 4 days of waiting for results, I started experiencing severe anxiety. Even after receiving good results, 4 weeks later, I am still struggling.

Whilst waiting for my biopsy results, I developed a constant tension headache, pacing around, hardly able to focus on anything. Not good when I have 2 young children. I kept imagining having breast cancer and then started seeing a lot of posts on cancer (gofundmes, ads, fundraising on facebook and instagram) which seemed to ""confirm"" my diagnosis in my mind. Ive since uninstalled the apps.

Results came back fine!
But then progressively I started developing some concerning symptoms -  pins and needles and weak feeling in my left hand and foot (like when your leg is about to fall asleep), tension headache on and off, left eye started feeling like it was blurry although my vision was still fine, occasional ringing in left ear. I began assuming I have a brain tumor.😞

Now:
Headache is mostly leftside but now affects all over. The idea of a brain tumor consumes my thoughts.

The headache is almost constant, even when I'm distracted. Only time it seems to be gone is when I wake up but then it slowly starts to come back. Afternoons are worse.

I have never been like this or truly understood how awful anxiety is!

Doctor prescribed Pristiq (50mg) but I had to stop after a week due to dizziness which increased my anxiety about a brain tumor. She now wants me to start Zoloft but I'm hesitating. 

I've just organised an MRI for 8th November - thinking maybe it will remove the worry?

Has anyone else experienced anxiety trigger like this and had it stick around? 
Can anxiety create all these symptoms?
Do I need therapy? 

I just want to enjoy life again and not think the worse 24/7.😟

Sorry for the super long post. Thank you for reading.

,Anxiety,"Forgive this ramble of a post but this has just been on my mind today. I am a 39yo female in the USA. I have now come to realize that I must have had anxiety and OCD for much of my life. 
I feel like things I read and see online and other sources of media are doing a better job of identifying and addressing the topics of anxiety, depression, OCD, and everything in between. 
When I was growing up and when I was in high school, college, and beginning my career in my early 20s, I carried around huge emotional burdens and feelings of panic and worry and I didn’t know what they were or how to describe them or what to do about them. 
I came to think that these mental and emotional burdens were normal. Surely all adults just felt these same things. And my panic attacks, tingly/numbness, and racing heart and shortness of breath all came later. And I was dismissed by doctors. I went through with unnecessary health screenings I didn’t need (stress tests, heart CT scan, pulmonologist appointments and testing) because there wasn’t really anything wrong with me, other than my anxiety/stress, that no one identified or discussed with me as an issue. 
So. Anyway. I just hope that these days, the topic of mental health/anxiety/stress is better understood and identified and discussed for people. Because it really wasn’t for me and it took me a lot of years to really understand what was happening to me and how to handle it. And the thought of even one other person having to go through several years of how I felt, mentally and physically, makes me sad.

,Anxiety,"I live with my boyfriend and his family. They have 4 dogs, all small. One dog, Nub Nub, does not like me. When my boyfriend introduced me to all the dogs, Nub Nub was the only one to snap at me when I tried to pet him. He had no problem with my boyfriend holding him but when I tried to touch him, Nub Nub got pissed.

10 days ago, I was walking through one of the rooms to go the kitchen. I accidentally stepped on the tip of Nub Nub’s foot and he instantly bit the side of my left foot. He was tolerable of me before that. He got me *pretty* good, tore skin and caused me to bleed quite a bit. 

Now I’ve had a massive fear of contractions rabies for the past two years, but this has caused me to mentally spiral out of control. About 3-4 days after he bit me, I went to the emergency room because I was having major anxiety about it. My boyfriend’s family swears up and down that Nub Nub is vaccinated, which I’ve reluctantly took their word for. The doctor seemed pretty confident that I didn’t have rabies since the bite wasn’t hot and it was  healing well according to them, so I didn’t have much to worry about, but I’m still panicking. 

I can’t stop reading up on it, having anxiety attacks now more than ever thinking im going to parish at any moment. I scare myself into not drinking water, thinking it’ll hurt me because I know that’s what rabies does but I’m not experiencing any symptoms. People say it can stay in your system for months or a year and that’s what’s scaring me. I don’t want to die.

Nub Nub is calm unless I’m in the room, then he’ll bark at me. He doesn’t want to be around me AT ALL. I’ve never had this happen before. He’s fine around his familiar family but absolutely does not like me.

,Anxiety,"Hello all, I'm looking for advice about my health anxiety. I feel like this started out of nowhere, but I am in medical school so now everything we learn about has begun to freak me out. It started with pain in my left arm and a sensation I was going to pass out, and from there it's spiraled into constant worrying. This happened for 2 weeks, and I had to cancel my plans with my friends multiple times because I was convincing myself something was seriously wrong with me.

I made a DRs appointment and 2 days before, my anxiety was getting so bad that I went to urgent care because I thought I was going to pass out or have a stroke. They gave me the all clear and I was able to calm down. I was so on edge the muscles in my shoulders and neck going up the back of my head felt like they were burning. My DR started me on 10mg lexapro and 25mg hydroxyzine, which have helped me tremendously. The hydroxyzine made me feel almost immediately better. I only took one dose of hydroxyzine since my DR really wants me to only take it as needed, and all the tension in my neck and shoulders has considerably subsided in only one day.

Today, I haven't had terrible anxiety over my health because I'm really trying to overcome this issue.

I feel like this started out of nowhere, but I am in medical school so now everything we learn about has begun to freak me out. It started with pain in my left arm and a sensation I was going to pass out, and from there it&amp;#39;s spiraled into constant worrying. This happened for 2 weeks, and I had to cancel my plans with my friends multiple times because I was convincing myself something was seriously wrong with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a DRs appointment and 2 days before, my anxiety was getting so bad that I went to urgent care because I thought I was going to pass out or have a stroke. They gave me the all clear and I was able to calm down. I was so on edge the muscles in my shoulders and neck going up the back of my head felt like they were burning. My DR started me on 10mg lexapro and 25mg hydroxyzine, which have helped me tremendously. The hydroxyzine made me feel almost immediately better. I only took one dose of hydroxyzine since my DR really wants me to only take it as needed, and all the tension in my neck and shoulders has considerably subsided in only one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I haven&amp;#39;t had terrible anxiety over my health because I&amp;#39;m really trying to overcome this issue. Usually my anxiety never manifested this physically, it has always been 1 bad panic attack every once in awhile and that was it. It feels like this came out of nowhere and is starting to control my life. Anyone know how to make this easier?&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"So I’ve been trying to find a new part time job for 8 months now and after 27 applications (and some interviews) I’ve finally landed a job that perfectly meets my needs. 

I’ll basically be working with cats all day in a humane society and my hours are totally flexible with HIGHER pay than my current, more difficult job. 

I worked my first shift a few days ago and it went pretty well; nothing bad spoke out to me at all and I didn’t really feel anxious like I do at my current job, despite it being my first day. 

Today I went into my current retail job for a shift and after a lot of inner turmoil decided that I “might as well” just put in my two weeks now since there was no logical reason why I should wait any longer. 

I came home and told my parents about it and they both shook their heads, saying it was too soon and a bad decision. They said I might regret it and realize I like my current job more and will regret my decision. This has happened to me in the past and now I am haunted with anxious thoughts about my decision. 

I know this new job will be better for me - at the end of the day I get paid more anyways for less work. I can’t think of anything that would make this new job “not work.”

If this is confusing I apologize 

I’m so disturbed with how life is all in ones minds and brains. I keep getting fixated on how the brain works and how it retains memory. and getting creeped out with first person perspective. It feels so isolating and lonely. Not being able to see myself in the third person makes me uneasy sometimes.  Like how do I know something happened for sure. Why can’t I just exist and be like yes ok I’m living life and that happened and I do remember but then this thought of like but did it happen or are u hallucinating lmao.

Then I get sad that everything is just a figment of my imagination. What even is reality. I feel detached from myself. It’s like I’ve entered existential crisis mode. It’s hard to journal it’s hard to watch tv cos then I’m like what is really real. And how do I know language and stuff huh??? letters and the alphabet are all symbols and we make sounds with the words that all have meaning. Why does that freak me out. Everyone’s reality and experience is different so how do we know what the real reality is?? listening to music can be difficult sometimes to cos I’m like I’m all alone just listening to sounds???? Like like I’m so hypervigalent. Reading sometimes freaks me out cos I’m just like ??? Idk alone reading and then I’m like that requires my brain to remember what things are and I create Images and meaning in my head and then I get creeped out again. Like how does the brain just do these things???? Creepy like how do i know my parents exist if they’re not in front of me. i can think about them but that’s creepy. I’m just all in my head??? How do I know I’m real or others are real. 

im in therapy but it’s still hard talking about it cos I get creeped out again that I can’t see myself in the third person. But I’m getting necessary human interaction but the panic is still there.

,Anxiety,"I've flown all around the world. To Europe, to China, all across the United States so many times I can't count. I'm not afraid of planes or the concept of flying, I'm not afraid of crashing or anything like that.

However, for the past year (Last October 5th to be exact), I've been dealing with horrible anxiety when I am in situations where I feel like I can't leave. Stuck at a stop light, at a wedding during a ceremony, on a road trip that is only 3 hrs away (no way to get home if I need to), in an elevator even if it is only going up a few floors.

I've missed weddings, I've missed concert trips with friends, I've missed dinners, I sometimes can't even drive 15 minutes for an appointment because I'm scared of being trapped.

Last October, I had to get off a plane on the tarmac and have them take us all the way back to the gate just so I could get off in front of 150+ people.

***Anyways.... to the point.***

I finally made it to a wedding last week. I finally was able to sit in the passenger seat and feel like I wasn't in control as we drove 2 hours both ways, 2 days in a row. I was able to stand in front of 100+ people as a groomsman, unable to walk away, and be okay. I've been doing, I thought, a lot better. But now I fly tomorrow and I am freaking the fuck out. First, a 45 min flight and then a 2hr flight right after. I didn't expect that fear I felt a year ago to come back so heavily but it has.

So, I ask... how do I deal with that feeling once I'm in the sky? I can't let anxiety win. I can't get off a plane or deny another trip again when I've come so far.

&lt;p&gt;Last October, I had to get off a plane on the tarmac and have them take us all the way back to the gate just so I could get off in front of 150+ people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anyways.... to the point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally made it to a wedding last week. I finally was able to sit in the passenger seat and feel like I wasn&amp;#39;t in control as we drove 2 hours both ways, 2 days in a row. I was able to stand in front of 100+ people as a groomsman, unable to walk away, and be okay. I&amp;#39;ve been doing, I thought, a lot better. But now I fly tomorrow and I am freaking the fuck out. First, a 45 min flight and then a 2hr flight right after. I didn&amp;#39;t expect that fear I felt a year ago to come back so heavily but it has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I ask... how do I deal with that feeling once I&amp;#39;m in the sky? I can&amp;#39;t let anxiety win. I can&amp;#39;t get off a plane or deny another trip again when I&amp;#39;ve come so far. So, I&amp;#39;m asking for some tips to come back to earth when I feel trapped and my heart starts beating at 180/min and I have that primal need to run, get off, get away, get to safety.&lt;/p&gt;

Trigger warning: Mentions of an Eating disorder and Food anxiety. If this bothers you, scroll down. 


For the past 25 years, I lived with my Mom. 
Throughout my life, she was always very strict with food and often got angry if anyone of my siblings and I got food before she did and there wasn't enough left. Due to poverty, my Mom is terrified of food disappearing. So as we got older, we all learned to wait until our parents got food first and then got our food last. 

Due to my Eating Disorder, I have extreme anxiety about people looking at how much food I have on my plate. As a kid, my parents and siblings would make comments about how much or how little I would eat, so I began waiting until everyone else got their food before getting mine even if there was none left for the sake of not being yelled at or made to feel bad. 

Now I live with my boyfriend and his family. They aren't nearly as strict as my Mom was with food, but the anxiety never went away and I resent that I still have this issue. 
Today my boyfriend, his Dad, and I had a part to play in making dinner. Then out of nowhere, my boyfriend asks me if I want any garlic bread. At first I didn't know what to say. Then I said ""If there's any left sure. Then he's like ""It's a yes or no question."" Then I hear his Dad say ""Go get your food."" So I went to the bathroom before my boyfriend could stop me and I've locked myself in once again. I'm not coming out until they've all gotten their food. As much as I appreciate them not being strict, they can't just try to force me out of it by putting me in situations like this by trying to pressure me to get my food first, especially while people are f***ing watching me. 
I'm not having it.

Today my boyfriend, his Dad, and I had a part to play in making dinner. Then out of nowhere, my boyfriend asks me if I want any garlic bread. At first I didn&amp;#39;t know what to say. Then I said &amp;quot;If there&amp;#39;s any left sure. Then he&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a yes or no question.&amp;quot; Then I hear his Dad say &amp;quot;Go get your food.&amp;quot; So I went to the bathroom before my boyfriend could stop me and I&amp;#39;ve locked myself in once again. I&amp;#39;m not coming out until they&amp;#39;ve all gotten their food. As much as I appreciate them not being strict, they can&amp;#39;t just try to force me out of it by putting me in situations like this by trying to pressure me to get my food first, especially while people are f***ing watching me. 
I&amp;#39;m not having it. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I have been diagnosed with SAD since I was 12 and I am now 23. I have always been a very anxious person, but would consider myself high functioning for the most parts. I never let my anxiety affect my school or work and would tend to shove everything down until I got home, and then I’d have a meltdown. One important thing to note is nausea is a massive side effect I get when I’m experiencing anxiety. 

When I’m having a panic attack in public I just go mute. It’s a little strange to witness if you know me well, but if you are a customer or a stranger you wouldn’t think anything of it.

Last year I was prescribed Clonazepam for my anxiety as needed. This drug truly changed my life for the better. I got way more confident in myself and was able to accomplish things that I had avoided out of fear for my whole life.

2 months ago I quit an insanely toxic job. I noticed the job was making my anxiety way worse, plus was being verbally abused and manipulated by the owner. I was extremely anxious after I quit, since I did not have a new job lined up. Luckily I got a job 4 days after I walked out, so I felt a lot better.

This new job suits me a lot better. It’s a slower pace and everyone that works there is very kind. I am happy to go to work and genuinely enjoy the people I spend the day with. No one likes the idea of working, but for what it’s worth, it’s pretty good.

The past few weeks I’ve been getting super anxious before work. To the point where I had to leave early 3 times already in my short time being there. This really embarrasses me, as I want to leave a good impression on management. The worst part is I’m not sure why I’m so anxious or why my symptoms are so bad. I’m used to being nauseous, but I’m now throwing up a lot more and unable to keep food down. 2 days that I left I genuinely thought I was ill since I had flu like symptoms. I was dripping in cold sweat and very shaky. Nothing specifically triggered it, which confused me on the strong reaction. When I would get home and able to settle down, my symptoms would vanish aside from the loss in appetite. 

I’m frustrated with myself. I feel like i’m regressing with my anxiety by a lot. I have overcome so much since I graduated high school and I’m very proud of that, but now I feel like I’m going backwards. The worst part is exposure therapy is the best for my anxiety, but when I’m having symptoms like that I’m unable to push though. 

Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated, I’m at a loss on how to proceed. I’m afraid of being viewed at as lazy by my partner, family, and employer. I really want to work, but I can’t blame them for viewing me as lazy when I leave work 1 hour in.

,Anxiety,"This is a long one so here's the TL:DR  too many parts of my life are overwhelming me all at once and I'm struggling with trying to live / deal with it.

The big one right now is we have just filed for bankruptcy. Our household income is over 160k before taxes and we still cannot make ends meet. The majority of our issues come from medical debt,  and a second mortgage. 

I have three children (most likely s fourth) with ADHD/Autism and struggle with anxiety and depression. So you can imagine the kinds of bills that rack up for the three of them. With that come three separate stressors of their individual outbursts, triggers and what not. 

Because of the shortage of funds I'm forced to work overtime at my 12 hour rotating swing shift job that's physically taxing. Lately I've been throttling back the amount of stuff I do at work to try and reallocate my energy for more work around the house. This has caused management to notice a ""decrease in productivity"" and dropped ""team work"" score from a 4/5 to a 2/5 this will ultimately effect my raise next year so will be substantially lower. 

My house is in a constant state of disaster. Trying to ask my children to help with simple tasks results in fights, half ass done chores, or down right not doing them. My wife and I can't keep up with everything between the two of us, so when I get one day off of work, I spend it trying to get the house in some kind of order, getting next to no time to recover from the day of work. 

I fear that my truck is going to give out on my at any minute. It is no longer if, but when. It raddles on a cold start, and I've been told that it's the phasers going out. A 3K - 4K repair. However if it were to fail before I can save up the money, then the truck is shot and I'm out a vehicle. 

I've been diagnosed with a hypersomnia disorder that leaves me in a debilitating state where trying to stay awake is almost physically painful. Now I'm on a list of meds that looks like a CVS receipt. 

I feel completely overwhelmed. I'm taking one day at a time trying not to think about the long term. But I can't help but feel that oppressive shadow constantly looming above me. Ive bottled and stored my emotions until theyve become broken over and over again. My wife assures me, that we are ok. But I fail to believe it, given that we have to pick and choose week by week which builds we can pay, and wharves or not we can fill up on fuel for our two vehicles. 

I've been told I need to set aside time for myself to unwind. But every time I do, I notice there's just that much more not getting done and it will just sit there and wait for me until I'm done brooding or trying to distract myself.

,Anxiety,"I don’t usually post these kinds of things but I know when I first started my Sertraline journey I relied so heavily on these types of posts so here goes. 

It’s only when I compare my current self to my old self that I realise truly how unwell I was before sertraline and it’s bittersweet I must say, all those years I struggled through thinking it was normal to feel like I did makes me quite sad as man I wish I started this miracle drug 15 years ago so I didn’t ever have to suffer as much as I did. 

I have had crippling anxiety since I was 16, I have lost jobs, friends, relationships because of anxiety as I would struggle to leave the house at times and would lie about the reason why leading to people thinking I was just anti social, rude, a liar etc. I would have bouts of endless panic attacks coupled with severe months of depression and just horrible mental health. Fast forward to 30 and I THOUGHT I had it under control meaning I could hold down a job, occasionally go to social events albeit count down the minutes to when I could leave as I could not sit still and concentrate or enjoy anyone’s company, then out of nowhere, at work one day and I have the WORST panic attack of my life in front of a room of colleagues, the days following that were the worst I have had to the point I could not walk because of the tension in my legs from being so wound up, I could not even leave my home for a simple walk or speak to anyone other than my girlfriend without hyperventilating and I just felt so so weird all the time. 

Eventually I felt suicidal for the first time in my life and this scared me, so I arranged an appointment with my GP and said I have had enough of this and came clean to my friends and family etc with the extent I was struggling and told them I was going to try medication for the first time and I was feeling extremely anxious about this so please give me space for a few weeks (basically leave me alone lol) and everybody was amazingly supportive and helpful and respectful. 

I picked up my prescription and after a few hours of apprehension took my first pill. I felt amazing 1 hour later, most likely a placebo, but amazing. This wore off the next day, then the day after that I felt okay again. The third day, well all I can say is, my doctor did not prepare me for this. I had the worst anxiety of my life, brain zaps, severe dizziness and diarrhoea, zero appetite and panic attacks at random times of the day and night, I was sleeping 12 hours a day and thought I was going insane at times. This lasted for around a week then in the following weeks I started to feel noticeably better each day. Within 3 weeks of starting most of the side effects wore off other than still feeling slightly anxious and nervous and tired, I wasn’t feeling 100% still so I upped my dose from 50 to 100. 

The next 4 weeks was the strangest most amazing feeling I have ever had. Each day I was finding myself feeling better and better and not overthinking. Simple things like going to the shops weren’t a big task anymore and I would just get up and go without having any anxiety about it, stopping and speaking to a neighbour was seamless and I wouldn’t even notice until after how natural it was, I would catch myself thinking in ways I have never thought possible like planning trips and just getting up and doing things without worrying and over-planning. It was so strange (in a good way). 

It has now been 8 months roughly and I feel the best I have ever felt. Sometimes I cry for the old me thinking about how much I used to struggle daily and just accepted it. It makes me so sad to know how awful things were for me prior to this miracle drug. The initial side effects WILL pass, yes they are horrific and they can seriously affect you but trust me, it will get better. I am now on 125mg which is my sweet spot. My life is amazing, I socialise with no issues, I eat better because I have the time to think, I sleep better, I look better, my girlfriend is happier, my family are happier, I have had TWO promotions at work, I can get my haircut without shaking and sweating. 

If you are thinking of trying this drug because of anxiety all I can say is, please give it a try and give yourself the time to adjust. 

I’m sorry this is so long but I am so passionate about how life changing this drug has been for me. 

PS. I have to end on this, the Sertraline/Zoloft sh!ts are no joke, I was proud to say as an adult I had never sh!t myself….until 7/8 months ago…. you do the maths 😂

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry this is so long but I am so passionate about how life changing this drug has been for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. I have to end on this, the Sertraline/Zoloft sh!ts are no joke, I was proud to say as an adult I had never sh!t myself….until 7/8 months ago…. you do the maths 😂 &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I’ve been reading Lost Connections by Johann Hari, and it really made me rethink the mainstream understanding of anxiety and depression. The book suggests that a lot of what we experience as ‘depression’ or ‘anxiety’ might actually be a form of grief—grief over loss of connection, purpose, or even loved ones and parts of our identity. What stood out to me is that the idea of a ‘chemical imbalance’ being the cause of depression has been debunked by numerous studies that often don’t make it into the mainstream conversation. Hari points out that these studies show antidepressants might not work for most people, and he provides the references to back it up.

It got me wondering—what if, instead of just relying on meds, we’re really being called to grieve and heal from disconnection?

,Anxiety,"This is a long post you've been warned

I've had anxiety, low self esteem, and possibly BPD or something for as long as I can remember. I've always self-sabotaged my friendships, took things personally and got mad at people and cut them off quickly. But over the past 2 years, my trust in people, and my ability to regulate and practice mindfulness, and find some joy has pretty much disappeared.

My boyfriend watched this happen since our relationship began 2 years ago, and he wants his girlfriend back, but I don't recognize her anymore. I feel like this is me now, just a miserable, cranky, aggressive, frustrated, mean, toxic person who doesn't trust anyone, has no hope, and just wants to be entirely alone. I'm always uptight about a million things all at once. I used to be very goofy, and I loved making people laugh and smile. But when I was more happy and silly, people thought I was dumb and didn't take me seriously. I guess being angry people take you seriously but nobody wants to be around you

I used to listen to music in the car every time without fail; now, I generally just drive without music. I rarely do hobbies, and things that I used to love now don't really hit the same. I had faith in the universe/spirituality and people, but then my cat died of cancer in 2021 and I realized how the universe doesn't care who it kills or how, and that there are probably intelligent people who have a cure for cancer but choose to keep people/animals sick

I also lost a close friend because my own sensitivity and lack of trust in people. I just assumed something she said a year ago was a dig at me (it was admittedly rude), but instead of talking about it, I let it fester and pulled away. She pulled away too, and when she wanted to hang out finally, I decided to tell her I didn't think we should be friends. Neither of us communicated really, and I definitely didn't go about it in a healthy way. But we had similar interests, and I really enjoyed life when we hung out bc we were doing things that brought joy

On top of that, I've been seeing so many political posts on social media, and I've been getting very worked up at peoples' meanness towards each other. I end up getting so passionate and worked up, that I probably sound like a nutcase when I spend hours scrolling and commenting and getting worked up by things people say and do. People unfriend me on socials. It's like I'm watching myself from a distance, but this wasn't always me, or at least never this bad

I don't know if I can ever go back to the somewhat happier, fun, silly girl with lots of love and hope and trust in others and the universe. Even therapy doesn't work now because I don't trust that my own therapists like me; I don't trust that medications help because I've seen how shitty the side effects are and how they permanently alter our brains. 



I just don't know how people can be happy, like what is there to be happy about? Is it safe to be happy when there is so much cruelty all around us? Isn't that selfish? I haven't been sleeping either, and I keep losing hair. My relationship is on a thread, and my sex drive died a while ago. I just feel like a dead leaf withering away on the ground.

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone I’m 26 F who has been struggling with anxiety since the age of 7 when I first got diagnosed with OCD and GAD. During high school I was pretty heavily medicated (Zoloft max dose + abilify). The abilify had some side effects that weren’t pleaseant such as the weight gain and my psychiatrist took me off of it. I felt ok for a while after I adjusted to just taking Zoloft. after this in my college years, took the Zoloft I then went off of it to try to lose weight again and then my anxiety relapsed. I am now on 20 mg of Prozac after being brought down from 60 to 40 to now 20. I was really good on the 20 for a couple of months and then I forgot my medication when going on a trip and that just fucked things up that’s my mistake. I should’ve made sure to pack it. My ocd turned it into a thing where it was like oh, you forgot it then it’s meant to be. You shouldn’t be taking the medicine. It’s making you gain weight maybe now not taking it. Y where it was like oh, you forgot it then it’s meant to be. You shouldn’t be taking the medicine. It’s making you gain weight maybe now not taking it, you will lose weight. I understand that this thinking is very fucked up. My mental health should always go before me liking the way that I look or adhering to societal standards, but I was doing so well on the Prozac, I felt like it was finally time to stop taking the medicine, which is something that needs to be done while supervised by a psychiatrist.

(Sorry in advance if this sounds weird I’m using talk to text) 

After stopping the Prozac in July of this year, I felt fine until late September. That’s when shit hit the fan. 
Currently I feel like I’m in a health anxiety relapse. I have been having a really good year, panic attack free for 7 months and then boom, the other night out of nowhere I had to stop in the middle of the road because of the existential anxiety I was having. I started thinking of how we are all going to die and the nothingness of death and couldn’t bare the thought. After that 1 week later a similar but more intense attack took over, probably one of the worst I’ve had in history. I had the existentialism and then boom I got left arm pain and chest pain and I was for sure going to die in my head. There was no avoiding it, I was dying (according to my thoughts at the time). I was physically jerking I couldn’t keep my arms and legs still. Somehow I controlled the urge to call 911, hours later then I calmed down. Since then I have had a looming sense of panic and anxiety, convinced that what I’m dealing with is not anxiety but actually my body telling me that something is very, very wrong. I went to the doctor and she ran a bunch of tests to check for autoimmune disorders and everything came back fine except for my platelets being elevated (460-normal range is like 130-400 I believe) and my WBC was a 11 (1 number above normal). She said that it’s probably due to a UTI and I have to to back in to repeat the blood work. Dr Google has convinced me that the platelet level is because of a blood clot. I called 911 the other day for the first time in years, they came Did an EKG and said all is good except for your BPM is a bit high due to anxiety. I didn’t go to the hospital. Well, that night I thought that I was going to get some sleep due to the relief of the EKG being fine, but in reality, I got worse and didn’t sleep one bit. I have a work event that I needed to travel for and was running on no sleep. I tried to sleep in the car since the trip was pretty long, but could not fall asleep.  when we got to our hotel there were bedbugs, a severe amount of them, and we had to evacuate to a different hotel at 1am. I then tried to go to sleep again and then with no luck could not fall asleep at 4 AM. I decided that I wasn’t able to handle this anymore and went to the ER. Atn the ER they did a blood analysis. I told them that I was having some pain in my shoulder and my arm, which I have been having for a while and they did a chest x-ray and didn’t find anything. They gave me some Ativan, which really did calm me down Was able to sleep for about an hour in the hospital with that. They then said that they were able to release me. I asked them if they did a dimer to check for a blood clot and they said that they wasn’t necessary. I’m not someone who argues or pushes back with medical professional so I did not want to say anything but now that is the only thing in my mind that is not allowing me to fully relax, thankfully when I got back to the hotel the Ativan was still in my system and allowed me to finally get some sleep. I slept for four hours. I am now awake I’m not hungry. I have no appetite. I feel constrained to my bed and fear of any movements will cause my anxiety to start going up again. I’m already scared that I have a blood clot due to the pain in my left arm that I’ve been having. I’m not sure what to do at this point. I see a therapist once weekly. I see my psychiatrist often. I’m on 20 mg of Prozac. She’s currently seeing if she can prescribe me Ativan to take when I have these panic attacks. There’s nothing that I’m able to do that calms me down watching TV makes me anxious talking to friends at this point makes me anxious as well. I feel like I just want to be put to sleepand it’s funny because I want to be put to sleep but the thing that I’m scared of is dying so it’s very strange situation. I’m at my wits end.

I tried to sleep in the car since the trip was pretty long, but could not fall asleep.  when we got to our hotel there were bedbugs, a severe amount of them, and we had to evacuate to a different hotel at 1am. I then tried to go to sleep again and then with no luck could not fall asleep at 4 AM. I decided that I wasn’t able to handle this anymore and went to the ER. Atn the ER they did a blood analysis. I told them that I was having some pain in my shoulder and my arm, which I have been having for a while and they did a chest x-ray and didn’t find anything. They gave me some Ativan, which really did calm me down Was able to sleep for about an hour in the hospital with that. They then said that they were able to release me. I asked them if they did a dimer to check for a blood clot and they said that they wasn’t necessary. I’m not someone who argues or pushes back with medical professional so I did not want to say anything but now that is the only thing in my mind that is not allowing me to fully relax, thankfully when I got back to the hotel the Ativan was still in my system and allowed me to finally get some sleep. I slept for four hours. I am now awake I’m not hungry. I have no appetite. I feel constrained to my bed and fear of any movements will cause my anxiety to start going up again. I’m already scared that I have a blood clot due to the pain in my left arm that I’ve been having. I’m not sure what to do at this point. I see a therapist once weekly. I see my psychiatrist often. I’m on 20 mg of Prozac. She’s currently seeing if she can prescribe me Ativan to take when I have these panic attacks. There’s nothing that I’m able to do that calms me down watching TV makes me anxious talking to friends at this point makes me anxious as well. I feel like I just want to be put to sleepand it’s funny because I want to be put to sleep but the thing that I’m scared of is dying so it’s very strange situation. I’m at my wits end. I don’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I (31m) am writing this post and stepping outside of my comfort zone completely. I never post on social media, I rarely talk to anyone except my three close mates. I hope it can help or bring hope to someone else. 

I suffered health anxiety for over 2 years. I’m talking deliberating, curled up in a ball, going to the doctor twice a week with made up scenarios or ways I was going to die. I think the local hospital staff knew me by first name too.  I work in a trade, so talking about mental health really isn’t a thing. 

My GP prescribed sertraline in the early days, but I never took it with fears that I’d have an allergic reaction to it( I have no known allergies).. I spent hours going through reddit and google finding reasons to not take the sertraline. 
I also thought “I don’t need it” and “why are they just trying to drug me”. 

I spent the next few months thinking I had lost the plot, the odd suicidal thought, wanting to close my business, I couldn’t even talk to people on the phone anymore. 

It would take someone just saying they felt sick for me to pack up, go home and spiral all afternoon. 

After around one year, one night I was spiraling for about 2 hours, talking to my finance about how certain I was that I had a brain tumour but the doctors have missed it, it was the only thing that made sense for all the sudden anxiety and other issues. 
She broke down, uncontrollably crying. She couldn’t say a word, but I knew what she was crying about, it was that she had spent a year listening to me, she didn’t have anyone to talk to herself, she was just bottling it all up. She had never done that in front of me before. 

It was at that point that I took the leap and took my first sertraline tablet. 
I kept taking them daily as prescribed and boy oh boy, when I say magic pill I mean it!! Within 3 weeks there was noticeable changes to my mood. Within 5 weeks the negative thoughts were disappearing. 

Now I know what those of you with anxiety might be thinking, “well I don’t want to be drugged up” 
Please listen to me, this drug clears your mind so you can reflect on everything that has been going on. I am in no way a doctor or scientist, but something about balancing the chemicals in your brain?? Idk. But it worked. 

I spent the next 9 months taking sertraline, going to therapy as normal, and once I felt comfortable, I stopped taking it. 

I am now going on 1 year with no sertraline, minimal health anxiety, and a much happier life than I was before my health anxiety kicked off!

I still get the odd little “don’t eat that you’ll die from an allergic reaction” but I’m able to shut it down very quickly. 

I am writing this post to hopefully help someone that needs it.

And one piece of advice, don’t trust everything you read online, everyone posts a bad experience, but not everyone posts a good experience.

,Anxiety,"So my anxiety regarding work has been pretty severe recently, I work in the care sector where decisions I make can impact on client care and generally I am good at my job to the point I have just been promoted. 

I am a naturally anxious person and tend to catastrophise a lot all focused around my work. In part I think it makes me better as I am constantly on edge thinking of different scenarios but sometimes I make dumb choices and mistakes that leave me questioning why I am so stupid.

For example my clients patio is pretty slippery at the moment so I made sure to lower risks as much as I could whilst I looked at getting someone to jet wash. I agreed our sister company could do it but it would take them a week +. I know it needed to be done before that but the people pleaser in me said that was ok. I was also thinking that it will probably take me just as long to arrange someone else to do it so I’ll just agree for them to do it. Just been emailed by my manager who very kindly pointed out as it’s a health and safety risk that I could find someone sooner. 

My brain is spiralling that I am the worst at my job, that they’re going to fire me, that someone is definitely going to slip tonight and die and it will be my fault so I’ll end up in court. Like they now know I’m incompetent and should take the job off me. 

I feel embarrassed and dumb because I KNEW THAT. I have no idea why my brain decided to ignore what I knew.

,Anxiety,"So, this is a weird one, and I'm trying to find out if others have experienced this. Whenever I try to take a nap during the day, or within the first hour or so of falling asleep at night, I'll wake up a few times with this absolutely terrible feeling of anxiety/dread.

I suffer from terrible depression and anxiety, but I've noticed that it's particularly bad when I've been asleep for a few minutes but have not yet entered into deep sleep. There is something about the process of switching the brain off that jolts me back awake after 15 or 20 minutes, and I'll feel this horrible dread, like I'm standing at the gates of hell or something. After a few minutes of being back awake it fades away.

Once I enter deep sleep I still sometimes wake up during the night (general insomnia), and the anxiety/depression is  still there, but it's not as acutely piercing as early in the sleep process.

,Anxiety,"I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m in therapy, had the third session today. I have GAD.

Two days ago, I was under a lot of anxiety and stress that is mostly caused by my relationship. I decided that I need to drive to the hospital because I couldn’t calm myself anymore. The doc prescribed me anti-depressants (mirtazapin) and I took them. Yesterday I went to my GP that got me checked up. The doctor made an ECG-scan to see if everything is alright with my heart and general health. The GP also prescribed me something called temesta to calm my nerves when it really gets out of hand. I felt so good yesterday. Today is an awful to okay-ish day. I had the third therapy session today and told this to my therapist. She was okay with it and that it’s okay that I searched help outside of the sessions. I just should check up the anti-depressants with a doctor, but everything else she agreed on. She was shocked that they gave me those pills at the hospital, but she seems fine with it, too. 



My whole life I had so much anxiety but I started to recognize it some weeks ago. You have to know, I’m in a 6-year old relationship and we had so much conflict 3 months ago that we said it can’t go on like this, something has to change. We pretty much took a “break” (i was on vacation alone, we still had minimal contact) of 10 days and started over again. Now, my anxiety and mental health got worse the last 3 weeks and my bf, who is also in therapy (he now has diagnosed ADHD), made some realizations about him in our relationship and about himself. He says that he can’t decide whether we can work through our problems or if he should break up with me. He says he doesn’t know if he can let me in anymore. He asks me if I can let him in anymore.



I’m thankful that he is honest with me but this took me out of everything. The last 5 days I've been constantly spiraling. Thinking about the “maybe break-up”. My thoughts go to music that we enjoyed together and I’m thinking about that we won’t ever enjoy it again. I’m thinking about Discord servers that I have to leave because he is in there. I’m thinking about our bedroom and bed where I will be laying alone once he leaves. I’m thinking about all the good memories we shared together that I’m afraid to think of those memories again. I’m thinking about being all alone again and it terrifies me so much. I’m constantly preparing for the breakup because I’m afraid that it will hurt. I don’t know how I should just accept it and see where things go. I just want to feel something again when I get a hug from him, I just want things to go back like they were 2 years ago.



And this is making me cling onto him again. I started doing things that I didn’t do before. When he is on the phone I’m wondering to whom he is writing and if he is writing and complaining about our relationship. I’m constantly checking his reddit accounts if he asks for advice about us. And then I’m talking to him about our relationship and what he thinks about it and we talk about it about 4 hours a day and it drains him so much. He said to me that he just wants two weeks where he doesn’t have to worry about those things and just be happy.



I understand him. I want it too. But I don’t feel secure and I’m going crazy because of it. I can’t calm my nerves because I’m always spiraling back. God damn, I just want to feel loved and give love and not have so much to worry about.



**Does anyone have some tips on how I can accept that he really wants to try it and that I don’t have to deal with the breakup right now, as there is none?** 



**TL;DR: bf of 6years triggers my anxiety, can’t calm my nerves, already stressing about break up even if there is no final say. I need help to calm me and think about what I want, too**

,Anxiety,"Strangely enough this is my first Reddit post. I feel like people on here, based off social media, actually care about others and can relate in specific ways. 

This year has been a bit of a wild ride for me. I had to go back on anxiety medication due to myself having a sense of derealisation and being a hypochondriac about health in a sense. It’s been 6 or so months since I have been on my treatment. For the most part it helps me out. However I do have a few strange days, weird thoughts and subtle anxiety still. 

My medication consists of lexamil (escitalopram) 20mg, a 10 mg beta blocker and as adco-alazam to take in case of a serious panic attack. 

I am a catholic person and have a strong morality. Which begs the question, why do I have such obscene, obsessive, intrusive, odd and absurd thoughts on most days? 

Examples of this would be:

1.  Thoughts about life and what is there at the end of it? Even though I believe in my god. 
2. Having violent intrusive thoughts for no reason at all. For example hurting my pet cat even though I never would.
3. I think mostly I’m extremely scared of losing my mind (literally in tears typing this out). Scared of having a psychotic break I guess. 
4. Why is this happening? I was and am a perfectly healthy 22 year old male.

I guess my questions to the supportive and understanding people is: How can I better myself and cope with these thoughts? Is there something actually wrong with me? Genetically speaking is there something wrong with me? 


Generally speaking I think I am a happy person, I obviously have my quirks but yeah. Work life is pretty nice (I work at home ) and my family and friends are amazing.

,Anxiety,"Heads up: I'm going to describe things related to a panic attack and mention fainting, so if it's something that makes you uneasy or causes you anxiety, feel free to skip this one &lt;3

  
I don't know how to explain this, but I want to know if others experience it too: When I'm having a panic attack, my vision feels like it just stops working? It doesn't go black like when you're fainting, but it feels more like my brain just stops registering what I'm seeing.

,Anxiety,"Hello all. For about 12 years now I have had what I would consider a general anxiety disorder that would come in waves and always would get bad in certain circumstances. 

I’ve always known at my core what the cause of my anxiety was but I ignored it for a long time. After the first year or two it started seeping into all aspects of my life. What started as anxiety towards one thing became anxiety towards everything. It felt like I couldn’t feel an emotion without anxiety being attached to it. 

About a month ago I was forced to face my problem. I had the craziest panic attack of my life for 5 days straight. Constantly sweating, elevated heart rate, I lost about 10 pounds. It was one of the worst experiences I’ve ever gone through. Eventually I came out of the other side and ever since then I have had 0 anxiety. I don’t fully understand it but it has been absolutely amazing. I can feel things without the weight in my chest and constant feeling of unease. 

The problem is I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore. I think I was always doing things, acting certain ways, avoiding conflict, purely to avoid my anxiety flaring up. Now I find myself behaving certain ways out of habit and realizing halfway through that it’s not who I am…if that makes sense. As I type this out I’m realizing it’s hard to explain. For example, I thought I didn’t like certain things because I didn’t like them but I’m realizing I was just avoiding stuff because it gave me anxiety. I thought I was just introverted but I actually was just anxious and I’m getting lonely because I’ve lost a lot of friends over the years from not seeing them. Am I even extroverted though? I don’t know. I’ve stopped so many hobbies due to anxiety and picked up other ones I can do alone but now I feel like I don’t even like those. I’m so confused. 

Curious if anyone has experienced anything similar? I feel really lost and like I’ve been living a lie for years and years and I don’t know how to rediscover myself.

For about 12 years now I have had what I would consider a general anxiety disorder that would come in waves and always would get bad in certain circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always known at my core what the cause of my anxiety was but I ignored it for a long time. After the first year or two it started seeping into all aspects of my life. What started as anxiety towards one thing became anxiety towards everything. It felt like I couldn’t feel an emotion without anxiety being attached to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a month ago I was forced to face my problem. I had the craziest panic attack of my life for 5 days straight. Constantly sweating, elevated heart rate, I lost about 10 pounds.

,Anxiety,"Hey guys,

In every job I had, I tend to learn quickly and be very effective in a few month ( I would say Im productive at 200%). I think it is because I am scared of fail, and be judged on my skills and emotions. So I triple the work by being very productive and be smiling and friendly.

Inside I am most of the time frustrated, because I see other people working slow, and I double my tasks to take them, and get the work done. 

I tried to low my productivity, in order to avoid burning out, and frustration, but when I slow down I am still at 100%.

Colleagues lay on me because they know if they procrastinate, I'd ""crack"" and do it for them.

When I try not to do their tasks, and slowing mine, I am litteraly boiling inside because I have the impression of loosing my time, and I want to go home.

Anyone else is speed at work due to anxiety and try to reduce their productivity and accept being slower, going home later and be happy I guess ?

I feel lonely in this case.
I could give more details if needed, as I have speed urges, as if I was switching when I watch the clock and start rushing everything (resulting in getting more and more tasks)...

,Anxiety,"Last night my older sister called me in a panic, because my Dad had a huge gash on the left side of his forehead. You could see his skull through the injury. He passed out, while carrying huge heavy planks of wood, and hit his head on something while having a seizure. We had no idea what happened or why the guy who witnessed this event did not take him to the hospital immediately.. it really infuriated me, cause he just dropped my Dad off at home while he was unconscious..

Well, today rolls around and we find out he has a huge tumor in his brain. It’s almost the size of a big orange. The doctor said he speculated the tumor was meninggioma, but couldn’t give a definite answer without doing further test. They decided against it due to the amount of blood veins that are in that area surrounding the tumor. It’s been an interesting day..

My Dad had fought with addiction for over 25 years almost. I have mixed emotions about this all. Part of me feels emotionless and another side of me just feels angry about this all.. because due to the addiction, it has really made him decline in his health a lot over the years. Dad is going to be 58 next month. I am 32. It’s so surreal that when your parents life is in jeopardy, you feel a sense that it’s not actually real and in denial, while also acknowledging the truth of the situation to yourself. 

I’m flabbergasted. I felt the pain of if he were to die, then cried, and stopped when I fact checked myself about the situation. It’s in the unknown. I understand this is apart of life.. just never feels like it’s really going to happen until the moment of your vitality comes into play when facing death in a situation like this..

For so many years, I had nothing to do with my Dad. Many people can say shame on an individual for being like that, but when you have a parent who is fighting this disease of addiction, you only stay away from it because you don’t want to watch your loved one destroy themselves anymore… it’s like watching someone sit in front of you sawing their limbs off with a blade… it’s graphic, horrific, and really gives you a perspective of cause and affect/effect.

Drugs really suck. So many may think that loved ones do not suffer as much as the addict from it, and yet it feels that way. I’m mad that my Mom, sisters, and myself have had to experience this.. it’s almost like we suffered from drugs ourselves, yet we’ve never done them before in our lives..

It’s a bad experience I turned into a good in my life. I chose, rather than to be a victim of these problems forever and do the same thing, to be a survivor and use these experiences for something good.. 

Now it’s coming down to this.. life and death.. and shock that it’s actually happening to where this is a real thing. He could die from this. Has he yet? No. ..

They are planning to do surgery on his brain to remove the mass.. I’m afraid of this though.. even if it is a fact that it is a course of action that would have to be taken. I think that’s normal. 

We have already lost the Dad who was sober and loving in a way where it felt humble.. then drugs killed that side of him.. locked it away .. what seems like for good due to dealing with this the majority of my life.. I still remember him before all of this and hold on to that.. both my older sister and I do. I don’t really feel like my little sister knows any better than the addict. Both me and my older sister remember him before all of this happened. Yet, now the relationship has been built back up, accepting that he’s an addict, and now this happening.. which could cause further brain damage. I’m worried, but also confident in these doctors abilities z

This is a lot to take in and a wild thing to realize this is where we have ended up throughout our journey in life..

I’m staying strong and refuse to break in front of anyone. I feel like I need to be strong for my sisters and other loved ones.. I think when the moment comes it will just happen authentically.

I have always had a very severe issue with anxiety and being late. If I'm running late to being early, I risk having a panic attack. It sucks. I don't like it. In school, I'd be rushing in the hallways to make it to class as early as I could possibly manage. If I was late to being early, I'd start panicking. 

Being late is a 'normal' thing that happens to the best of us sometimes, but I just cannot handle it. Today my alarm on my new phone didn't wake me up, and I was late to work. I had a panic attack. It scared the shit out of me. This is the first time I've been late to anything in years. Maybe honestly ever.

My boss didn't care at all, he was very understanding but it still really freaked me out a LOT. I have ADHD as well and apparently its common for people w/ ADHD to be late to things. Is my anxiety overriding my ADHD or something?? (Mostly joking with this statement lol.)

Having health anxiety sucks. Because no matter how insignificant, small, and completely explainable my pain is, my dumb slime of a brain will indeed google it, and will indeed be scared after it *potentially* is serious. 

As if my blood tests haven't came out very well, and i was diagnosed to be very healthy.
It's getting to me.

 A slightest ache, a slightest itch, fuck, a slightest touch that seems off, sends me into dread that I'm dying, going to be in pain for years to come, that it won't ever go away, that it's serous, i have a potentially hardly treatable ilness, or a serous ilness in general, that it's only surgically treatable, that it will hurt more and more and i HATE pain, that google is indeed telling me the worst is gonna happen.

It's gotten to the point im starting to think about sicknesses I don't even have symptoms of, thinking i might have them, or something bad is about to happen.
 Example: testicular torsion can't leave my mind because of how horrifying it sounds. And after having inflammation, *every*, *single*, *itch*, touch, or any slight feeling in my testis throws my fear factor into 6th gear.

At this point it's an obsession, I'm going crazy over slightest of pain, that I don't know what caused. I immediately label it as life treating/extremely painful/serious.

 A slight pain in hips because im recovering from obesity? Kidney failure. 
Anxiety caused chest pain? Heart attack. Groin pain from muscle strain that radiates to my testis? Incoming testicular torsion and even cancer.
Stomach pain due to constipation? Liver failure and kidney's death, kidney stones.
Random body ache? Must mean the closest organ is giving up.
Palpitation? Im probably already dead.

I don't wanna live like this. Seriously. Im not the healthiest of eaters, in fact my ""diet"" is absolutely awful, but all my tests i did said im in good condition. And they continue to do. And yet, i feel like my time has come, for the fourth year in a row now. I don't know what to do. My family thinks im a lunatic and crazy over this.

Luckily my friends are super supportive and counter what my family tells me.

,Anxiety,"2 years ago was the first time I experienced anxiety, I’m 24 (was 22). Had two horrible weeks of just feeling sick all the time, not wanting to go out, horrible horrible scary thoughts about something happening to people I love, my brain was non stop and couldn’t sleep. talked to my psychologist for two sessions, put all my effort into sleeping well and reduced my weekend/going out/ drinking. (I was in university so had an active nightlife which didn’t help). Slowly after 4-5 days of focusing on that my anxiety left. Ever since then I get sliiightly anxious very very rarley I’d say every 5 months I have one bad day and then it goes. These past 2 weeks I went out, traveled a long trip (hours of no sleep and jet lag) and my brain is throwing scary thoughts at me again, started as health anxiety which i had never had before and now just feel sad and worried plus physical side effects like an upset stomach and I’m just so scared to spiral into how my anxiety was 2 years ago. I have a psychologist appointmenr on monday and am trying really hard to sleep and rest a lot plus working out and eating healthy. Hope it will go away soon.

,Anxiety,"I met this girl about a month ago. We clicked right away and could read and understand each other so well. We sat for hours together, sharing our thoughts and experiences, truly connecting.

The first few times we hang out were so much fun. We’d spend all day together and time would pass so easily, it felt so calm and peaceful. It’s like we jumped right into being besties. We planned so many fun things to do together.

Around the third week though, I started getting that all too familiar sick feeling. My mind started racing whenever we’d hang out.  I think we were really starting to care deeply and feel for each other at this point. It’s something I crave so much. But I think it terrifies me more than anything too and since then, my mind has been screaming at me to run. It’s coming up with any excuse imaginable to end the friendship. Like maybe I really don’t enjoy her company anymore? Before we get too close and get even more hurt. Now when we hang out, it’s clouded by a heavy fog of anxiety. It’s so intense now, I’m feeling anxious pretty much all week.

I don’t know what to do. She is such a kind, awesome person. But I can’t shut off the anxiety and it’s becoming unbearable. I’m familiar with attachment theory and believe I may be fearful avoidant. I went through an extremely traumatic breakup (I initiated it) at the beginning of the year and believe this might be adding to the anxiety too? Even though we both clearly communicated that we do not see each other in a romantic way, a lot of patterns of our friendship, the speed we connected, the depth, her abandonment trauma closely resemble my previous relationship and it’s sending alarm signals off in my mind. This overwhelming feeling of being trapped and that I’m going to hurt her by running is so intense now.

I really need help, any advice please.

Basically im looking for advice on how to gain confidence to have a better social life, become less anxious, and especially do better with girls. Any advice helps!&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"My HA started when I started bleeding with bowel movements. At the time I was extremely sick with symptoms that aligned with colon cancer. Loosing weight, loose stools, ribbon stools, going more than usual and of course blood. 

I was only 19 but it didn’t matter and I didn’t get a colonoscopy till I was 24 and didn’t have to go through Kaiser and was all clear other than internal hemorrhoids. I am 26 now and to this day when I bleed I convince myself they missed something and it’s colon cancer.

,Anxiety,"So, for some reason I've decided to make this post, even though I normally never post anything anywhere and don't have any social media. But after dealing with a myriad of mental health issues (including trauma, emotional abuse, anxiety and depression) for years now, I thought that if sharing this might help someone else even a little bit, then it's probably worth it.  
So here we go. I will try to list the most important strategies/tips/reminders which I find helpful on a bad day. There're written in no particular order of importance, and I might come back to this list at some point and add or adjust some things, but here's what has helped me so far.

**1. Don't wallow in it**  
It's easy to let yourself fell miserable when you're not at your best, and especially at your worst. It's easy to feel like things will never get better, and you'd be better off not existing. Letting your mind relax into it and give in to the cloud is not helping. I find that if I start pitying myself and thinking things like ""oh why can't anything ever just go right in my life"", I sink even further down, and that's obviously not helping anything.

**2. Reach out to someone, if you can**  
This one can be particularly hard for me sometimes. I don't have (and have never really had) a good close relationship or any kind of connection with my family. They also live in a different country, which I don't ever intend to go back to. At this point in my life, I have no partner and about two or three really close friends who I love and can candidly talk to about my issues, but as any adults, they all also have their own lives, problems and families, so I can't expect them to be there every single time I have a crisis. Unfortunately (or luckily?) I've had a lot of experience having to deal with difficult things completely on my own, as so many of us have to. I believe that, in many ways, that loneliness has made me more resilient, but when you're feeling down that same loneliness can sometimes also really kick your ass. So if you're lucky enough to have a good supportive social circle, let them know how you're feeling, try to open up, or even just invite someone over for a cuppa or go for a walk together. Simply not being alone (and lonely) the majority of the time can already help minimize/manage feelings of isolation and disassociation.

**3. Don't forget your hobbies and things that bring you joy**  
Anxiety often overclouds your life, giving you tunnel vision. For me, whenever I get a particularly heavy anxiety attack, I obsessively (and involuntarily) focus on that one thing that's driving me mad, and everything else kinda becomes muted and greyed out. Or so it seems - but it actually isn't. The things you like to do, or used to like to do, might seem really trivial and small at the time but they're not. There is still joy to experience and fun to have. Whatever it is that you might've loved before or have always wanted to try - do it.

**4. Exercise and go outside**  
This part can probably be found in every single mental health-related guideline/book/post. And no, it won't make it all better. Going to the gym or for a walk won't magically cure all your ailments. But it's about taking care of the basic needs of your body (which the mind is a part of). You need nutrition, you need sunlight, you need movement, you need other people. So many things that are already bad can become so much worse if those basics are neglected.

**5. Get educated on it and do your own research**  
You are unique. Your situation is unique. Your mind is unique. Your childhood, your upbringing and your circumstances are unique. Your triggers are unique. There is no ""one size fits all"" remedy for your particular mental health struggles, so I would encourage anyone and everyone to educate themselves about their condition(s), get information from reliable resources, try out different strategies for managing whatever is bothering you, and basically get to know yourself better by doing so.

**6. Don't rely on food/drugs/alcohol/shopping or other addictive substances and behaviours**  
Short-term fixes feel great, but they can breed further disfunction. We all long for that serotonin/dopamine kick, especially when we're not doing well. But deep down I bet you know that burger won't make you feel better, that high will be followed by a crash, and that fancy bag will just collect dust in your closet. It's like putting a bandaid on an infected would - you won't have to look at how gross it is anymore, but the infection underneath won't heal.   
  
**7. Sleep is underrated**  
This one kinda goes hand in hand with #4. Studies after studies have shown that sleep-deprived people are at much higher risk for developing various mental health issues in the long run. Feeling fatigued and constantly tired can also make you more vulnerable and emotional. I sometimes have nights where I need 3-4 hours (and a sleeping pill) to finally fall asleep, and it makes me absolutely miserable. I've also found that I have the most trouble falling asleep after a mentally exhausting day, which feels extremely unfair - I'm beat, but my body doesn't get the message. In those cases, listening to some music can sometimes be a good alternative to medication, which I always try to avoid taking if I can.

**8. Keep your mind and body busy with good things**  
Aka ""good distractions"". Basically it's about getting yourself out of your mind. I find that even simple chores, like wiping down the kitchen counters or finally folding my laundry after a week is a much more productive use of my time than sitting on the couch while my brain is on fire once again. It also kind of breaks apart that haze I often get stuck in, where I'm sitting on the couch literally motionless, mentally listing everything that's wrong with my life, wondering why do I have to feel so miserable all the time. Well, I don't. I do have (some) power over it. My choices matter. 

**9. A clean, clutter-free environment can help declutter the mind as well**  
This is something that's big for me - I absolutely hate living in a messy/cluttered place. It makes me feel like there's something weighing down on my mind. I often purge my closet of things I haven't worn in a long time, or go through all my drawers clearing out useless junk. I'm not the biggest fan of cleaning, but I often feel a lot better after I've finally gotten off the couch and cleaned something. Living alone with two cats also kind of forces me to be organized, because nobody else is gonna do it for me and the cats have to be taken care of. But like so many others, I often struggle with motivation, or have to literally force myself to take out the trash or vacuum. Basic stuff like this can be really hard when you're in a pit. But letting it become worse and worse can, in turn, exacerbate your mental and emotional unwellness.

**10. Journaling &amp; practicing gratitude**  
I suck at this, but it is so important. Journalling basically lets you dump out and quiet down all the bees that have been humming non-stop inside your brain, gratitude shifts your perspective on things. It might seem silly to get excited about something as small and (in the grand scheme of things) unimportant as a delicious morning coffee for example, but it's all about reminding yourself that life isn't all just pain and agony - there *are* still good things in it.

**11. Meditation**  
It took me a while to really understand it, and I definitely still wouldn't call myself a master of meditation. I also don't do it often enough. But I've learned how powerful it can be, and how important grounding and mindfulness is for literally every aspect of life. What worked best for me was an app called Calm - it offers an extensive catalogue of guided (great for beginners) and non-guided meditations, as well as soundscapes, music, sleep stories, and much more.

**12. Appropriate and healthy nutrition is key**  
Same point as in #4 and #7, really. By ""appropriate"" nutrition I mean whatever is right for you. You might have a very sensitive stomach like myself, so even eating something healthy like a salad can sometimes cause trouble. Or you might have food intolerances, allergies, or other underlying conditions, so your appropriate nutrition might be very different from mine. However, I think we can all pretty much agree on what's healthy and what isn't. Food is one of the few things in life that you can absolutely control, and helping your body out in such important aspects as supporting the immune system, digestion and muscle strength can and will help your mind as well.

**13. Art (music, literature, design, etc)**  
I absolutely love cinema, books, music and graphic design. There's quite a lot of things (like favorite movies/books/songs) that I can pretty much always come back to and rely on when I'm feeling down. Art can be extremely powerful - it can show you that you're now alone in what you're feeling, that others have been there too, and managed to overcome their own personal hell. It can also be quite therapeutic to be transported to another world, on paper or on screen, and get a break from your reality when it's getting you down. Some of the best life lessons I've learned literally come from Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. And while some people find it disturbing and loud, I often find comfort in my favorite post-hardcore songs. Somebody once asked me why I like that kind of music, and I said ""*They scream so I don't have to*"".

**14. Try therapy if you can**  
I haven't been lucky in this regard (so far), and the therapist I did work with unfortunately didn't help me at all. Pretty much everything that I've found to be helpful for my particular situation I have found on my own. I know that therapy is, sadly, not always available to everyone, either for financial, geographical or other reasons, but I would strongly encourage anyone who's struggling to try it, in whatever form you have access to - it might even just be an app or a therapist you can text with. Whatever works and feels right for you.

**15. Being present &amp; mindful**  
In a world full of distractions and overstimulation, being present in the moment has become a difficult task that you actively need to practice to remember. Unfortunately, we do so many things without even thinking about it, and a lot of those things are not helpful to us at all. Breaking down that autopilot can help you regain control over your life in many different ways, and become aware of the choices you're making and how they're impacting your wellbeing.

**16. Refocus your attention from yourself onto others**  
This one is kind of an echo of #1. When you're overly (obsessively) focused on yourself and your own issues, they become bigger and bigger in your mind, until there's no room in there for anything or anyone else, just you and your misery. I find that focusing my attention on others (like my friends, colleagues or my cats) helps me find value in my own existence again. I feel great if I'm able to help someone out or make someone laugh, or see my cats enjoying the snacks I gave them. Humans are inherently selfish creatures, and depression can make it even worse by giving you that tunnel vision. It can be easy to forget that there's a whole world out there, other people (and animals) that are struggling, people you could help. Whether it's volunteering or just helping a friend move - you are not useless. You can make a difference, however tiny it may seem.

If you read this all the way to the end - wow, look at you! Thanks!  
I don't know how many people this post will reach, but something good has to come of of my suffering, so if you found any of this helpful, I'm honestly really glad.",t2_nf7jid44q,False,,0,False,My strategies for dealing with anxiety and depression,[],r/Anxiety,False,,healthflair,0,,,False,t3_1gaznx0,False,light,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Health,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1729766842.0,text,,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for some reason I&amp;#39;ve decided to make this post, even though I normally never post anything anywhere and don&amp;#39;t have any social media. But after dealing with a myriad of mental health issues (including trauma, emotional abuse, anxiety and depression) for years now, I thought that if sharing this might help someone else even a little bit, then it&amp;#39;s probably worth it.&lt;br/&gt;
So here we go. I will try to list the most important strategies/tips/reminders which I find helpful on a bad day. There&amp;#39;re written in no particular order of importance, and I might come back to this list at some point and add or adjust some things, but here&amp;#39;s what has helped me so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Don&amp;#39;t wallow in it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It&amp;#39;s easy to let yourself fell miserable when you&amp;#39;re not at your best, and especially at your worst. It&amp;#39;s easy to feel like things will never get better, and you&amp;#39;d be better off not existing. Letting your mind relax into it and give in to the cloud is not helping. I find that if I start pitying myself and thinking things like &amp;quot;oh why can&amp;#39;t anything ever just go right in my life&amp;quot;, I sink even further down, and that&amp;#39;s obviously not helping anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Reach out to someone, if you can&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This one can be particularly hard for me sometimes. I don&amp;#39;t have (and have never really had) a good close relationship or any kind of connection with my family. They also live in a different country, which I don&amp;#39;t ever intend to go back to. At this point in my life, I have no partner and about two or three really close friends who I love and can candidly talk to about my issues, but as any adults, they all also have their own lives, problems and families, so I can&amp;#39;t expect them to be there every single time I have a crisis. Unfortunately (or luckily?) I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of experience having to deal with difficult things completely on my own, as so many of us have to. I believe that, in many ways, that loneliness has made me more resilient, but when you&amp;#39;re feeling down that same loneliness can sometimes also really kick your ass. So if you&amp;#39;re lucky enough to have a good supportive social circle, let them know how you&amp;#39;re feeling, try to open up, or even just invite someone over for a cuppa or go for a walk together. Simply not being alone (and lonely) the majority of the time can already help minimize/manage feelings of isolation and disassociation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Don&amp;#39;t forget your hobbies and things that bring you joy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Anxiety often overclouds your life, giving you tunnel vision. For me, whenever I get a particularly heavy anxiety attack, I obsessively (and involuntarily) focus on that one thing that&amp;#39;s driving me mad, and everything else kinda becomes muted and greyed out. Or so it seems - but it actually isn&amp;#39;t. The things you like to do, or used to like to do, might seem really trivial and small at the time but they&amp;#39;re not. There is still joy to experience and fun to have. Whatever it is that you might&amp;#39;ve loved before or have always wanted to try - do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Exercise and go outside&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This part can probably be found in every single mental health-related guideline/book/post. And no, it won&amp;#39;t make it all better. Going to the gym or for a walk won&amp;#39;t magically cure all your ailments. But it&amp;#39;s about taking care of the basic needs of your body (which the mind is a part of). You need nutrition, you need sunlight, you need movement, you need other people. So many things that are already bad can become so much worse if those basics are neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Get educated on it and do your own research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You are unique. Your situation is unique. Your mind is unique. Your childhood, your upbringing and your circumstances are unique. Your triggers are unique. There is no &amp;quot;one size fits all&amp;quot; remedy for your particular mental health struggles, so I would encourage anyone and everyone to educate themselves about their condition(s), get information from reliable resources, try out different strategies for managing whatever is bothering you, and basically get to know yourself better by doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Don&amp;#39;t rely on food/drugs/alcohol/shopping or other addictive substances and behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Short-term fixes feel great, but they can breed further disfunction. We all long for that serotonin/dopamine kick, especially when we&amp;#39;re not doing well. But deep down I bet you know that burger won&amp;#39;t make you feel better, that high will be followed by a crash, and that fancy bag will just collect dust in your closet. It&amp;#39;s like putting a bandaid on an infected would - you won&amp;#39;t have to look at how gross it is anymore, but the infection underneath won&amp;#39;t heal.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Sleep is underrated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This one kinda goes hand in hand with #4. Studies after studies have shown that sleep-deprived people are at much higher risk for developing various mental health issues in the long run. Feeling fatigued and constantly tired can also make you more vulnerable and emotional. I sometimes have nights where I need 3-4 hours (and a sleeping pill) to finally fall asleep, and it makes me absolutely miserable. I&amp;#39;ve also found that I have the most trouble falling asleep after a mentally exhausting day, which feels extremely unfair - I&amp;#39;m beat, but my body doesn&amp;#39;t get the message. In those cases, listening to some music can sometimes be a good alternative to medication, which I always try to avoid taking if I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Keep your mind and body busy with good things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Aka &amp;quot;good distractions&amp;quot;. Basically it&amp;#39;s about getting yourself out of your mind. I find that even simple chores, like wiping down the kitchen counters or finally folding my laundry after a week is a much more productive use of my time than sitting on the couch while my brain is on fire once again. It also kind of breaks apart that haze I often get stuck in, where I&amp;#39;m sitting on the couch literally motionless, mentally listing everything that&amp;#39;s wrong with my life, wondering why do I have to feel so miserable all the time. Well, I don&amp;#39;t. I do have (some) power over it. My choices matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. A clean, clutter-free environment can help declutter the mind as well&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This is something that&amp;#39;s big for me - I absolutely hate living in a messy/cluttered place. It makes me feel like there&amp;#39;s something weighing down on my mind. I often purge my closet of things I haven&amp;#39;t worn in a long time, or go through all my drawers clearing out useless junk. I&amp;#39;m not the biggest fan of cleaning, but I often feel a lot better after I&amp;#39;ve finally gotten off the couch and cleaned something. Living alone with two cats also kind of forces me to be organized, because nobody else is gonna do it for me and the cats have to be taken care of. But like so many others, I often struggle with motivation, or have to literally force myself to take out the trash or vacuum. Basic stuff like this can be really hard when you&amp;#39;re in a pit. But letting it become worse and worse can, in turn, exacerbate your mental and emotional unwellness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Journaling &amp;amp; practicing gratitude&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I suck at this, but it is so important. Journalling basically lets you dump out and quiet down all the bees that have been humming non-stop inside your brain, gratitude shifts your perspective on things. It might seem silly to get excited about something as small and (in the grand scheme of things) unimportant as a delicious morning coffee for example, but it&amp;#39;s all about reminding yourself that life isn&amp;#39;t all just pain and agony - there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; still good things in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Meditation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It took me a while to really understand it, and I definitely still wouldn&amp;#39;t call myself a master of meditation. I also don&amp;#39;t do it often enough. But I&amp;#39;ve learned how powerful it can be, and how important grounding and mindfulness is for literally every aspect of life. What worked best for me was an app called Calm - it offers an extensive catalogue of guided (great for beginners) and non-guided meditations, as well as soundscapes, music, sleep stories, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Appropriate and healthy nutrition is key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Same point as in #4 and #7, really. By &amp;quot;appropriate&amp;quot; nutrition I mean whatever is right for you. You might have a very sensitive stomach like myself, so even eating something healthy like a salad can sometimes cause trouble. Or you might have food intolerances, allergies, or other underlying conditions, so your appropriate nutrition might be very different from mine. However, I think we can all pretty much agree on what&amp;#39;s healthy and what isn&amp;#39;t. Food is one of the few things in life that you can absolutely control, and helping your body out in such important aspects as supporting the immune system, digestion and muscle strength can and will help your mind as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. Art (music, literature, design, etc)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I absolutely love cinema, books, music and graphic design. There&amp;#39;s quite a lot of things (like favorite movies/books/songs) that I can pretty much always come back to and rely on when I&amp;#39;m feeling down. Art can be extremely powerful - it can show you that you&amp;#39;re now alone in what you&amp;#39;re feeling, that others have been there too, and managed to overcome their own personal hell. It can also be quite therapeutic to be transported to another world, on paper or on screen, and get a break from your reality when it&amp;#39;s getting you down. Some of the best life lessons I&amp;#39;ve learned literally come from Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. And while some people find it disturbing and loud, I often find comfort in my favorite post-hardcore songs. Somebody once asked me why I like that kind of music, and I said &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;They scream so I don&amp;#39;t have to&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. Try therapy if you can&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t been lucky in this regard (so far), and the therapist I did work with unfortunately didn&amp;#39;t help me at all. Pretty much everything that I&amp;#39;ve found to be helpful for my particular situation I have found on my own. I know that therapy is, sadly, not always available to everyone, either for financial, geographical or other reasons, but I would strongly encourage anyone who&amp;#39;s struggling to try it, in whatever form you have access to - it might even just be an app or a therapist you can text with. Whatever works and feels right for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. Being present &amp;amp; mindful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In a world full of distractions and overstimulation, being present in the moment has become a difficult task that you actively need to practice to remember. Unfortunately, we do so many things without even thinking about it, and a lot of those things are not helpful to us at all. Breaking down that autopilot can help you regain control over your life in many different ways, and become aware of the choices you&amp;#39;re making and how they&amp;#39;re impacting your wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. Refocus your attention from yourself onto others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This one is kind of an echo of #1. When you&amp;#39;re overly (obsessively) focused on yourself and your own issues, they become bigger and bigger in your mind, until there&amp;#39;s no room in there for anything or anyone else, just you and your misery. I find that focusing my attention on others (like my friends, colleagues or my cats) helps me find value in my own existence again. I feel great if I&amp;#39;m able to help someone out or make someone laugh, or see my cats enjoying the snacks I gave them. Humans are inherently selfish creatures, and depression can make it even worse by giving you that tunnel vision. It can be easy to forget that there&amp;#39;s a whole world out there, other people (and animals) that are struggling, people you could help. Whether it&amp;#39;s volunteering or just helping a friend move - you are not useless. You can make a difference, however tiny it may seem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read this all the way to the end - wow, look at you! Thanks!&lt;br/&gt;

,Anxiety,"Hello. I want to start this out saying that i have never been diagnosed with anxiety, but i'm starting to feel like i might be suffering from symptoms. I am not looking for a diagnosis, but a little bit of guidance.

I had a pretty tough childhood, lots of domestic abuse and bullying. Talking with my former therapist i realized that it might have had a pretty big impact on the way i deal with all sorts of relationships. I'm afraid of confrontation, i always push people away when they get too close to me, i have avoidant attachment, and i could keep on going with the list of things that are wrong with me. 

I lost so, so many good friendships and relationships because of this, and lately, the guilt has been consuming me. It doesn't help that i have insomnia. I can't sleep, i get random panic attacks and i feel like i'm a terrible person. I've never been the type of person to cry, but lately i can't help it. 

I recently lost one of my closest friends because i kept pushing her away, and the whole situation has been extremely hard to deal with. We both made mistakes, but i feel like i'm the only one who deserves a ""punishment"". Thinking about confronting her makes my mind go foggy, and i start shaking and getting nervous. I feel like i'm the worst person that exists, and i wish i could be brave and ""not like this"". I wish i could be ANYONE but me.

The guilt consumes every single bit of my brain, and i just can't keep on living like this. I sometimes cry myself to sleep, thinking about every time that i've hurt someone that i loved. I wish i could just start over again, but i know that is not possible. Every time that i try to calm myself down i feel like i'm looking for excuses to not feel bad about the horrible things i've done, almost as if i were manipulating myself. My brain goes ""yes, you can try to find excuses, but you STILL did this. and you cannot escape it."" 

Does anyone have any advice on how to confront my mistakes in a logical way?

And could it be that i'm suffering from anxiety symptoms?

,Anxiety,"I've had anxiety for little over a year with an array of symptoms that have come and gone. The past two weeks have been really stressful and I've felt very overwhelmed but have been coping. I decided to go for a run and about 15 minutes in my feet started to feel warm and fuzzy and almost numb? I thought it must have been to do with the exercise but it hadn't happened when I was running a couple of weeks ago. It lasted about 20 mins then when I got home I didn't notice it again. I went to work yesterday in the office which is loud and bright (this makes me feel pretty anxious anyway) but my hands and feet started to feel strange, fuzzy and slightly numb again. This made me almost panic so I decided to go home and it resolved shortly after. 

I'm sure it's just anxiety as I've had so many odd symptoms the past year that I couldn't believe were solely anxiety related but all tests within last year have come back normal. 

Does anyone else experience this and have any tips? Realistically I can't leave work every single time this happens but I worry it will turn into a panic attack if I don't!

,Anxiety,"hi everyone, i wanted to make this post because i feel like ive been going crazy. ive always struggled with anxiety and it used to be worse back in 2019. it comes and goes. well the last time i had it this bad was in 2019, i made my parents take me to the ER bc i thought i was going to have a heart attack, they did ECG tests or whatever theyre called and they told me i was fine, they took my blood and told me i was completely fine and that i was most likely having a panic attack. anyways, from there i would get anxious about this but not as much. well these past few days have been absolute hell, ive been so anxious since about saturday. On sunday i started to have a weird feeling on the right side of my chest when i woke up and my boyfriend told me it was probably a muscle strain which made sense because i usually sleep on my right side with my right arm extended under my pillow, monday came and i still felt it but it felt more tight and could feel it on my back too, at this point i started to freak out. also idk if this has anything to do with it but i do be smoking, i have a pen so i will hit that bc usually it helps me sleep at night so i started to think it was that i mean it could be. On tuesday, i felt fine felt normal a little tightness but the feeling on my right side chest went away, then this morning IDK if i stretched to hard when i woke up but the left side of my chest felt weird, so i started to freak out again and started to think my arm was hurting. well when i got to work i started to have the worst anxiety i was just in my head the whole time and i couldnt stop thinking about if i was going to die, also google doesnt help i literally search up every little thing and it just makes it worse, literally terrified. i feel a little better now but still seeking reassurance.

,Anxiety,"OK so I've noticed over the past few weeks that my anxiety flares when I need the bathroom, and that sometimes the sensation if relieving myself triggers anxiety, too (I've also been reassured that this was how my mother experienced her anxiety too). Sometimes I've been so nervous I've ended up taking one of my cats in for company / comfort when I'm going. It's ok-ish when I just need to pee, but when it's 💩? I get so nervous beforehand &amp;/or during it, even though it's not anything severe / sickness-y or even close to it. I don't usually have stomach issues, so this is all pretty new to me (the last time I felt like this to the point I was taking my cat/s to the bathroom with me was when I first experienced anxiety &amp; emetophobia, back in 2020-2021). If I know I need to 💩 now, I get so nervous I'll be panicking about it for at *least* 10 minutes before psyching myself up to go, because I know the anxiety will fade afterwards, but the process / sensation of it is... almost nausea-inducing? Like as if using my stomach muscles to do that makes my brain think it's coming up instead of down? I don't really know how else to explain it.


Does anyone else get this??? 


(My anxiety is at a peak this week because my father may have brought a cold home, and last time he brought something home around this time last year, It Happened. I know it's probably just a cold this time, but still.)

My anxiety was pretty low today until I started needing the bathroom.

,Anxiety,"I notice every little thing in my body and the stress &amp; anxiety levels are unbearable. I just want to feel normal again. I just want to feel normal again. But I feel like something is off with my mind and my body and i don’t know what it is.
Have you ever just felt so hopeless? Hopeless is the best way I can put it.

At the beginning of last year I was full of hope and joy, then things shifted somewhere around the end of that year. I began to feel constant brain fog that wouldn’t go away, my memory was getting worse, and my anxiety levels were through the roof. I have no idea what happened. All I know is it happened right after I took antibiotics for an ear infection. 

I went in for an MRI and it came back crystal clear so nothing was seriously wrong in a physical way but what happened psychologically? 

Maybe it has nothing to do with that but regardless of whatever happened or is happening right now I just want to be normal again. No more crippling anxiety, migraines, weird vision changes, and weakness. 
I am a healthy person. I don’t eat as much as I should but when I do eat I make sure it’s healthy. So what is causing this? 

And I’m so scared to stop worrying about my health for a second because I wonder “what if I stop worrying about my health and then my worst health fears come true?”

,Anxiety,"I understand there's a lot of stigma surrounding benzodiazepines, and I've mentioned this several times before. But here's the truth, some of us genuinely need them, just like others require insulin or beta blockers for conditions like high blood pressure.

If you're like me and have tried everything, therapy, supplements, lifestyle adjustments, for years and are still trapped in your room by debilitating anxiety, stop waiting. Seek out medication and start living your life right now, today!

Your time is now! You deserve to live in the moment.

Would you rather spend the next 20, 40, or more years bedridden just because most people are against medication?

It's strange, people accept smoking weed or drinking alcohol in excess, but the moment you take a benzo, it's considered wrong. That's unfair!

Like benzos, weed and alcohol have long-term effects. Everything does! Even the water you drink and the air you breathe contain harmful substances.

If you're constantly worrying about what will happen in 20 or 40 years, you may never truly enjoy your life.

In my family, my mom and several others have been on benzos and SSRIs for 40+ years, and they’re in their 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s now, completely healthy because they've never abused them.

If you need benzos every day to live a fulfilling life, go for it! Just be mindful not to misuse them.

If SSRIs are what you need, take them. Life is unpredictable, you might have a few years or several decades left, so why waste time feeling nauseous, overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts, and depressed, stuck at home?

You can live a normal life, get a job, or pursue an education. Do whatever it takes to feel better, without worrying about what others think, and focus solely on the present.

I hope everyone reading this feels better soon, just like I have since accepting that I need medication. I’m not concerned about side effects that may or may not show up in 30 or 40 years. I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

For now, I'm choosing to live my life fully, happy and functional, rather than spend decades in isolation, suffering, just because society stigmatizes medication.",t2_8fsik00v,False,,0,False,Don't be afraid to take medication if you need it.

,Anxiety,"I had my regularly scheduled therapy today. I really love my therapist. They've gotten me through a lot. I trust them immensely.

Today I was talking about my really severe anxiety lately. It's been the same for the last 3 or 4 sessions. It's situational anxiety but I don't expect it's going away soon. It's taking a lot out of me. I even went home sick today because my body feels like it's sick with a cold all week, even though I don't seem to have a cold.

i have posted a school music video my senior year on this youtube account before so my old friends and parents might see any new videos i post

it's going to be so awkward. how do i stop myself from thinking about what others feel so much?

i keep trying to think to myself they wont care because we wouldn't even be seeing each other anyway but still it's holding me back so much

im so stupid

i am so good at editing, ideas, transitions, good angles, cinematic angles, but i never really put it to use

and then there's the other side of me that thinks im a new youtuber, how would i get any views anyway. they probably wouldn't even be able to see my suggested videos

how do i overcome the fact that my friends and family might be watching my videos?

&lt;p&gt;im a freshman commuting to college&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i have posted a school music video my senior year on this youtube account before so my old friends and parents might see any new videos i post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im so embarassed if i start making and posting any vlogs, my old friends i dont even see anymore are gonna be calling me stupid and cringe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s going to be so awkward. how do i stop myself from thinking about what others feel so much?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i keep trying to think to myself they wont care because we wouldn&amp;#39;t even be seeing each other anyway but still it&amp;#39;s holding me back so much&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im so stupid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am so good at editing, ideas, transitions, good angles, cinematic angles, but i never really put it to use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then there&amp;#39;s the other side of me that thinks im a new youtuber, how would i get any views anyway. they probably wouldn&amp;#39;t even be able to see my suggested videos&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;how do i overcome the fact that my friends and family might be watching my videos?&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Summer of 2022, May. I’m at EDC Las Vegas (EDM festival). It’s day 3 (aka last day), 5am. Festival just ended, on my way to the airport for my early morning flight back to Canada. I’m still high on party favours from the week-end, tired. I want my bed really bad. In all my wisdom, I get a triple iced latte at the airport before boarding my flight. The second the plane lifts up from the runway, my heart starts going cra-zy. Palpitations, super high heart rate, sweating — all alone because my friends live in LA. In my head, all the worse case scenarios: I’m having a heart attack, I’m dying, they’re gonna have to divert the plane and I’m gonna make the headline of some Montreal newspaper as the junky who took to many pills at a party. I land in Montreal, nothing anymore. I managed to sleep on the flight (still don’t know how). Mom picks me up from the airport and I go home to sleep.

Fast forward 2 days: it’s midnight, I’m about to fall asleep and I get this alert on my Apple Watch that my heart rate is high. I get up feeling dizzy with my heart going at 180. I rush upstairs to my mom (she’s a doctor). She takes my heart rate and blood pressure. This “episode” lasted a minute but felt like an hour. I slept with her that night and that’s about it. The next morning, I explain to her what happened on the plane and tell her about the party favours. She didn’t seem worried at all but suggested I see my doctor just in case. 

Week later, I see my doctor. She sends me to see a cardiologist who does an ECG, echocardiography, and the treadmill test. All good, except that one thing on my ECG. Cardio diagnoses me with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. I need to get a small surgery to burn an extra nerve in my heart that makes it have palpitations. So he sends me to a cardiac surgeon

It’s now July 2022. Met the surgeon, old guy. But he knows his shit. He was in the journal for his work and won awards. I’m happy about that. He does another ECG and echocardiography. We go over the results, he sees the same thing on my ECG, but doesn’t agree with the diagnosis. He says he’s not worried at all, and that I’m not at risk for anything. He then makes me sign a paper to get the other hospital to send over the test results the cardiologist had me take.

Fast forward 3 weeks. I’m leaving for Electric Zoo NYC in a few days. I’m driving and I get a call from him. He says he got the results, and now he thinks I need the surgery. Now I can’t get travel insurance, so I have to cancel my plans. He puts me on the waiting list for the surgery. I got the call in November that they were going to do it a week from there.

I get to the hospital with my boyfriend. I’m only there for a day, I’m going home once it’s done. They put the IV in, shave my entire body, and wheel me to the OR. The surgery itself is minor, they go through the arteries in your groin. I honestly didn’t feel much. As they are navigating my heart, they try and stimulate different parts of it to see where the extra nerve is to burn it. But after 2h, they come to the conclusion that I don’t have one, and that my heart is super healthy. They wheel me back to my room, had me stay there for a few hours just in case, and send me on my merry way home.

I honestly don’t remember how I felt back then, but ever since that day, I’ve had crippling anxiety about my heart. I’m always scared that my heart is going to stop without any warnings. There isn’t a day, or even an hour I don’t think about it. My doctor diagnosed me with GAD, we tried a few SSRIs at different doses and nothing worked. I only had side effects. I gained a ton of weight, I couldn’t get my downstairs part to work, I felt numb to happiness. It’s now October 2024. I don’t take any medications anymore, apart from the occasional Ativan when I get a bad panic attack. I went to the ER a few times because I thought I was dying. My life has been hell ever since that back and forth with the diagnosis. You have something, nah you don’t have anything, nevermind we want to operate, ahhhh fuck it it’s good you’re healthy.

I don’t know where to go from there. My life has been a nightmare since. I’m anxious about my heart 24h a day. I still have palpitations, sometimes get scared that my heart will stop out of nowhere. I don’t take party favours anymore, I stopped drinking coffee. I vape tho.

That being said, I still live my life. I go out, I travel, work and go to school. If I didn’t tell you, you would never know. But deep down, it’s always there. That intense fear that my heart is in fact not fine. But I know it is, that’s the thing. It’s been almost 2 years now since the surgeon that literally explored my heart told me I was fine. But the anxiety is telling me it’s not.  This thing is powerfully terrible.

My parents have been divorced since I was young, and while my mom accepts my sexuality, my dad doesn’t. I’ve tried different therapies, SSRIs, SNRIs, and talked to a psychologist.

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone 🙂 As someone relatively new to Reddit and this community, I'm finding it quite enjoyable. Unlike my typical avoidance of social media, Reddit has captured my interest, especially the shared experiences of overcoming anxiety, a condition I've only recently begun to encounter, despite never having struggled with it before but lately it’s hit me like a train. Is there such thing as Medical anxiety? 


My family are telling me that’s what I'm facing, in my head it feels that way, but I'm afraid of complications due to my 2016 diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot requiring lifelong blood thinners. Though not as severe as others' experiences, it was life-altering for me. However, during 2019-2020, while visiting cousins in Europe, I was careless with my medication, thinking I'd overcome my condition , I was 19 years partying and living life it never crossed my mind to take my pills everyday it was a once in a while thing but things changed after a few months returning to Canada, I had weakness and pain throughout my whole body and just a gut feeling something is wrong which lead me to seek help, the E.R revealed recurrent blood clots in my lungs and leg, setting me back to square one. Doctors told me it a miracle since the  blood clots avoided my brain. Hearing the low survival odds from my primary doc left me speechless I knew I had to change and start taking it seriously which I did.  

Fast-forward to 2024, everything's going smoothly, living life day by day, but one day I had a sharp pain in my chest and back, and my leg was swollen, it was very similar to what I experienced before. So, what did I do? I went on Google and spent the whole night searching for why I was getting these symptoms. Google said the number one thing was blockages and blood clots. I was scared the medication wasn't working (Warfarin), but knew it was good and rare for new clots to form while on it, about 3%. In my head, I thought I was that 1% chance, so I went to the ER, told them everything and they did an X-ray, D-Dimer test and said everything's okay, go home, so that's what I did. Things got better, so I forgot about it after a few months, but the same pain returned, worse than before. I called my family doctor, and they ran multiple tests, saying everything was fine, except for blood in my urine, so I saw a specialist. The specialist said I'm fine, 24 and should worry less and live life, which was good news. Now, I'm writing this because I'm experiencing the same pain, a swollen leg and body pain, brain fog. My family says it's medical stress and I should snap out of it which I’m trying too.   

My girlfriend suggested seeing a therapist, but In my head I think I need to see a doctor and have 1,000 tests done. For people experiencing anxiety, is it normal to feel weak in the legs, have brain fog throughout the day and trouble breathing? I've recently had panic attacks with these symptoms, thinking it’s a blockage or that I’ll pass out and needing to go to the ER; this has been happening frequently. In my gut I truly feel something is wrong but in my head and heart I feel I’m fine and that I need to snap out of it. I never really had trouble with anxiety so this is all new to me if this what I’m experiencing is truly anxiety I really hope I can get over it. It’s weighing me down a lot where I have to constantly be on the phone with someone and sometimes scared to sleep of not waking up. Anyhow if anyone reads this whole book any help/ suggestions would be much appreciated! ❤️🤝

&lt;p&gt;If anyone is having the same feeling as me or went through the same thing. I am trying to stop cracking my neck. Please give me some advice. Thanks everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I'm posting here because I've noticed a recurring pattern—several people have suggested that what I’m experiencing sounds like anxiety (though I’m not seeking an online diagnosis).



I’m in my mid-30s, generally introverted, but I still enjoy spending time with others. Despite this, I struggle with intense shyness, especially when interacting with people I don’t know well, regardless of gender. I find it hard to maintain eye contact and often feel nervous, expecting the worst in social situations, even though, in reality, nothing bad usually happens.



Public speaking is particularly challenging for me, even though I lead a small team. I’ve experienced physical symptoms such as shaking, leg pain (which I believe comes from tensing up), and clenching my fists.



Another thing I find difficult is hearing people mention my name in public. For example, if I overhear someone across the office saying something like, “Oh, I saw CIRKLON-3 over the weekend,” or “CIRKLON-3 likes that type of music,” it makes me incredibly uncomfortable to the point I want to leave the room.



I’ve tried making changes, such as cutting out caffeine for the last four months (thinking it might contribute to my symptoms) and working on reducing life stress. However, the anxiety still persists. It’s always worse when I’m not well-rested, and I’ve noticed that exhaustion really amplifies it.



There have been times when I’ve struggled a lot, but also periods where I feel happy, confident, and more in control, with the anxiety subsiding. A rough breakup triggered one of the more difficult spirals, but since then, I’ve had both ups and downs.

,Anxiety,"I’ve been having a tough time in my life lately regarding relationships and anxiety and it’s made me realise something. Although in tough times the situation may present itself differently, it always comes down to the same thing that’s plagued me since I was a child.

At school and as a child, I always struggled with change and with making friends. I had friends but I couldn’t cope when the inevitable teenage things happen and friendships grow and change, some friends stay close and others drift apart. A year and a half ago, I moved to a new city for university. I didn’t know anyone but I was determined to overcome my worries about new relationships and soon people at home remarked on how confident and settled I seemed. I think I was trying to reinvent myself - I wanted to be bright and sure of myself and confident and all those things that don’t come naturally to me. I was delighted that I was seemingly succeeding in this and honestly made some great new friends. But something in me always thinks this is too good to be true, and in some cases it was. 

I’m always worrying about the opinions of people around me and what they might think of who I am, or what I do, or how I do it. I thought it was the company I was keeping, but really it’s me. I’ve always had anxiety and while sometimes it’s more manageable than at other times, it’s just always there and I thought it was a problem I had conquered years ago but it’s not. I’m worried it’ll always be there when things seem to be going well. I want to feel fully happy and assured but I’m just not. In my head, almost 8 years on, I feel the exact same way I did when I was 13, and this is not a trait I like in myself.

It really depresses me that inside, I still feel like the same young scared girl who struggled to make friends. I hate the fact that the thing I want most is to be liked and wanted.

,Anxiety,"Hey guys, so a few years back I (32 F) was in this “on again and off again” friendship with a girl who I got really close to. We somehow always ended up having a falling out over something stupid. I knew she had trust issues from her past traumas so I let a lot of things slide and always ended up giving the friendship another chance. 

About three years ago was the final time we had a falling out. She out of the blue texted me and said “I’m good on the friendship” and that she doesn’t trust me and some other hurtful things. It was totally out of left field and she just dropped me. I was left confused and hurt. We had just hung out a couple weeks ago, and I have not done anything to betray or upset her. So when that happened I promised myself that I would never give this girl another chance again. 

About a year later, she reached out to me on social (she found me via a new account I made). She apologized sincerely and I accepted. She let me know she was in therapy and working on herself and that she was sincerely sorry. This was all via text. After that I changed my number and we never spoke again. 

So then around the same time that this friendship ends, I meet this amazing new friend and we have been going strong for a few years now. 

And here’s where the anxiety part kicks in…I have had a few times where if I didn’t hear from her or we haven’t hung out in a while…I think to myself that I did something wrong and she’s mad at me. (Even though nothing happened!!) or even worse, I start imagining her just dropping me. And then she reaches out and we talk on the phone and make plans and everything is totally normal!!! (It was just all in my head)

This is someone I really deeply care about. And I really cared about my “on again off again friend”. Clearly this really affected me more than I thought.

How can I just freaking TRUST and believe that this new friendship is not going to break me like the last one did.

,Anxiety,"I am very aware of the fact that we are still extremely young and that teen relationships usually don’t last due to insufficient maturity, lack of communication, emotional instability, etc….
I’ve always been very cautious of relationships because i have a huge fear of getting into a toxic one and not being able to get out. Me and my boyfriend have known each other for almost a year, but we only started dating two months ago since i asked him out. He made it abundantly clear that he’s interested in me from the beginning but i was so scared of toxic relationships that i waited a long time until i felt we know each other well enough to start dating. Ever sine we got together we have obviously been spending more time with each other than we did as friends and the more time you spend with someone the more you get to know them and all their sides. I have diagnosed anxiety stemming from trauma which lead to an anxious attachment style, he comes from a very stable home and is quite healthy but had a toxic relationship before me where they never communicated with each other and showed little love. He isn’t toxic or anything since it was mostly his ex who was extremely emotionally unavailable and  me being a good communicator and showing him tons of love helps him open up and do the same but obviously he not as expressive as i am. So, i have one main issue. Sometimes my boyfriend will do small things that hurt me or piss me off a little but the problem is I cannot differentiate between when it’s actually a problem and when its my anxiety looking for triggers and issues where there are none. Sometimes he will be a dry Texter in my eyes and i will get extremely scared thinking he doesn’t love me anymore while he didn’t even notice that he was apparently „being dry“. Sometimes he`ll make a small joke like when you tease your partner a bit and ill get really upset. (When i communicate my feelings He reacts very well no worries, even if he doesn’t quite understand why i feel the way that i do he will still listen and try to change regardless.) I’m always very paranoid he doesn’t love me despite him doing everything for me. He’s not very verbal when being affectionate since its hard for him due to the past relationship, but he‘ll write me letters, buy me stuff, always make time for me, do my work for me etc etc to show me he loves me while im very verbal and constantly express my love to him through words. 
Anyways, my main issue is that I can’t differentiate between an anxious reaction and an actual problem. Communication is important but me communicating every issue can be controlling and ruin the relationship. Sometimes the way i react is the issue not what he did but I don’t know which is which. When I don’t communicate i just feel like im letting some negative feelings build up.

Do you have any advice for anxious partners? Or maybe something i could read/watch? I want to be able to separate anxiety from real issue to better my relationship but idk where to start.

I’ve always been very cautious of relationships because i have a huge fear of getting into a toxic one and not being able to get out. Me and my boyfriend have known each other for almost a year, but we only started dating two months ago since i asked him out. He made it abundantly clear that he’s interested in me from the beginning but i was so scared of toxic relationships that i waited a long time until i felt we know each other well enough to start dating. Ever sine we got together we have obviously been spending more time with each other than we did as friends and the more time you spend with someone the more you get to know them and all their sides. I have diagnosed anxiety stemming from trauma which lead to an anxious attachment style, he comes from a very stable home and is quite healthy but had a toxic relationship before me where they never communicated with each other and showed little love. He isn’t toxic or anything since it was mostly his ex who was extremely emotionally unavailable and  me being a good communicator and showing him tons of love helps him open up and do the same but obviously he not as expressive as i am. So, i have one main issue. Sometimes my boyfriend will do small things that hurt me or piss me off a little but the problem is I cannot differentiate between when it’s actually a problem and when its my anxiety looking for triggers and issues where there are none. Sometimes he will be a dry Texter in my eyes and i will get extremely scared thinking he doesn’t love me anymore while he didn’t even notice that he was apparently „being dry“. Sometimes he`ll make a small joke like when you tease your partner a bit and ill get really upset. (When i communicate my feelings He reacts very well no worries, even if he doesn’t quite understand why i feel the way that i do he will still listen and try to change regardless.) I’m always very paranoid he doesn’t love me despite him doing everything for me. He’s not very verbal when being affectionate since its hard for him due to the past relationship, but he‘ll write me letters, buy me stuff, always make time for me, do my work for me etc etc to show me he loves me while im very verbal and constantly express my love to him through words. 
Anyways, my main issue is that I can’t differentiate between an anxious reaction and an actual problem. Communication is important but me communicating every issue can be controlling and ruin the relationship. Sometimes the way i react is the issue not what he did but I don’t know which is which. When I don’t communicate i just feel like im letting some negative feelings build up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any advice for anxious partners? Or maybe something i could read/watch? I want to be able to separate anxiety from real issue to better my relationship but idk where to start.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"hi. i know reddit is not the place for medical advice but i just wanted to ask other people who may have had a similar experience.

is blacking out from a panic attack okay? like, is it something i should bring to a medical/psychiatric professional, or is it something i can recover from on my own. 

obviously the intensity of panic attacks varies for each person, but having severe anxiety &amp; panic disorder i have never passed out from a panic attack before today. 
i've only ever fainted in my life from dehydration, lack of food, and (not a fucking joke) watching terrifier 2. i don’t know if i had a panic attack in the case of the movie one cuz of all the factors there but i do know i was having a spontaneous panic attack today and i blacked out during it for a brief amount of time.

i've been on xanax for a year, i took one today for my panic attack like i'm supposed to so i doubt it's the medicine as it's never negatively affected me before and always worked as intended. I’ve had water and ate today so i'm just confused about this being a normal occurrence in some panic attacks or not.

,Anxiety,"Hi everybody! I’ve been on Bupropion (generic for Wellbutrin) for about 5 weeks now to treat my ADHD (I’m on other ADHD meds as well) and Depression. 

I was on 150mg (the starting dose) for about a month and it worked really well, helped a LOT with my anxiety, and I did get a few motivational boosts, but it didn’t help enough with lack of motivation/my trouble with task initiation. 

So I moved up to 300mg (the dose that works well for most adults) and have been on this dose for about a week. Well, a few nights ago I randomly remembered the inevitability of my own mortality and started spiraling but I was eventually able to fall asleep. Since then I go back and forth between being mostly fine and then accidentally remembering this concept and subsequently absolutely spiraling, not able to breathe, getting dizzy, and being extremely nauseous. 

Is this most likely a side effect of increasing my Wellbutrin dose? If so, will it go away once my body becomes used to the new dose? The few side effects I had on 150mg went away after a few weeks, so I’m hoping the same happens for this new dose. 

Does anybody have any advice to help me stop spiraling? Most advice for anxiety is unhelpful because those are for situations that happen in life where we can try and tell ourselves we’ll be ok no matter what happens but obviously that’s not the case here. 

(Also please do not talk more about this concept because I’m trying to distract myself). 

Also, I know the obvious solution would be to not think about it and I try not to! The problem is that I’ll be fine for some time and be like “Hey I’m so much less anxious than before hooray!

,Anxiety,"I’m going to put a TW here just because there are some mentions that might trigger people eg, sa, ed, suicide. 

Basically for most of my life I’ve had anxiety well assumed anxiety like I left school at 13-14 years old, can barely talk to people in person or on the phone, overthink everything and can’t even hold a conversation. But to be honest I don’t even know what’s wrong with me, there is definitely something wrong with me. Like here’s some examples.

I can’t sleep in my bed if it’s under the blanket I have to sleep on the blanket with another blanket on top because if my bed isn’t made it triggers my anxiety like to the point of meltdown I wanna cry if it isn’t made.

I work in a primary school as a cleaner and sometimes I’ll play games with the students who are teachers kids while they wait for their parents and then randomly in the back of my head it will just be saying stuff like “eww I bet you like kids” and stuff it’s really weird and fucked. (I think I might be a victim of cocsa but whenever I think about it I have a panic attack and whenever I want to tell someone I convince myself that’s not what it was because my 10 year old self was convinced it was a normal fun game that kids play (it wasn’t)) 

This one’s weird but I have to wear socks otherwise I can’t leave my room, but I can’t wear socks to bed otherwise I get really uncomfortable. This might just be a preference but.

Whenever a minor inconvenience happens like example me overhearing my mom and sister talking about me, my first reaction is to end my own life, I’m afraid that I’m going to actually do it one day because it just overwhelms my brain every time anything happens. 
My internal monologue also is always repeating “you should just kill yourself” almost every day if not multiple times a day.

My I guess anxiety convinces me of things that I don’t even agree on, examples; i love my boyfriend so much, like I wanna marry the guy but every couple of hours my brain is like “you don’t actually love him, you’re gonna hurt him” and stuff like telling myself that I actually don’t have any feelings for him and that I’m just convincing myself I do which isn’t true because I really fucking like him. Another example would be things like tattoos and piercings, I feel instant regret even if it’s a tattoo I’ve wanted and thought on for years my mind is instantly like “that was stupid and now you have it forever you dumb bitch” 

I also think I might have some form of eating disorder but I also tell myself I shouldn’t tell anyone about that either because it’s not “bad enough” to seek help. But I overthink every bit of food I eat and when I’m around people I avoid eating all together, I don’t care if they eat but it makes me feel sick to even think about eating in front of people. 

My deodorants and body sprays have to be in order from tallest to smallest otherwise I don’t have them sit on my desk at all. 

I also have like semi severe fear of germs aswell. And go thru cycles of either showering everyday if not twice to not showering at all. And same for washing my hands, I’ll either wash them with soap twice after using the bathroom or not at all (which is gross I know) 

Can anyone help me ",t2_179go4f3n0,False,,0,False,I don’t know what’s wrong with me. ,[],r/Anxiety,False,,healthflair,0,,,False,t3_1gamr08,False,light,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Health,False,0,,False,False,nsfw,False,,[],{},,True,,1729721067.0,text,,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to put a TW here just because there are some mentions that might trigger people eg, sa, ed, suicide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in a primary school as a cleaner and sometimes I’ll play games with the students who are teachers kids while they wait for their parents and then randomly in the back of my head it will just be saying stuff like “eww I bet you like kids” and stuff it’s really weird and fucked. (I think I might be a victim of cocsa but whenever I think about it I have a panic attack and whenever I want to tell someone I convince myself that’s not what it was because my 10 year old self was convinced it was a normal fun game that kids play (it wasn’t)) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one’s weird but I have to wear socks otherwise I can’t leave my room, but I can’t wear socks to bed otherwise I get really uncomfortable. This might just be a preference but.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever a minor inconvenience happens like example me overhearing my mom and sister talking about me, my first reaction is to end my own life, I’m afraid that I’m going to actually do it one day because it just overwhelms my brain every time anything happens. 
My internal monologue also is always repeating “you should just kill yourself” almost every day if not multiple times a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My I guess anxiety convinces me of things that I don’t even agree on, examples; i love my boyfriend so much, like I wanna marry the guy but every couple of hours my brain is like “you don’t actually love him, you’re gonna hurt him” and stuff like telling myself that I actually don’t have any feelings for him and that I’m just convincing myself I do which isn’t true because I really fucking like him. Another example would be things like tattoos and piercings, I feel instant regret even if it’s a tattoo I’ve wanted and thought on for years my mind is instantly like “that was stupid and now you have it forever you dumb bitch” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think I might have some form of eating disorder but I also tell myself I shouldn’t tell anyone about that either because it’s not “bad enough” to seek help. But I overthink every bit of food I eat and when I’m around people I avoid eating all together, I don’t care if they eat but it makes me feel sick to even think about eating in front of people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My deodorants and body sprays have to be in order from tallest to smallest otherwise I don’t have them sit on my desk at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have like semi severe fear of germs aswell. And go thru cycles of either showering everyday if not twice to not showering at all. And same for washing my hands, I’ll either wash them with soap twice after using the bathroom or not at all (which is gross I know) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone help me &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Yesterday at 1:30pm, I felt like I couldn’t breathe, I immediately sat up and gasped for air. My heart rate shot to 210 and it fluctuated from 170-110 for the remainder of my attack, with brief periods of relief before another wave hit me. This lasted until 3pm. I must have roughly had 7-8 events. Sitting and laying down seems to be triggering these feelings for some odd reason. Standing up and pacing is the only thing that helps even if I feel like I’m about to faint. 
Again at 5:30 had a quick event but wasn’t as severe, luckily i was exhausted and fell asleep until 9:00pm. Woke up feeling super out of it, just confused and didn’t want to talk.

,Anxiety,"Not sure if this is even relevant, but I’m 15. Three weeks ago I started Buspar. I believe it was around 5-7.5 mg twice daily. At first, everything was fine. One thing I should mention is that I had forgotten to take the Buspar twice daily until two weeks ago today when I took one in the morning, and one in the afternoon when I was having an anxiety attack. Pretty quickly I felt twitchy and my limbs just felt heavy. I had no motivation to move and pretty much just sat staring into space until I mustered up enough energy to get up. Then, I realized that my legs were stiff and felt weak. In fact, all my muscles felt weak. At this point, my head and right hand were twitching pretty rapidly. I also couldn’t really walk. I was more so shuffling around the house rather than walking. After 2 hours of just laying down and waiting for the twitching and muscle weakness to stop, the twitching finally ended. However, I still felt extremely weak. The next day, I took one Buspar in the morning (I know, I shouldn’t have) and felt weak again. The twitching didn’t start again until I got up from my bed and started shuffling over to my kitchen. My mom was immediately concerned because my head was literally bobbing up and down at this point. She tried holding my head still, but the head nodding just got worse. Ended up going into urgent care, but they told my mom and I that we needed to go to the ER since they didn’t have the appropriate testing equipment. When I got to the ER, they took my vitals and gave me an EKG, then sent me out into a waiting room full of people. Turns out the wait time was 6 HOURS, but we didn’t know that until we told the receptionist we were leaving. While in the waiting room, my head nodding only got worse, which also worsened the pain in my shoulders and neck. That day, my head nodded up and down continuously for 3 hours until it magically stopped when I was laughing at something. If I had to guess, I think maybe the head nodding was real at first, but then maybe I just continued to nod my head even when the medication wore off because I was so used to doing it? Does that make sense? I’m pretty disappointed I can’t continue the Buspar, since it’s  the only anti anxiety med that I’m aware of that doesn’t cause drowsiness.

Then, I realized that my legs were stiff and felt weak. In fact, all my muscles felt weak. At this point, my head and right hand were twitching pretty rapidly. I also couldn’t really walk. I was more so shuffling around the house rather than walking. After 2 hours of just laying down and waiting for the twitching and muscle weakness to stop, the twitching finally ended. However, I still felt extremely weak. The next day, I took one Buspar in the morning (I know, I shouldn’t have) and felt weak again. The twitching didn’t start again until I got up from my bed and started shuffling over to my kitchen. My mom was immediately concerned because my head was literally bobbing up and down at this point. She tried holding my head still, but the head nodding just got worse. Ended up going into urgent care, but they told my mom and I that we needed to go to the ER since they didn’t have the appropriate testing equipment. When I got to the ER, they took my vitals and gave me an EKG, then sent me out into a waiting room full of people. Turns out the wait time was 6 HOURS, but we didn’t know that until we told the receptionist we were leaving. While in the waiting room, my head nodding only got worse, which also worsened the pain in my shoulders and neck. That day, my head nodded up and down continuously for 3 hours until it magically stopped when I was laughing at something. If I had to guess, I think maybe the head nodding was real at first, but then maybe I just continued to nod my head even when the medication wore off because I was so used to doing it? Does that make sense? I’m pretty disappointed I can’t continue the Buspar, since it’s  the only anti anxiety med that I’m aware of that doesn’t cause drowsiness. Anyways, did anything similar happen to anyone else? This has been weighing on me for the past two weeks since it happened, and I’m curious how many people had similar reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Hi there, glad you are here.

I'm a person who has suffered from anxiety in every way possible since as long as I can remember, I'm currently 31 years old and have been anxiety free for months now and I attribute it completely to the very easily triggering word acceptance.

I've always had a burning passion for helping people and psychology so I figured I would reach out to anyone who sees this and offer my support in truly understanding acceptance and help with troubleshooting whatever pitfalls you may get stuck in.

Now you're surely thinking ""What's the catch?"", well the catch is that I want to see if I truly enjoy helping random people as much as I think I do.

If you are willing to give me a chance to help you, please send me a message and I will do my absolute best to help you get to the place I have arrived, it is lovely here.

,Anxiety,"First post here so a quick bit of backstory. I'm in my very early forties and have dealt with anxiety, depression, anger and attention issues all of my life. Saw some therapists when I was in my twenties but nothing really took. I finally decided to try to talk to someone again because things have been incredibly hard and just getting worse day by day for a while now. So I joined talkiatry and was matched with a psychiatrist.

I’ve only had one session with him, but I feel like he’s not really invested in my care and getting the impression I'm just another number. 

In the first session, he just gave me a questionnaire I had already filled out, diagnosed me based on that, and prescribed Zoloft. I reached out last week about switching meds because I wasn't feeling good on it, and his only reply was essentially, 'We can talk about it next session.' Is this kind of approach normal?

,Anxiety,"Okay so basically in August i went out with  of my closest friends and it went bad real fast. 

To explain, i'm 27F and from my 12yo to my 19yo i went trough depression, huge panic attacks and dissociation. Developped severe agoraphobia. Treated with medicine since then. For 7 years it was good. 

In April i went to Barcelona (i'm french) and I couldn't stay more than one day because i went into a huge and vicious panic attack that lasted hours and hours. Went back home in France.  
Then, first week of august i was supposed to go to Italy. I was so stressed out because of what happened in Barcelona that i didn't go. Two weeks later, I met with my two friends in august at a bar. 

Went into an even bigger panic attack with a feeling of impending doom, it lasted so long until the day after that i ended up at the psychatrist emergencies and stayed there for 4 days. 

Since then, it's an everyday stress. Some days are okay, some are good, some are complicated especially after going out by myself. I'm seeing two different therapist that actually help me, but it's too soon to actually see big improvments. Just little improvments. Going out alone, not taking xanax to help soothe the crisis, meditating, rationalzing... But i'm so scared that i have to go to the hospital again. 

Tomorrow night, i'm seeing these two friends again outside. Socializing in real life is asking me a lot of efforts lately. Still I force myself cause i don't want to sink down any rabbit hole. But yet, this fear of impending doom that i felt in august stays in the back of my head. 

I'm scared it will happen again tomorrow night. But also, I have to do it. If i don't, i'll sink down the rabbit hole like i did 10 years ago. It lasted so for years. I don't want to live that again, cause now i have the experience, the maturity and everything that comes with it. But yet, i feel helpless when going though a panic attack. I'm scared it will last.

In April i went to Barcelona (i'm french) and I couldn't stay more than one day because i went into a huge and vicious panic attack that lasted hours and hours. Went back home in France.  
Then, first week of august i was supposed to go to Italy. I was so stressed out because of what happened in Barcelona that i didn't go. Two weeks later, I met with my two friends in august at a bar. 

Went into an even bigger panic attack with a feeling of impending doom, it lasted so long until the day after that i ended up at the psychatrist emergencies and stayed there for 4 days. 

Since then, it's an everyday stress. Some days are okay, some are good, some are complicated especially after going out by myself. I'm seeing two different therapist that actually help me, but it's too soon to actually see big improvments. Just little improvments. Going out alone, not taking xanax to help soothe the crisis, meditating, rationalzing... But i'm so scared that i have to go to the hospital again. 

Tomorrow night, i'm seeing these two friends again outside. Socializing in real life is asking me a lot of efforts lately. Still I force myself cause i don't want to sink down any rabbit hole. But yet, this fear of impending doom that i felt in august stays in the back of my head. 

I'm scared it will happen again tomorrow night. But also, I have to do it. If i don't, i'll sink down the rabbit hole like i did 10 years ago. It lasted so for years. I don't want to live that again, cause now i have the experience, the maturity and everything that comes with it. But yet, i feel helpless when going though a panic attack. I'm scared it will last. 

So, if anyone goes though the same thing... Same fears etc... How do you calm down before meeting friends ? And how to you focus on something else but fear ?

,Anxiety,"Hello, my anxiety warriors!

I had a quick recommendation for a mobile game that has helped me on a few occasions feel less anxious. It contains simple mini games like moving the marbles around, fidget spinner, etc. but it’s got a tactical feel to it, which I think is what helps with anxiety.

Anyway; thought of sharing this in case it helps someone else too :) 

The exact name is “Antistress - relaxing game” and the developer is Moreno Maio.

,Anxiety,"Long story short, I have been seeing this doctor now for about a year.  I ended up lying that I was still drinking alcohol occasionally and now she thinks I am an alcoholic.  I am NOT and I am also NOT in denial.  I had a problem the last few years with using alcohol to cope with how I felt.  It was more binge drinking a 6 pack of beer every 4-5 weeks.  Rarely was it ever sooner then this.  I do not drink hard liquor either.

I explained that I had not been honest and that I have drink maybe once a month or less and now she thinks I am a ""functioning alcoholic"".  She has now put me on Naltrexone to stop cravings although I rarely ever get actual cravings.  It just comes up one day and I'm like ""hey I kind of want a few beers tonight"".

It says to make sure you don't take opioids for at least 10 days before taking medication.  I do take a low dose of Kratom that she doesn't know about.  So now I am worried I shouldn't take this medication at all.

I feel she truly has a label on who I am and doesn't know the real me.  Anyone around me (casual drinkers and some none drinkers) would never say I even have an alcohol problem at all.  I am just really confused on what to do or if I should drop her.  I have made the decision to stop drinking entirely though so I'm at least being honest to her about that.

Am I crazy, in denial or is she being a bit overdramatic?  Maybe all three?

Anyway, I cut off all my friends a few years ago coz I felt like my life isn't improving and it was hard seeing them making it. I graduated later than them coz of some issues and I haven't gotten a job yet.

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone. I \[30F\] have been struggling with an especially severe bout of anxiety recently, such to the point that I haven't been eating or sleeping well. I literally have panic attacks when I wake up in the morning, and I'm essentially non-functional at work.

So, being that this is what you're ""supposed"" to do, I made an urgent appointment with my psychiatrist. My symptoms, including passive SI, were/are so bad that I thought I was gonna get committed.

Because I have addiction issues (alcohol and opiates) from back in 2016 that I stupidly admitted to, they absolutely refuse to give me benzos, even though those are the only PRNs that work for me!

I've tried EVERYTHING else imaginable: Hydroxizine, gabapentin, propanolol, Buspirone... the only thing that's worked before was Klonopin, and they absolutely won't prescribe it to me. It's getting so bad that I'm thinking about getting back on Oxy.

You know what my psychatrist did? Up my Lexapro dosage and tell me to see my therapist more. I left the office literally crying because there's no prospect of relief anymore - I just know I have to suffer through it until it passes naturally.

Can anyone relate?

,Anxiety,"Just a quick rundown, I haven’t been sleeping well lately and have work stress added on top. 

Since Saturday night, I’ve noticed an increase in light sensitivity and eyes feeling strained/dry. 

Last Thursday I was using a piece of equipment in the gym, and the sun was blaring in my face brightly (through two windows, one which is tinted), so I had to my eyes focused directly down, until some clouds went in front of the sun.

Went to the opticians yesterday, eyes had barely changed since last time, they appeared OK, though my right eye is producing less tears, so they’ve given me some drops to use for a few weeks.

&lt;p&gt;Since Saturday night, I’ve noticed an increase in light sensitivity and eyes feeling strained/dry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday I was using a piece of equipment in the gym, and the sun was blaring in my face brightly (through two windows, one which is tinted), so I had to my eyes focused directly down, until some clouds went in front of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went to the opticians yesterday, eyes had barely changed since last time, they appeared OK, though my right eye is producing less tears, so they’ve given me some drops to use for a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"TRIGGER WARNING: MENTIONS OF SUICIDE THOUGHTS.

Hi everyone. Sorry to disrupt in here, but a previous psychologist of mine diagnosed me with anxiety so...

I wanted to talk about academic anxiety. Of course, my anxiety is kinda generalized, but I have a very specific type of anxiety related to academic environments.

Like, I always hated school, all of my 11 years of obligatory education were absolute hell, but things went downhill in college. I started to fail in college after a first year of doing very well, but then I started failing, and spiraling down, and over time the fear of failing made me fail, and then fail even harder. And my mom did it a lot worse. 

I won't tell everything my mom did because I don't want to write a bible, but because I was failing I was screamed almost daily, verbally abused almost daily, guilt-tripped, and told that I would never accomplish anything in life. Some days my mom would scream at me for hours with no end. 

I stopped telling my mom about my grades, and then went out of her way to get them anyway, because she has a friend who was a professor at the university I was at and he told him my grades (not even a professor of my degree).

I didn't want to continue because I failed second year and couldn't bear the shame of coming back after failing. I had fought with my mom a lot about it, and then, she went and sign me up to redo the year behind my back, so I had no option but to do the year again, and I did even worst, because I couldn't focus on anything, I was only thinking about ending myself in class, and then started skipping classes, and even exams. I skipped the most important exams of the year because I was doing so terribly at them.

At some moment in this year, I suggested my mom to sign me up to an online university, and she exploded at me, we had the biggest ugliest fight we ever had. Of course she don't remember any of it, conveniently. 

And I failed again, the university don't allow people who fail the same year twice in a row to sign up again, so I just dropped out and my mom could do nothing about it. 

In the upcoming years I tried changing careers and universities, and my mom never liked any of them, because they were ""lesser"" careers and universities. But always, when the first exam came up, I just froze and failed, and then stopped going to university altogether. It happened at least 3 times. The last one was computer science at an online university, I thought would be easy since I like computers a lot and it was an online university, but it happened again, and I'm frustrated that for the online students they just gives us PDFs and videos while the ones that live in the city the university is located, they can go there and actually talk to professors and have in person studying, so I felt at a disadvantage.

My mom will always say I'm a failure because I didn't finish law school, and I don't think I can go back to an university because of this terrible anxiety. I can't even come into a classroom anymore because I have to deal with the anxiety. 

The thing is, I love learning, I learn a lot everyday and I love reading a lot.

,Anxiety,"Hey everyone,
So I was on Paxil on and off since middle school. It works but when I get triggered by something that reacts to my PTSD then my anxiety comes back and takes awhile to go away. 

Recently I saw a Dr who changed me from paxil to effexor and the last 2 weeks were hell and when I reached out to her she wouldn't listen and eventually I went off and she dumped me. So now I'm off effexor, didn't take it yesterday or today and I feel so different already in a good way. Feel more normal. 

Im currently in a Partial hospitalization program and they said I could take this week off as like a wash out cause I was worried to jump onto a new medicine so quickly.

So my question is, should I go on a medication? If so what is a good medicine? If paxil works at times but I have break through issues is there is something like paxil but better that I should take?

&lt;p&gt;Im currently in a Partial hospitalization program and they said I could take this week off as like a wash out cause I was worried to jump onto a new medicine so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is, should I go on a medication? If so what is a good medicine? If paxil works at times but I have break through issues is there is something like paxil but better that I should take? 
I want to hear your opinions so I can have an idea of different medication I could try since paxil was somewhat working. I have PTSD, Health Anxiety, GAD, and some OCD tendencies. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Hi, im 17 and I'm going through a very weird and hard time. I always used to be very emphatetic and I searched for good in life. I've never belived in God but it didn't bother me - everyday I used to think about how does everything we know works. I loved art, many things seemed beautiful. It all seemed good even though I feel that through all this I didn't like myself. I used to think I can't accept my aperance until someone finds me enough. One year ago I met my boyfriend and until August I was going through the best time of my life. My goal in life is to do as much good as I can.

At least I think it is. For two months I've been going through some kind of revolution in my brain. It started from unwanted exsistentional thoughts and intrustive thoughts suggesting I could do something terrible. I got so scared of the fact that my mind managed to create those ideas that i fell into some kind of anxiety loop - im scared of the fact that im scared. Now my main problem is that sometimes I feel that nothing makes sense. Sometimes i dissconect from it all, like I forget all the things I used to believe in. People seem bad, or more like good is no longer defined in my mind. It's so scary because everytime I find a soultion, a good thought, I still manage to make it absurd and not worth believing.

,Anxiety,"I have been dealing with anxiety for a few months now and it has caused me to change my life completely. I don’t drink coffee anymore, I don’t want to do outings anymore, I don’t find enjoyment in what I used to because I’m worried the anxiety will come up and I’ll associate my hobbies with it. All I seem to do is work and focus on the symptoms of my anxiety or when I’ll have another attack. 

The past two days have been extremely hard for me and I don’t know why. I’ve tried getting into activities again. Some include embroidery, crocheting, going to activities at my church. It just seemed to make me topple over. At least I feel that way. The past two days have brought me nothing but chest pains more than I usually experience. 

Last night I was experiencing the chest pains more frequently and tried to calm myself down. I tried doing all the exercises my counselor has taught me which didn’t work. So, I tried to take a shower to calm myself down. I felt ok in the shower. After that I went to bed and thought I’d lay down and try to relax. I was in bed for about ten minutes when the feeling of impending doom hit me and I could feel a lump in my throat with chest pain coming and going. I instantly jumped up and ran to my husband telling him I didn’t feel good. He tried to do the find the rainbow, box breathing, everything with me but it didn’t work. My heart rate got up to 146 and I started to freak out more. 

Finally, we decided it was best I go to the ER. I got in the car and once we got to the end of the driveway I felt like I was going to pass out or die. I kept begging my husband to drive faster. I rolled my window down and try to breathe while taking in the night air. It helped me calm down a little but my heart was still racing. My husband dropped me off at the front door to the ER because it was crowded. When I walked in I was shaking so bad and crying. The receptionist checked me in and I got triaged to the back. The nurse took my vitals and asked me the intake questions. She performed an EKG in the intake room and said my heart rate was 97 so I was sent back to the waiting room because I wasn’t deemed an emergency anymore. 

I sat in the waiting room with my husband for about an hour until an EMT came to take my blood. This took 30 minutes or longer because I was such a hard stick. I ended up getting the IV at my wrist which scared my husband (later when we were leaving it started pouring blood). Another hour went by and a woman came out and called my name. I stood up and so did my husband but she put her hand in his face and said only her. My husband instantly got worried and I could feel my heart racing. Luckily it was only for an X-ray. Once this was completed I went back into the waiting room. I sat there for another hour until a nurse came and took me to a room. 

When I got into the room he took more blood for the second troponin test and asked me some basic questions and got my vitals which luckily had come back down to normal (HR 76 and BP 106/66). We were in the room for about another hour until the ER doctor came in. He told me that the x-ray, EKG, and bloodwork was absolutely fine but I needed to follow up with my PCP. My troponin never got elevated and he said it was the normal below 2. 

My chest has been so sore since last night and I’m extremely worried about everything. I know this is probably anxiety but I have not had a bad attack like this in two months. It’s like I forgot the feeling of a full blown attack. I’m going to my counselor today and then my doctor right after. I’m hoping I can get a heart monitor or medicine to help. I’ve tried hydroxyzine (as needed), lexapro, and Zoloft but none of them helped. Lexapro gave me extremely bad side effects. Hydroxyzine caused my heart rate to got up. Zoloft caused me to be extremely numb to everything around me. 

Has anyone else had experiences like this? What medications help you? I feel so hopeless and lost. My chest is heavy and feels hollow with spontaneous pains.

,Anxiety,"My wife and I met in graduate school while pursuing our PhDs. I was drawn to her easygoing nature—she was kind, gentle, and fun to be around. I graduated first and landed a job as a professor at an major university, and she moved with me to finish her degree remotely. Soon after, we got married, and this is when things started to feel off. I planned most of the wedding, and she constantly fought with me during the process, which was stressful. At the time, I was self-medicating my anxiety with marijuana, and as I took on more responsibilities in our relationship—handling finances, housing, and big decisions—my anxiety only grew. I just assumed this was how marriage was supposed to be.  
  
After we moved, my wife took on a series of part-time jobs while I worked 60+ hour weeks trying to achieve tenure. I pushed hard to help her advance in her career, even sacrificing some of my own opportunities and raises. I spent years advocating for her, first getting her an adjunct position, then a full-time lecturer role, and finally, a coveted tenure-track job. Meanwhile, we had our first child and bought a house. Despite all this, she still seemed unhappy and unfulfilled.  
  
As our family grew with a second child, the stress in our relationship intensified. I was responsible for most things at home—finances, home renovations, cleaning, half the childcare, etc. Her primary responsibly revolved around grocery shopping, cooking, and the other half of childcare. Whenever I tried to discuss these pressures, she would dismiss them as ""my issues"" to deal with. I continued using marijuana to cope, but eventually, I started therapy and was prescribed anti-anxiety and depression meds. We also began marriage counseling, but the focus was mostly on my faults. It became clear that much of my anxiety stemmed from my wife’s lack of contribution and the constant burden of taking care of everything.  
  
Despite my rising anxiety, I earned tenure and became the graduate coordinator, which gave me more responsibilities at work. Yet, I still directed resources toward her—more than any other colleague—because I thought it was the right thing to do. After I earned tenure, she wanted me to take a back seat and focus more on our kids so she could focus on her career. I agreed, even though my workload had only increased, and the financial strain of daycare ($4K/month) was immense. I started a second business to help with our finances.  
  
Now, I'm juggling two demanding jobs, two young kids, and the bulk of household responsibilities. My wife has become increasingly disengaged from chores and home maintenance, preferring to prioritize social activities whenever possible. When I ask for help with things like yard work or house projects, I’m somehow the bad guy. It feels like I’m taking care of two small children and one adult child. I’m exhausted and overwhelmed.  
  
So, am I wrong for feeling like my wife takes advantage of me and isn’t pulling her weight, or should I just keep quiet, deal with my anxiety, and make it all work?

,Anxiety,"(I live in France)

I've had a few experiences with psychiatrists these last few years. I've seen one for a few months 4 years ago, we talked, she prescribed a variety of anti-depressants over the course of those months and nothing worked. I stopped seeing her but I don't really remember why.

I've seen another one last year regarding my need to adress untreated ADHD. She was an unsufferable greedy cunt so I quickly stopped. I still managed to get a prescription for ADHD medication but I backed down because of how it butchers sleep and hunger, which are the very last things I need.

While searching for a new psychiastrist, I looked at google reviews and they're 90% of the times disastrous. Those people charge 80€+ for barely half an hour, they lack empathy and treat people like shit. Out of 30 profiles, A SINGLE ONE had more than 2,5 out of 5 stars.

My anxiety causes me to always face the void and ruminate about the absurd. I sleep very badly, I wake up with a start multiple times per night with my heart racing while I face the unbearable horror of existence and consciousness for a few seconds in a state of mind that feels like its mental barriers went down for a few seconds.

I feel like there's no answer but medication for my condition so that's why I want to see a psychiastrist.

I recently blew (again) a very rare chance of connexion and intimacy with someone by being incapable of sexualizing my behavior because of anxiety and fear of sexuality and I barely can take it. Now there's this awkwardness between us, I feel humiliated and eternally condemned to despair and failure.

I'll be 30 tomorrow, time is passing and I've know nothing but constant suffering for the last 20 years, I need to find a solution.

So please tell me anything you might have to say about psychiastrists, medication or natural ways to ease anxiety.

,Anxiety,"last night i had one of the worst panic/anxiety attacks i've ever experienced in my entire life. no one has ever witnessed one of my episodes and i recently moved in with my boyfriend.

a little back story--i stopped smoking weed my sophomore year of college and just recently started a year ago (im 26 now)  because i believed i was in a better place in order to do so also it has been recently helping with some of my stresses with school/work. for context, i am going back to school to get another masters and working full time as well as living with him for the first time so my cup is fulleth as they say.

i had smoked and then come back inside to cook and while i was standing over the stove i could feel my heart race increase and my breath becoming shorter and shorter, i ran over to the couch and immediately started the grounding exercises i have learned in therapy. he was such an angel and it just reminded my why i love him so much. he rubbed my back, did breathing exercises with me and reassured me that everything was okay. usually my attacks last a few minutes and then i calm down, but this one came in waves and seemed to last way longer than normal (maybe due to the bad weed). i have never felt the fear of death before while having an anxiety attack, but for the first time yesterday i thought it was the end. i was so scared this morning when i woke up and also so embarrassed :/ my boyfriend has been such a god send honestly he did nothing to make me feel that way, but i cant help but feel like a crazy person because all these years i've hid my anxiety attacks from everyone.

,Anxiety,"Hey guys can you all help me become tougher? I have trouble ruminating on past bad experiences and I want to gain balance in my brain again for the sake of my emotional health. I don't want to be an asshole and snap at people for no reason, but in the event that someone tries to mess with me I want to get an idea of what to do and say.

For context, last year in my junior year of college, I dealt with people at my school being racist and rude when I literally don't know them and have done nothing to them. One time last year I was walking home after hanging out with a friend and a group of white students were walking in my direction and I think one of the girls said “Hiii n1ggaaa” all giggly and she sounded drunk and I was caught off guard so I walked away and ignored them and called my mom. I WOULD'VE said something but at the time I didn't know if she said the word for sure and I didn't want to crash out on them for no reason and cry wolf.

Another time I had lived near these racist guys and one time they sat near me in our cafeteria (the apartment had it's own small cafeteria) and I think one of them said the n word but not to my face it was under his breath and the other guys were giggling about how one of their friends were racist and how “he’s the man”; I got up and ate somewhere else. If you guys are so racist why sit next to me?? And the ppl who worked in the cafeteria were black, too and nice to these students. These guys would yell the word (hard r) in the halls of our apartment too or just say it to their friends and when I'd try to go and report it to the RA they'd try to help but kinda drag their feet and the rude guys would just double down, ugh. I ended up using ear plugs for the rest of the year then left to go live somewhere else. I feel like it was a mistake living there anyway; the only good outcome was meeting my dear roommate and being within walking distance of some cool areas. I didn't confront these residents directly because I was pretty outnumbered and didn't thin i'd have any real backup except for the RAs of the apartment. I also didn't want these people to follow me back to my room and start harassing me while I literally have school and my own life to worry about. In addition, I didn't want to remember their faces when I left that apartment. I'm not used to people using that kind of language, tbh.

tldr: How to I stop sweating the past stuff and become tougher, but not go numb to the nasty things people say?

,Anxiety,"I received two injections of paliperidone (250mg and 150mg), with the last one being 3 months ago.



Here are the symptoms I’ve experienced:

\- Akathisia (lasted for 1 month)

\- Panic disorder (lasted for 1 month)

\- Shortness of breath (was severe for the first month but is improving)

\- Weight gain of 10kg

\- Loss of libido (about 20% recovery after 3 months)

\- Inability to think logically (gradually improving)

\- Difficulty forming sentences (gradually improving)

\- Anxiety about the future (still ongoing)

\- Loss of interest in everything (still ongoing)



It’s been 3 months since the last injection, and I’ve seen significant emotional and functional recovery. However, some issues are still ongoing, so I’m wondering if, after about a year, I can expect to recover almost fully, as some have mentioned.



I used to be a very positive and driven person, but after the paliperidone injections, my personality has completely shifted to being negative and passive. I no longer have interest in anything, and I’m constantly anxious and worried that I won’t be able to do anything.



My biggest concerns are erectile dysfunction, anxiety, and cognitive decline. I’m afraid that these might cause permanent damage. No matter how much stimulation I get, my libido doesn’t return to how it was before, and the persistent anxiety worries me.

I think I received the 3-month injection, and I’ve heard that the effects can last up to 9-12 months after the last dose, and that it takes about that long for the drug to be fully cleared from the system.

&lt;p&gt;Here are the symptoms I’ve experienced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Akathisia (lasted for 1 month)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Panic disorder (lasted for 1 month)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Shortness of breath (was severe for the first month but is improving)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Weight gain of 10kg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Loss of libido (about 20% recovery after 3 months)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Inability to think logically (gradually improving)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Difficulty forming sentences (gradually improving)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Anxiety about the future (still ongoing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Loss of interest in everything (still ongoing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been 3 months since the last injection, and I’ve seen significant emotional and functional recovery. However, some issues are still ongoing, so I’m wondering if, after about a year, I can expect to recover almost fully, as some have mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be a very positive and driven person, but after the paliperidone injections, my personality has completely shifted to being negative and passive. I no longer have interest in anything, and I’m constantly anxious and worried that I won’t be able to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest concerns are erectile dysfunction, anxiety, and cognitive decline. I’m afraid that these might cause permanent damage. No matter how much stimulation I get, my libido doesn’t return to how it was before, and the persistent anxiety worries me. If anyone has recovered from these issues, I’d really appreciate if you could share your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Since I was very young, I've always valued humbleness and self-awareness a lot, and disrespected arrogance. I've always understood that bragging is what people do when they aren't finding that validation inside.

I've also always been very easily disturbed by fiction. Five years ago a fictional show permanently ruined my outlook on life and perception of people. One of the characters was a cold emotionally distant soldier who was later revealed to have once been an innocent and harmless child until a tragic event. At the time it was nothing new to me. Until later when the character simply said 'I am strong' and I perceived the characters as slightly more intimidating but also lost some respect. It took about 6 months for this fictional scene to take over my subconscious and once I realised how I felt I started to feel hopeless. The transformation felt a lot worse than if the character just died. Even though I knew it wasn't real, how could someone change so quickly, so exaggeratedly and how is everyone but me OK with this? I was desperate to know everything about this character, especially the ending. I was desperate for them to return to their harmless compassionate self. The show wasn't finished so all I could do was endlessly theorize when I was on vacation, at college, went to sleep, and woke up.

At some point, I burnt the bridge with the show and never watched anything associated with it again. The source never bothered me again, but the habits I developed have got so much worse. I continued the same routine with multiple fictional characters and soon real people. My life entirely revolves around this fear, it's all I am inside. If I were to summarise it, it's a fear of change specifically in strength. This could be physically, mentally, socially, even financially. Things that I must feel are worth bragging about. Arrogance didn't bother me until that fictional character planted the idea that maybe it didn't come out of nowhere.

My attempts to debunk my own fears that every single person is capable of changing in this direction have instead led me to learn how unpredictably malleable humans are and that I'm safe from no one. I don't care if it is unlikely, if it's possible it's already happened. There is no predicting and that makes me want to hide away until I'm dead. I'm now entirely incapable of making friends, relationships, unconditional love. I don't know who I am to tell people who they shouldn't be which is why I can never tell anyone about this. I'm deeply ashamed of it. It briefly led me to cutting myself but after that one time, I felt like I was able to take control of my feelings a lot more.

Even though it has been a lot better these past few years, and I've gotten the hang of ignoring things that bother me. I feel exactly how I did 5 years ago but with a real person who is pretty much the embodiment of everything I've been trying to deny. So this person became a fitness influencer and is physically stronger and looks different which usually I'd be able to handle if it wasn't for the arrogant and self-admiration persona. I can't tell if it's a played-up persona and because I can't tell, it hasn't left my mind in two weeks. This person also likes to use before and after comparisons to inspire as well as provoke the non-supporters. The worst thing about all this is that it happened in their 40s. 20 years of being a normal adult. They never used to come across that way at all. Either they've always been like this or desired to be, or they literally mentally changed their personality making their old self a victim to their physical transformation, if I can even admit to myself that it's possible. Either way I'm unhappy but the latter is so much worse. I know it's possible to an extent but it makes me want to repeatedly smash my head into a wall.

I don't know why I'm writing this but until now I haven't been able to admit the specifics of my feelings so in a way it's progress.

,Anxiety,"I’m sick and tired of feeling like I’ll never be normal.

I’ve just recently started college and I’ve never felt more out of place. I constantly feel like I exert myself more than other people. I have to work twice as hard just to do regular things, like talk to people, move around, even just standing up to go to my next class or sitting down somewhere in the library makes me feel anxious. I feel like I’m being judged from every angle and I know people don’t care and they’re selfish and in their own world, I just keep feeling anxious regardless.

And then the comparison is starting again. I haven’t made any friends at all in school. But I look around at my classmates and they all already have predetermined groups. They can do things flawlessly and they don’t have to work as hard. They don’t feel restless or anxious at every second thinking about what the person next to them might be thinking about them. On top of that, everyone knows what they’re going to do in the future. I still feel at odds with what I want to do. They just live and exist and I wish I could just be normal like them. 

I’ve gone through a couple of therapists, and I just recently got off my last one two months ago because I was too lazy to want to continue and I thought I was doing pretty well at handling my anxiety. Yet here I am, back in this miserable cycle of comparing myself to others, which happened during my freshman year of high school (during the covid year) and during 7th grade. It feels like I haven’t made any progress at all, or at least that I’ve reversed it all and failed myself. And it feels like I can’t go back to therapy because then I would be considered a failure to myself and to my parents. I didn’t even like my last therapist because I would always lie to her about my progress out of fear of judgment (which makes NO sense because that’s what she’s there for) and yet I did make some progress but now it’s all gone backwards. I feel frustrated with myself and every day is exhausting again.

,Anxiety,"This is my first time going to therapy. Idk if it's the therapy itself that isn't right for me or if my therapist is not connecting to me. Because I feel like when we meet up I always have to do the talking first. He doesn't know what to ask about or what talk about. It feels kind of awkward. As offensive as it may sound, I feel like I'm always leading the conversation and trying to teach him how to be a ""good"" therapist.

I guess my idea of a ""good"" therapist is somebody who talks to you about the difficult things. But whenever WE talk it's always about super awkward or random things. He'll start talking about how his experiences were with certain topics and how he thinks we could do things differently and he kind of dismissed what I told him about my experiences and feelings. (I can go in to detail here if you want).

Being my first time in therapy and all, I can't tell if I'm expecting too much from a therapist or if they're not trying hard enough. Sorry again, I know how arrogant and ignorant this sounds...! I just can't find the correct words!!

I think the reason I say he isn't trying hard enough is because I feel like I wasted two weeks of my life already. We meet once every week and everytime we meet I feel like he doesn't have a plan to help me. It's always just ""So Ben, what do you want to talk about this week?"".

My main goal is to get a job and move out of my mom's apartment (toxic relationship, etc.) but instead of telling me he can't help me with finding a job directly, I felt like he kind of beat around the bush and tried to persuade me to talk about a different topic.

Eventually I can't pay for my car insurance, gas, maintenance and phone bill anymore. But then after telling him this he told me we'll start working on my anxiety and how to cope with embarrassment and etc, etc.

I just feel like I’m scared for everyone - even those I hardly know and it’s insane and I’m insane. I’ve more so been numbing these feelings with alcohol and am looking for a better way? Or just someone who also relates? I was on anxiety meds for a while but developed a horrid allergy and I have medical anxiety and I’m just a mess in general. Honestly feel like I can’t and I don’t know how to survive in this world. &lt;/p&gt;

Context: I was diagnosed with (relatively mild but important enough for medication) GAD in March of 2021. I stopped taking the aforementioned medication for it back in March of this year (2024), and this month I reached my 4th year of therapy. 

For as long as I can remember, my anxiety has been triggered by shame, embarrassment, feeling like everyone's watching my every movement, insecurity, etc. And its consequences have been in the form of thoughts (""I can't do this"", ""people will laugh at me"", etc.) which in turn have manifested into actions (Not going out, avoiding crowded places, not taking pictures). 

Recently, what triggers my anxiety has, sort of, shifted. I feel like I am now hyper aware of my body. I don't know how to explain it, other than I am conscious of every single sensation and physical feeling: how clothes sit on my body, how my skin rubs against things, how wet or dry my skin is, the way my hair sits on my face, my swallowing, my eyelashes, how dry my eyes or lips get, how tense my muscles get, and even the tiniest itch. 

It started as something ""normal"", or at least ignorable, but it's gotten to a point where I'm starting to leave late for work because I spent 30 minutes obsessing over my hair, or having to stop in the middle of the street while I walk because my clothes don't feel right. I have found that the only thing that ""calms it down"" is to take a shower, but it's truly an awful feeling. 

I plan to talk to my therapist about this when I get to see her again next week, but in the meantime I'd like to at least understand what it might be that's causing it, because it feels somewhat unrelated to the GAD, and the only things I've found online are sensory processing issues and sensory over responsibility - which sound a bit extreme.",t2_8xknslcb,False,,0,False,"Dealing with ""body anxiety""",[],r/Anxiety,False,,adviceneeded,0,,,False,t3_1g9w571,False,light,0.84,,public,4,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice Needed,False,4,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1729639328.0,text,,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain this, and Google has come short-handed, so I thought I&amp;#39;d write something in here and just try to make some sense out of it (or have someone else make some sense out of it).&lt;/p&gt;

Symptoms:

Chest pain nearly everyday sometimes sharp usually on left side under boob sometimes dull doesn’t last longer then a hour tho! 

Recently having lymph nodes throb and hurt under my neck and a weird lump in the middle of my throat and when big it feels uncomfortable on my neck and I get weird headaches and nerve pain it feels like in legs and arms even on my face.

Headaches like weird stabbing pains on top, side and around my face throbbing and sharp pains too.

Tingling arms and legs with acheness only just started a few days ago.

Weird ear pain that goes around my head when throbing.

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone,

I’m in the early stages of planning a website aimed at helping people manage anxiety and build a supportive community. My idea is to provide a range of resources and tools for those who are struggling, and also to foster a place where people can share experiences and support each other.

Some things I’m considering include:

	•	Community support forums: A safe space to share your story, ask for advice, and find comfort from others who understand.
	•	A section on faith-based approaches: Including resources for those who find comfort in spirituality, with a specific section for Islamic perspectives since I’ve seen that faith can be a powerful source of support for many.

&lt;p&gt;I’m in the early stages of planning a website aimed at helping people manage anxiety and build a supportive community. My idea is to provide a range of resources and tools for those who are struggling, and also to foster a place where people can share experiences and support each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things I’m considering include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;• Practical resources and tools: Guided meditations, breathing exercises, and other anxiety management techniques.
• Community support forums: A safe space to share your story, ask for advice, and find comfort from others who understand.
• A section on faith-based approaches: Including resources for those who find comfort in spirituality, with a specific section for Islamic perspectives since I’ve seen that faith can be a powerful source of support for many.

,Anxiety,"I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible but I just feel miserable and I don’t know how to keep living like this. In June I woke up one day and felt extremely dizzy, tired, and like I had brain fog. I started googling and basically came to the conclusion that I could have a middle ear infection. I went to urgent care and the doctor did say that my ear was inflamed, gave me antibiotics, and said that I should feel better within the next 1-3 days. So I was absolutely obsessing over it and waiting for it to stop only for it to never stop. I went to see the doctor a few days later and he said my ear was better but still inflamed and that I was dehydrated. I still didn’t feel like I was back to normal. 

At this point I became obsessed with googling and random reddit posts trying desperately to find a diagnosis. I eventually began to think that it could be my wisdom teeth and after going to a surgeon and a dentist I did determine that I need to get them out, however the surgeon said my dizziness is probably not caused by my teeth. I honestly just started to get super freaked out and I would wake up and instantly check myself to see how I’m feeling, thinking about my dizziness, etc etc. 

This past weekend I had a sudden really sharp headache and immediately started freaking out, I was shaking, crying, felt absolutely sick afterwards, etc. It was at 3 am and my mom tried to assure me that it would be okay but I was genuinely terrified that I wouldn’t even wake up the next morning. I did (shockingly) but just felt so dizzy and out of it like usual but more extreme and I was just spiraling, I went back to urgent care (after my parents told me I should just start there and only go to the ER if necessary) and the doctor determined that I’m dehydrated and that I was panicking over something that isn’t very serious. 

I just don’t even know what to do and I’ve been wanting an MRI for months now but I’m just scared that it’s really serious and that it’s too late.

Since I was planning to leave soon, we ate in my car and started talking.

He opened up about his on-and-off relationship of two years, explaining how he’s been prioritizing himself. No matter what the outcome, he felt that things would always fall in his favor, which got me thinking about my own life.

**\[The Religious Trauma + Context for My Bad Trip\]**:  
To give you some background, I’m someone who has never really put myself first. On top of that, I’ve carried a lot of religious trauma throughout my life. Since childhood, I was told that gay people “burn in the belly of the beast,” and for a long time, I believed that. I’m now 26 and still closeted to my family, but over the past two years, I’ve worked hard to unlearn those harmful teachings. I’ve been focusing on being happy and living my life for myself, trusting that the universe will guide me. My best friend has played a huge role in that healing, alongside my therapist and SSRIs.

**\[The Trip: Buckle Up—My First Outcome\]**:  
While my friend was explaining all the outcomes he saw for himself, I started reflecting on my own. Then, for some reason, a strange thought crept in—I felt like I was being *tested*. Suddenly, it hit me: *What if my best friend is actually a demon or the devil?* What if he was sent into my life to persuade me to ignore ‘God’ and just live my life? (And honestly, I still don’t even know if God is real to me.)

As soon as that thought entered my mind, my body started overheating. I genuinely believed that the moment I had dreaded all my life was finally happening—like, *holy shit, am I about to start burning in the belly of the beast... right now???* I couldn’t accept it. I kept trying to distract myself, thinking about *my own* outcomes to escape the fear.

**\[The Simulation—Second Outcome\]**:  
This was the next outcome I came up with: *What if I just cracked the code, and I’m in a simulation?* For a second, I thought the entire world had been orchestrated for me, like someone had been controlling everything all along. I even laughed at myself as I processed the thought because it was *so absurd*. But at the same time, it freaked me out. I felt like this was some weird version of death—like I had solved the riddle, and this was how my life ended.

**\[The Healing—Third and Final Outcome\]**:  
Finally, I arrived at what felt like the most peaceful outcome. I started thinking: *What if this whole experience is actually a psychological test?* Maybe my brain *needed* to go to that first terrifying outcome—where I felt like I was burning in hell—so I could finally process and heal from my religious trauma. In a strange way, it felt like I had to fully confront that fear and come back from it to realize that everything I’d been feeling was the result of harmful beliefs ingrained in me since childhood.

While the final outcome did feel healing I still can't help and think about the first one and in how scary it felt.

Last night, I was hanging out with my best friend, and I had some of his homemade brownie edible. I didn’t have a lot, but apparently, he had no idea how much marijuana was in it, &lt;em&gt;lol&lt;/em&gt;. At first, I felt good—laughing and even getting the munchies.

,Anxiety,"
So, I (23F) have anxious attachment. I’m fully aware of this and I’ve been trying to fix it, but it’s so hard. I’m very dependent on my (25M) partner for happiness and self worth. 
I have never liked myself, in fact I’ve always hated myself. When I met my partner I felt love for the first time. I thought I maybe liked myself now. We’ve been together for over 3 years now and the relationship is mostly great.

The problem is, he is bad at communication. Like REALLY bad. I try not to be so hard on this because he has aphasia, autism, and English is not his native language. Whenever I am feeling sad or upset, he gets extremely defensive. I try to tell him “oh I’m scared because I feel alone and we are spending less time together.” He may get frustrated depending if he thinks it’s an “attack” on him. 

He is moving here soon. Recently, he has picked up a new interest. I think it’s great that he’s finding something he likes to do but there’s some major issues coming with it. I won’t be disclosing this interest because of privacy, but it involves talking and socializing with people. 
I have the same interest (though not as excessively as him). I was expecting to grow a community together with him around this thing, but he has gone off and found a community exclusively to his nationality and I’ve been completely excluded.
I tried to introduce/be more involved in the people he was meeting, but he doesn’t want me to. 
The reason? Because I’m already “better” than him in terms of social media and my small business.
He doesn’t want to help me or introduce his friends from this thing because he sees me as “better” and that “small creator” shouldn’t need to help “big creator.” Am I crazy? Shouldn’t partners support each other regardless?

Keep in mind I am anxiously attached. This whole ordeal is causing me a lot of anxiety and pain. I understand he should have his own life without me but man, it’s hard. Really hard. I wish we could have done this thing together, having the same community. I wish he would involve me more in this but I’m feeling abandoned. I’m very shy and introverted so it’s hard for me to find friends as well.

I tried expressing my emotions but alas, he doesn’t care that much. I have to walk on eggshells regardless and I can’t even share my full feelings about this to him.

There’s no way I can explain my emotions fully without him getting extremely defensive to his own side. He will not listen to me he will always want to be right. So I’m sat here just suffering in silence, anxiety and depression is slowly getting to me. I told him that I was considering seeing a psychologist, maybe even a therapist to help my anxiety, but he was opposed to it. Said something along the lines of “Just because of (this) thing? There’s no need. It will just take our time away.”

ANOTHER thing, though I think this is more of something I need to work on because I’m insecure as hell, I’m scared of him spending so much time talking to other people that he will forget me. I’m worried when we move in together he will spend more time involving himself in this interest that he will spend a lot less time with me. Possibly staying up all night doing this, then sleeping all evening that we don’t even spend time doing stuff.
It’s extremely selfish for me to say this but I wish I was the only person he is interested to talk to (aside from his family.) I try not to let these feelings interfere but it eats me up in the inside. I wish I didn’t feel this way, I may care about him too much. It may be because he’s the only person I really have aside from my own family, I don’t have friends.

I probably need to make friends but I don’t know how. Even when I try to start conversations in groups I get ignored most the time. I’m seriously struggling and I wish my partner would help me by introducing me to people, but it’s wrong.

TLDR; I have anxious attachment to my partner. He has bad communication problems. He picked up new hobby/interest that I’m also interested in. He’s excluding me from a community he’s in because I’m “better than him.” He’s dismissive of my feelings.

,Anxiety,"

Hey everyone, I’m new here about a month ago, I made the mistake of Googling something that really scared me. I’ve been diagnosed with OCD and GAD, and I was already stressed about school and dealing with GERD, but I came across something about bleeding ulcers and thought I was going to die.

On September 18, I had bad bloating and stomach pain, which I thought was just a GERD flare-up. My stomach kept growling non-stop, and I got really anxious. I searched online (big mistake) and saw some terrifying things that made me even more anxious. The pain got worse, and I was so scared I asked my mom to take me to the hospital. They gave me something for my stomach, and the pain went away, but afterward, I felt dizzy, my stomach felt tight, and I couldn’t walk straight. Later, my heart was racing, my body started twitching, and I felt like I was going to faint. It felt like a panic attack.

The next day, I still felt dizzy, lightheaded, and couldn’t concentrate. My eyes were really tired, and my heart kept racing. I was shaking, nauseous, and barely able to eat. I was so anxious I couldn’t sleep well and kept twitching. I went back to the hospital, had another panic attack, and they said it was anxiety. They recommended I talk to my doctor about adjusting my meds.

I spent the next week feeling horrible. By September 26, I started squinting and seeing double letters whenever I squinted, which freaked me out. I went to the doctor, and they said it was anxiety and prescribed me buspirone. But after just 2 days of taking it, I suddenly started seeing ghosting and double letters, and I had no idea why. I also have myopia and astigmatism, and my glasses are a few years old, but I’ve never had these issues before. The eye doctor said my eyes were fine and that it was likely temporary because of everything I’m going through.

After about two weeks on buspirone, I started feeling a little better. The shaking and twitching lessened, but I still had some pressure from school and catching up on work. Then one morning, I woke up shivering and shaking, even though it wasn’t that cold. I took a hot shower, but my legs were still shaky. The next day, I had numbness and tingling in my left foot, and my whole body felt like it was vibrating. Moving around made it worse, and I got really worried.

Now I’ve started taking citalopram, hoping it’ll help. But I still feel shaky, my foot tingles, and my body feels like it’s constantly vibrating. I’m supposed to see a psychiatrist in a couple of weeks, but I’m really concerned.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Is this something serious? I’ve shared a lot, so if you have any advice or thoughts, please let me know.

,Anxiety,Hi everyone please take the time to read because at this point I am so terribly desperate. I have been struggling with anxiety very randomly in the past before but recently it has taken a toll on my life completely. For starters I am in college and I am a 24 female. My anxiety got worse when one day i came into class and i sat down when lecture had already began. i went up a flight of stairs and as soon as i sat down i couldn’t get my heart rate down and this triggered a anxiety attack in class. i hadn’t had this happen before and i got really scared so i ended up leaving class early bc the I was started to get nauseous. after this i brushed it off. Now everytime I have this class specifically my brain has now associated with the fact that i am going to have an anxiety attack in this class. it has happened 4 times now. it has been stressing me out beyond comprehension that my anxiety has started to affect me outside of school. Where I ended up getting anxious for no reason or waking up from my sleep with an anxiety attack. It has also been happening where now everytime i feel nauseous from my anxiety it causes me to dry heaves and I have a extreme fear of vomiting especially in front of people. its especially worse when i know i have to go to school and go to this class specifically. oddly enough i don’t feel this any of my other courses. I don’t know what to do. In addition this class does stress my out a bit because I have failed 2 exams and there’s only 3 and everyone else is also struggling. I am thinking of dropping the course completely because I simply can’t take it anymore.. I graduate next semester and I could just take the course again with another professor next semester. But at the same time i’m scared that if i do drop the class it’s just me letting my anxiety win. but again i can’t seem to control it everytime I know have to go to this class..

,Anxiety,"It's the second time I start college. Last time, because of multiple reasons (namely having had a very passive approach to my life due to depression and just ending up in a place I didn't like nor chose), I quit like two days in because the anxiety was burning a hole in my stomach and making me phisically sick to the point that I had an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist because I couldn't deal with existing. As a side note: I am extremely afraid of change.

Now it's my second day at a school that I do like, but everything's still so overwhelming to me. I've met a couple of people, and my group seems nice, but just thinking about anything related to school, even about the few friends I've made, makes me a little (more managable than last time) sick. I just think about everything that could go wrong, wether I made the right choice, or if this is really what I want.
I feel like this is gonna have to become my whole life, and I don't want it, since I'm comfortable with what I have. Alas, things are meant to change, but my mind isn't being realistic at all, and there's not much I can do about that but hammering the message in.

I have a friend group that I love with all my being, I'd die for them. They're closer than family to me. I fear that college is gonna force me to make new friends to ""replace"" them in a way, that I'll have to make do with the people in my group, wether I like it or not. My therapist said that I don't HAVE to make friends as good as the ones I have now, that it's okay to have good school friends that are just that, school friends. I've turned it into a personal mantra of sorts. Still, my mind refuses to understand that.

One of the biggest things that haunts me right now is the fact that I'm fortunate enough to have a plethora of options, like studying abroad (just as some of my closest friends are doing atm), but my heart doesn't want to leave my home yet, and I'd like to think I made the right choice for me right now, but so many people would die to study abroad, and here I am staying here.

That pretty much sums it up, I'm afraid and unsure of tons of things, and trying to piece my thoughts just makes the whirlwind of my mind go wild. If any of y'all have any advice or have had any similar experiences, I'd really appreciate it, even if it's just an anecdote, anything that can help me feel identified or validated helps lots. Did y'all make it out alive? Does it get better? Did your whole life really change or is it not that HUGE of a change? Did you still have time to meet your highschool friends? Do you regret your choices?

,Anxiety,So ever since having my baby last November I have been getting palpitations or ectopic beats every day. It feels like a thump sometimes and other times it feels like a flutter. When it first started it was like 15-50 a day and got worse when I ate. They did a holter monitor and said they saw some PVCs but because it was less then 1 percent burden no cause for concern. They have gotten gradually worse and worse as time went on and they put me on metroprolol about a month after they started. The metroprolol helped tremendously and they pretty much stopped all together for a while. Then they started coming back maybe 2-3 months later and they scheduled an echo and stress test for me as well as another week long monitor. Well they upped my dose of metroprolol right before this and so the tests didn’t catch anything and once again they said I was fine. Every couple weeks or so I have had to up the metroprolol to keep them at bay and every time I start gaining a tolerance again they come back 10 times worse then they were before we upped the med. I am now feeling upwards of 500 a day or more. Every single time I eat no matter what I eat they start literally immediately after taking a few bites. I used to get random ones throughout the day and now it is like every other beat or so is a flutter or thump when I’m having an episode. I don’t experience any other symptoms besides the ectopic beats or palpitations but sometimes they knock the breath out of me and they are terrifying. My doctor and cardiologist are both kinda writing me off and blaming anxiety. I can’t see how anxiety would cause eating to trigger episodes. I have done hormone blood test and some other blood work that my pcp ordered and all came back normal. The only thing mentioned was my glucose being at 58 but they said if I hadn’t eaten much that day that could be why. I’m a mother of a 2 year old and an 11 month old and I am terrified I am gonna drop dead in front of them and they will be all alone. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions I am open. I have also started magnesium and vitamin d about a month or 2 ago and haven’t seen a change. Also I am 29. ,t2_3y61raera,False,,0,False,Please help.

It feels like a thump sometimes and other times it feels like a flutter. When it first started it was like 15-50 a day and got worse when I ate. They did a holter monitor and said they saw some PVCs but because it was less then 1 percent burden no cause for concern. They have gotten gradually worse and worse as time went on and they put me on metroprolol about a month after they started. The metroprolol helped tremendously and they pretty much stopped all together for a while. Then they started coming back maybe 2-3 months later and they scheduled an echo and stress test for me as well as another week long monitor. Well they upped my dose of metroprolol right before this and so the tests didn’t catch anything and once again they said I was fine. Every couple weeks or so I have had to up the metroprolol to keep them at bay and every time I start gaining a tolerance again they come back 10 times worse then they were before we upped the med. I am now feeling upwards of 500 a day or more. Every single time I eat no matter what I eat they start literally immediately after taking a few bites.

,Anxiety,"Hello Reddit,

After a very turmulous 2024, a recent breakup was about to send me over the edge. I had prepared notes and set myself a time and date to end my life. I had a split second rational thought to pick the phone up and call my mum. She doesn't know it but she saved my life that night. 

My anxiety operates hand in hand with my limerence thinking. I make irrational and often harsh choices and enact strange behaviours because of this. I think delusionally and always fail to think logically and objectively.

I saw my GP and expressed everything. They issued me with 50mg Sertraline. The first two days were hellish, I felt sick, had brain fog and just generally made things worse. On day three I woke up with a new found clarity. I'm only on day five now but the difference is day and night.

I've done a TON of reading on SSRI's and most people say that this is merely a placebo effect, but I can argue that my anxiety triggers are just not... triggering. I can think about the same things as before with only a hint of anxiety before it's absorbed and thrown away. My mood is stable, in that it's neither up or down. If I had to describe it, the high highs and low lows are gone. I'm kinda pleased where I am, even after five days.

It's also allowed me to think clearly again. I'm able to focus on my work, and I've even mustered the ability to remedy my appetite and create a strict diet plan.

,Anxiety,"Hi all! This will be long, feel free to scroll on. Background:

I’m 40, female, not married, live alone, two sweet kitties, great apartment, fantastic remote job, wonderful family, a loving and supportive boyfriend. I’m extremely physically active (training for an Ironman). I go to therapy every other week. I meditate every single day. I pray. I have routines. I eat healthy and wholesome food and drink a gallon of water a day. I take care of my physical health in every way. 

I was diagnosed with PD and GAD when I was 18. I spent years on Paxil which ultimately turned out to cause more harm than good. I also turned to drugs and alcohol when I was 18 to numb out the anxiety and panic. 

I became a full blown drug addict over the next 15 years. Never letting any feeling or emotion touch me. 

I got clean in February of 2017 (yay!) Since then, I’ve built this incredible life for myself and learned to love and accept myself. SO MUCH HARD WORK. 

But the panic. It’s almost always triggered by driving (alone and sometimes with someone else) or being “stuck.” Example: red lights, on a tram, highways, boats, etc. 

It’s been an ebb and flow since I got clean nearly 8 years ago. I have tried (and I’m not kidding) every medication for anxiety including off-label meds. The course I’ve been on since 2017 is clonazepam during the day (1.75mg spread out) and trazodone for sleep. My psychiatrist continues to support this. We tried a couple new SSRIs in 2022 - but both caused suicidal ideations and physical burning sensations. 

So here’s the thing. I do so much exposure therapy. I drive as much as I can, even if it’s two miles down the road to see my dad at his office. I do it even when I don’t want to. 

Lately (a month now), I can barely get a mile down the road without a panic attack. My therapist is flummoxed. Usually we can pinpoint life events to my panic. We can’t find anything. I am legitimately at the best personally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually I’ve been in years. 

I have thoughts of selling my car and just staying home. I feel like Sisyphus. I go through periods where the boulder isn’t so heavy, and then other times it’s a million pounds. 

I’m tired. I don’t want to keep pushing the boulder. I want to be able to get out and do what I want (groceries, appointments, friend meet ups). 

My therapist reminds me that my level of PD comes and goes. It’s either in remission or full blown. 

Any thoughts are appreciated. I also wonder if being 40…if my hormones are getting wonky already.

,Anxiety,"If you wanna get rid of anxiety compeletely, listen to me closely.

Root cause of anxiety came from this belief ""I need to control everything in my life to feel secure all the time"" 

But here is the irony

How can you be so vulnerable and secure at the same time ?

I mean you're vulnerable in every possible way that you can imagine because you're afraid of losing control.

There is a belief that every one of us forced to believe ""Control means power and power itself comes from control so you should control everything in order to survive in the life best possible way"". That's totally wrong but rather ""power is not related to control, power is how do you react to every situtation in the life in a most efficient way"" If you are seeking for control in every step you take you are creating an enemy which is the control itself always stabbing you from behind.

How can you develop power in yourself while you are stabbing and literally killing yourself little by little everyday ? 

And there is some comfort in here, being in control gives you false sense of security. That's like drugs the more you need to be in control the more you get addicted to that feeling of security and more you get addicted to security more you feel stuck and bored which causes anxiety.

Anxiety is a solid wall around you created by your own maladaptive and destructive thoughts call it trauma or something like that It's just a mechanism that try to protect you by ruining your life anxiety is like a toxic parent you see the pattern ?

So how do you get rid of anxiety ?

Because anxiety is a part of you now. You spent years and years with it. You listen it carefully and try to satisfy every needs of it like a slave. Now just let anxiety be your slave just let the life happen ignore it until to the point that It's no longer a threat.

I know it is very hard, i know it is so uncomfortable and scary but the only way to get out of this nighmare called anxiety is to expose yourself to the discomfort consistently. 

Anxiety is just your amygdala part of the brain pumping it's muscles all the time to the point that become so strong you can no longer ignore it. 

So start little by little expose yourself to the discomfort without giving up and turning back. And you will notice in maximum 2 weeks you are no longer the same person before you are compeletely free from it.

Lying to the woman I love 
Lying my best friend who deserves better 

One night I was swearing, shaking so bad I felt I had ran a marathon my entire shirt was soaked.

I opened up and my everything 
This women knows everything and she still decided to stay and love me which I am eternally grateful for.
I have set up therapy for tomorrow.
Good chance I have a long life of undiagnosed untreated depression and anxiety and the gym was helping me cope until I realized mentally….i wasn’t happy anymore.

I have 3-4 panic anxiety attacks since, I can’t sleep for every long anymore without waking up out of breathe. I went an ER yesterday night because it was bad again and I somehow drove me and my love to the ER. Shakes and all….i know I know not very safe but I went into high gear. 

For the first time in my life I’m dealing with a mental illness that I can FEEL but not physically. I may have slight health OCD as I focus on something different on my body and I over think it by MILES

I had a “ache” slight in my shaft and I was crying thinking I have cancer now but I have no signs and I have a very health heart etc. so I know it’s all in my head.

I’m here to vent and get opinions to help a new guy out.

So before my current relationship, I was in a year+ abusive relationship where my ex would take out their anger on me and expect me to support them.

,Anxiety,"Hi all, I've had GAD for most  of my life as well as severe panic disorder since I was around 18 (24 now) and I've been on and off of several cocktails of meds and in and out of mental hospitals since it first triggered. The only thing that's really helped me is xanax, however due to being told by my doc to take it twice every day instead of just PRN, I developed a tolerance pretty quickly and it no longer helped me that much.

I've been off meds and coping with my attacks on my own for years now, and I've been managing but frankly it's completely exhausting. I am constantly fighting and though I've been mostly winning the fight and not having bad attacks anymore, it feels like it takes all of the energy within me just to keep the flood gates from opening and absolutely falling apart again.

Now that I have a decent job with good insurance, I'm considering the idea of getting back on meds to hopefully help ease the burden and make my life less of a constant exhausting battle. I've been doing a lot of reading (bad for health anxiety I know, but I want to be sure) a lot about what meds to ask  my doc about, and I've seen beta blockers come up a lot as a possible alternative to benzos, and at first it sounded like a miracle drug since it targets basically my biggest trigger for attacks as a severe  health anxiety sufferer, which is tachycardia and too much adrenaline response.

However, after reading more about it I seem to see a conflict with fellow sufferers who take it. About half of what I see say that it basically saved their life and they've never felt better, and the other half say that the ""comedown""/withdrawal simply makes their anxiety worse and triggers even more attacks.

Of course I had to do some more reading on the possible effects and I see a lot about severe tachycardia and elevated BP and increased anxiety/adrenaline and now I'm left wondering, if it's nearly as bad as I'm reading, what is even the point of taking it when those are the exact things it's used to treat in the first place?

So, super long and probably needless exposition out of the way, I'm here to ask any people here who may be on BBs what your personal experiences are with them, and if you experience any noticeable ""comedown"" anxiety or attacks after they wear off. Do you only take them as needed? Or does your doc have you stay on them? Has it helped your anxiety/panic attacks?

,Anxiety,"Hey everyone,

I’m about 9 weeks into Nardil, and I’m feeling a bit frustrated. Four years ago, this med was a game-changer for me. It lifted me out of a tough spot and propelled me toward a much better life. I remember feeling a sense of relaxation and even euphoria that I just haven’t been able to tap into this time around.

Here’s the kicker: externally, my life is in a good place now. Things are stable, but I still feel like I’m stuck in this mental fight-or-flight mode. It’s like I’m underwater and can’t catch a break.

Last time, the relief came quickly around the 8 week mark, and it was like flipping a switch. This time, though, I’m just not feeling that same impact. I'm feeling the sweet craving and increased social interaction but not the free from stress feeling. Is it just my body adjusting, or is there something deeper at play?

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been through a similar experience. Did you eventually find that sweet spot with Nardil again, or should I be looking deeper into what’s going on mentally or investigating other avenues.

,Anxiety,"hello, I am a student and I am 20 years old.
6 months ago, I experienced my first anxiety attack, since this attack I have had a tightness in my chest that is not painful but VERY unpleasant and which worries me a lot because I have a family history (heart attacks for my father).
One evening, it was too much, I called the 17 who came to pick me up by ambulance.
Arrival at the hospital, ECG and blood test, but the doctors and nurses make fun of me by minimizing my fear and telling me that I am too young to worry about cardiovascular diseases.
Since then it's been a descent into hell, I've had a series of anxiety attacks and I don't have the impression that there's anything that triggers them, it's just very often, 3/4 per day. 
The symptoms: tightness in my chest, I struggle to breathe, I feel like I'm going to faint and my arms hurt as if my arteries were blocked. My therapist thinks I'm just afraid of death.
Thursday I'm going to have an appointment with a cardiologist to be sure.
My anxiety is ruining my life. I feel like I'm going crazy even though I controlled my emotions very well before six months ago...

,Anxiety,"**TL:DR** I am going through a period of really bad all day panic where I'm struggling to function and everything (like life?? The world?? Idk) feels scary/weird. I don't know how else to describe it or what it is, so I am hoping others can chime in and say if they’ve felt this before and share their experiences. 

**Longer version** (but I’ll try not to bore everyone): I think what kind of kicked this off is my psychiatrist tried changing up my meds. Since then I’ve been experiencing weeks where I am in a near constant panic all day, I wake up every morning between 3 and 4 with my heat racing, panicking and can’t go back to sleep. During these times I can barely function.   I can’t do things that I normally love like reading, watching a comfort show, doing a crossword, hanging with family, etc. bc it makes me feel even more anxious. I am not scared of anything in particular, other than the thought that this anxiety will never go away.  The days feel impossibly long because I am too anxious to do anything to distract myself, so that compounds the panic. 

So the main thing I want to know is has anyone ever had that feeling of really bad anxiety where the whole world/your life feels just….off and scary?

That lasted for about two years , things got kinda better , no more anxiety attacks but my level of stress was still high . I turned to food, porn, and eventually weed again to cope.

Fast forward to yesterday , amidst another anxiety attack , I realized that nothing is actually wrong with me , I’m just having anxiety. That lightbulb though brought my angst from level 10 to 2.

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone, I will keep this as short and sweet as I possibly can.

I (24m) have been dealing with very heightened anxiety the past two months. As a kid, I went through my parents divorce and a few other very stressful events. To cope, I did acid a couple times and smoked a lot of weed. As a result of all of this, I have always dealt with feelings of derealization. I was also diagnosed GAD, depression, and ADHD.

I was concussed back in May (2024) and it feels like that’s when this all started getting worse. I’ve had anxiety like this before, but now it’s different themes and weighing on me differently.

Lately I have been having horrible horrible health anxiety. It is in the form of heart disease, cancer, being scared of developing schizophrenia or psychosis, even rabies came across my mind once. I feel crazy. I am scared of getting schizophrenia because I did drugs before.

I have gotten prescribed Zoloft and buspar (had to stop the Zoloft because of side effects) and buspar has given a slight slight boost but I’m not there yet (5mg x2 a day, been taking it for about 2.5 weeks now.)

I do not experience hallucinations. I do not experience delusions to my knowledge. I do have intrusive thoughts. I do not act on them and I know they are not based in reality. I am not really sure what I’m dealing with. I have also gotten a therapist but it is almost impossible to pay for it, never mind the idea of getting a psychiatrist. These thoughts are consuming my days. I try to exercise and stay social. It is just hard to not trap myself under my blanket and research disorders. I don’t want to be like this, I want to take the next steps to being better. I am having a very very hard time finding the light at the end of the tunnel and I’m scared of spiraling out of control.

,Anxiety,"Not sure if this is the correct Reddit to post on, but whatever. 

I accidentally stopped seeing the psychiatrist I had been with for about a year. My last appointment was in November. I have diligently been on medication, mostly the same, for about ten years. Since November I have just used up my access supply of medication that I acquired over the years, until I ran out. I emailed my psychiatrist again in September, but she must have missed it. 

Since she didn’t respond after a few weeks I began the search for a new doctor. The lady I picked listed medication management, and was located in what seemed to be a science based location. 

Prior to my appointment they never requested previous medical records. When I got the appointment the lady was new to the small town, I had to explain what the recently closed suicide house was after referring to it by name. I don’t know why but that was embarrassing, and I felt like if she was a professional she should familiarize herself with the small rural options patients had access to. Okay whatever. 

When she asked what medications I was on, I told her Trazodone 100mg, gabapentin 400mg 3xs daily, methylphenidate 20 mg, and Wellbutrin 150 mg. 

I assumed since I was a new patient and she hadn’t requested my records, the methylphenidate was going to be something she probably wouldn’t write a prescription for. 

Instead I was shocked when she said, “Wow, that’s a lot of medication, and a high dose of gabapentin. I don’t prescribe gabapentin during the daytime, because it makes people like a zombie.” 

She wrote me a rx for 1 gabapentin at night to sleep🥴, and 150 mg Wellbutrin. 

I was somewhat surprised at how bad the appointment was, and offended by her zombie comment. I cancelled the follow up appointment yesterday. Today she sent a text that read, “I saw you cancelled your appt. When would you like to reschedule? How are you doing?” 

Do I/should I reply to the text? 

TLDR: I don’t know why I typed this all out. I guess my main questions are. 


Is it acceptable to say to a patient that the medication that helped them for over a decade you “don’t like to prescribe during the day because it makes people like zombies”? 

Should I reply to her text asking if I want to reschedule? I won’t be rescheduling with her. 

I heard back from my original psychiatrist after calling. Do I tell her that I have just been using up my stash of meds, or pretend I have been med free?

My father (52) has been having intense anxiety problems for the past 4 or 5 years (I think it mainly started ramping up after his mom passed away).

His anxiety has gotten so bad recently that he gave in and started going to therapy (has been going for maybe a month?). He’s also on medicine but the ones they prescribed him upsets his stomach or makes him profusely vomit. 

My mom said his anxiety has been crippling him recently, and that he has made scary comments about “just wanting it all to stop/ending it all”. He’s made scary comments like this in the past as well. Idk what to do. I live about 5-6 states away from my parents so I feel so helpless. He’s finally in therapy and taking medicine like my sister and I asked but they seem to be making him worse?

,Anxiety,"Hi !

I'm just posting there because I need help with my anxiety. 
Two years ago I had a terrible reaction to medecine, I'll not say anything else on what happened to not create fear on people.

It's been two years now that I constantly have a different fear regarding various illnesses. 

One month ago the fears got stronger I'm doing even more panic attack and I am having lot of symptoms.
Now I am fearing a disease and having a lot of symptoms, I had pain in the arms I had pain in hand pain in legs... And know I'm struggling because I am sure I have this deseases (the one that prevent muscles from moving).

This morning I got to doctor that said that I don't have any real disorder that can make think of this desease. He gave me fluoxetine and said that everything may be linked to my anxiety. I'm ok with that statement but I'm still worried and still thinking I have what I fear.

I may need to talk to someone I need help because I think I can't handle this fear for too long. 
Did someone experienced similar symptoms because of anxiety ? 

Pain in legs flr example ? Or sometime felling that it stretch when moving ? 
I know that I may be hard to understand but I need someone to tell me that it's going to be ok....

,Anxiety,"Hey everyone,

I have a close friend who struggles with social anxiety, and lately, it feels like all he wants to do is rant about how unfairly he’s treated compared to more popular people. He constantly complains that when he says something, people ignore him, but when a popular kid says the same thing, they get praised. It’s the same topic nearly every time we talk, and it’s really starting to wear me down.

I’ve tried offering him perspective. I told him that if someone like Elon Musk tweets a quote, it’ll get millions of likes because he’s worked hard to build his influence. If an average person tweets the same thing, it might not get noticed. It’s not just about what’s being said but who’s saying it. He seemed to understand but hasn’t stopped the constant complaints. He even admitted that he just wants to rant all the time, which makes me feel like he’s not even open to changing things.

He’s also upset about being rejected by girls but doesn’t put in the effort to improve his situation. There are people in our school with the same height, socioeconomic background, and race as him, but they are more popular or have better social lives because they’ve put in the effort to work on themselves. It’s not just about luck; it’s about working on yourself.

He complains about his lack of confidence but doesn’t take any initiative to try and build it. There are so many tools and practices out there that could help—self-help books, joining clubs, practicing social skills, or even pushing himself a bit out of his comfort zone. But he doesn’t seem interested in trying any of these. He just wants to keep talking about how tough things are.

One thing that frustrates me a lot is that he was bullied for having dandruff, which really affected his self-esteem. I even recommended a solution (Nizoral shampoo) to help him get rid of it, but he hasn’t taken any steps to try it. It feels like there are solutions available, but he’s just not willing to take them.

I understand that he has PTSD from being bullied when he was younger, and that this affects his ability to put himself out there. He used to play football but would often cry when he didn’t perform well instead of trying to improve. Even now, he seems aware that he’s not putting in the effort, but he’s stuck in this cycle of complaining without taking action.

He sees a therapist once a month, but that doesn’t seem to help with the ranting. I do care about him and want to be supportive, but I’m starting to feel drained by the one-sided conversations. I want to be there for him, but I also need to protect my own mental well-being. How do I set boundaries without seeming unsupportive or harsh? Has anyone been through something similar, and how did you manage it?

Any advice would be really appreciated",t2_5f8hbvtn,False,,0,False,"Friend with SAD keeps non stop ranting, gets upset often but is unwilling to make a change ",[],r/Anxiety,False,,lovedones,0,,,False,t3_1g9knto,False,light,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Help A Loved One,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1729610294.0,text,,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a close friend who struggles with social anxiety, and lately, it feels like all he wants to do is rant about how unfairly he’s treated compared to more popular people. He constantly complains that when he says something, people ignore him, but when a popular kid says the same thing, they get praised. It’s the same topic nearly every time we talk, and it’s really starting to wear me down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried offering him perspective. I told him that if someone like Elon Musk tweets a quote, it’ll get millions of likes because he’s worked hard to build his influence. If an average person tweets the same thing, it might not get noticed. It’s not just about what’s being said but who’s saying it. He seemed to understand but hasn’t stopped the constant complaints. He even admitted that he just wants to rant all the time, which makes me feel like he’s not even open to changing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s also upset about being rejected by girls but doesn’t put in the effort to improve his situation. There are people in our school with the same height, socioeconomic background, and race as him, but they are more popular or have better social lives because they’ve put in the effort to work on themselves. It’s not just about luck; it’s about working on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He complains about his lack of confidence but doesn’t take any initiative to try and build it. There are so many tools and practices out there that could help—self-help books, joining clubs, practicing social skills, or even pushing himself a bit out of his comfort zone. But he doesn’t seem interested in trying any of these. He just wants to keep talking about how tough things are.&lt;/p&gt;

5mg for the first 8 days a pill before sleep (from tonight I'll be taking 10mg):  
I've been righting notes whenever I was feeling to...  
heads up English is not my first language...

Day 1:

When I took the pill i was able to sleep easily in less than 30 mins, idk if it's because i think the pill will fix me or not.

I had this urge of wanting to shake my body parts which is used to happen, but it was so low, like i can stop it easily or decide not to do it.

I don't think I had overthinking but I had some panic attacks (I hit the wall during the day)

I was so tired after classes, sometimes I wanted just to hit the floor and lay down

In the night my body parts started to have the urge to shake, idk if I'm controlling or not, i can stop it but it starts easily

Day 2:

I slept well today, in less than 30 mins after taking the pill

And I woke up great

I feel so anxious and being angry for the smallest things but I can control it, I feel anxious and more tensioned

I can not interact well with people, I feel so moody

Some mode swings

19:26 i feel sleepy, tired ( all I'm thinking about it to go to bed and sleep)

I feel some headache with some nausea

Day 3:

I slept very early yesterday, sleeping become no issue for me, but i slept for 10 hours and had to force myself to wake up and get up from the bed with headache and nausea.

Having panic attacks when I try to do any task

I feel left out, in the same time I'm kicking out close people from life, what I'm doing is bad

I'm about to freak out now

Day 4

Still so anxious, having slept well, I had to be awake for long time after taking the pill, not feeling goos for some personal reasons

I feel like I'm about to lose my mind anytime soon

I want to disappear

Actually today I am feeling good I don't know what happened but suddenly everything start feel like I am in a positive mood I'm happy I don't know why but no reason

Day 5,6,7:

I have not written anything in this 3 days does I didn't feel like I want to write anything it was like up and down sometimes give sometimes bad terrapher wings in a second academy happy and then I can be so sad I feel so overwhelmed with emotions and I have exams this week and then next week so hard for me to handle this.

,Anxiety,"Hi, I have had two panic attacks (or at least I think they are) in my life one after I smoked again after quitting for awhile and then randomly a month after getting off birth control and when I felt the same symptoms I did when I had my first panic attack. After my 2nd one I’ve been experiencing a lot more anxiety than I ever have. 

Mine manifests in my chest and I feel like I’m not getting enough air or like I’m manually breathing. This started about 3 months ago after I had what I think was my 2nd panic attack. Now every time I feel a similar feeling (specifically the feeling of lack of proper breathing) it gives me more anxiety and I think I’m going to spiral and have another panic attack. 

It’s like I get anxiety about having anxiety which makes the anxiety worse. It’s a vicious cycle and I really need it to stop:/ I don’t know what to do and idk why this is happening (maybe birth control withdrawal?) or maybe something deeper. I would like to blame it on the birth control but it’s getting harder to do that as time goes on. It gets increasingly worse the morning after a night of drinking also. I never rlly struggled with hangxiety until my 2nd panic attack. Ever since then I’m dealing with episodes of anxiety and when I feel the physical symptoms I get ever more anxious and worry about having another panic attack. Please help!!!

Does this sound similar to any one else’s experience? Does anyone know what this is? Any recommendations please?
