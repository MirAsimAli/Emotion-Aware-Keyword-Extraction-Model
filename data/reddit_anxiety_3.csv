,Anxietyhelp,"I haven't had an attack for so many months I honestly thought I was getting better ._.' 

A couple of days ago I had a anxiety attack, out of the blue. 

The part that sucks is I can't figure what triggered it, as it wasn't the trigger it was months ago (I am well aware I am over it). 

I have no clue how it started. A chest pain and breathing doesn't fix anything. 

So many weeks in therapy and now I have forgotten how I was supposed to control these attacks. Feel so stupid and helpless.

This could be because of the worm stress but I have been working so hard to reduce it, and so a large extent it wayyy less than what it was a month ago, so I don't think it was this.

I am writing this now because it happened again, and i still can't figure out why. I thought I was better. 

I think it's still a long way to go. My chest hurts and idk what to do. Can you recommend what to do :)? 

I'll be restocking my sos meds tomorrow.

,Anxietyhelp,"This is going to sound really weird so bare with me, a few weeks ago I had appetite issues off and on, some anxiety too obviously, and it all element full circle when I noticed my pants felt a little loose one day, and when I weighed myself then I was 148 lbs, which is only two lbs less than my standard I've been for like years. I measured my high waist which is still around 31 inches, and my hips/butt which is 43 inches, these measurements are my normal, maybe like 1/12th less than my normal I guess. My pants that I can never button usually without sucking in and pulling, now I can button more easily, but my waist and hips are the same measurements as before? I've weighed myself once every morning for the last two weeks, in the morning, after going to the bathroom, before food, same spot, and naked, I've been consistently between 147-150 back and forth, my last weigh this morning being 149. My waist and hips are still 31 and 43, but my pants still 'fit' better. I noticed yesterday that my belly button looked different, like, softer. I sat down and sucked in my stomach and saw a horizontal crease fold in at my belly button area, effectively pulling in my button and creating a crease there at my lower waist, I freaked out cause I don't think I've noticed that or been able to do that. Then I started meticulously inspecting my body and noticed I have a friggen FUPA now, like, that area looks more 'saggy'  and 'fatter' than I remember, and a crease fold of skin at my bikini lines at certain positions like sitting or crouching. When looking up all this, it said it can be caused by ""significant weight loss in a short amount of time"". Now I'm paranoid thats what's happening to me, even though both of my scales, and my measuring tape, say nothing's really changed but my friggen clothes say the opposite. Also, no one has asked me if I'm losing weight, and my bf says I look exactly the same, even when looking at older photos of me from months ago for reference. The only difference I really really notice is that my abdominal distending i usually always have is much less. Often I look 3 months pregnant at all times, and had been asked that many times too when I was expecting...nope, just constantly bloated. Ever since I noticed my pants are looser, I've noticed that area is much less protuberant and firm, to the point now where...apparently, it is soft and I can suck in my belly button way into me, and that weirds me out cause I am paranoid to death that this is all like, that loose skin that happens to people after extreme weight loss.

Since this allllllll started, I've been worried that I'm losing body mass for no reason, my brain kept thinking I have advanced cancer, you know, where your body starts to waste away without you even trying.

,Anxietyhelp,"About a week ago I was stung 3 times by a scorpion and I was okay but now every time I go outside I slightly panic that somehow another one has climbed into my clothing. 

What had happened was I walked my dog very early in the morning and I was wearing a hoodie and when I went to pick up her poop from someone’s yard it climbed up my sleeve and about 10 feet from where I picked up the poop started to sting me repeatedly. I assumed I stepped in an ant pile and rushed home to change and check the dog but upon turning my clothes inside out a scorpion fell out. I was in shock and trying not to panic so I put it in a jar checked the dog then called poison control. It turned out to be the most venomous in the US but  even at that they say that most healthy people would be fine just to take some over the counter meds. I ended up being okay but later that day when the meds wore off I felt like I was being stung again and again on every scar and old injury and that lasted for about 12 hours. 

So now my issue is whenever my clothing hair or anything barely touches my skin I get the sensation again that I am being stung. It’s of course not as severe as it was the first day but this has been happening for a week now and I am going crazy. I have to walk my dogs everyday sometimes twice a day and I’m constantly walking by places scorpions would be. Sometimes I stop mid walk and triple check all my clothes and the dogs to confirm there’s none on us. I know this is all probably due to my anxiety but I have no idea how to make it stop. I just want to be able to go more than 30 minutes without my body convincing me I’m being stung again. 

If you have been stung before and had anxiety about it happening again, what did you do to get past it? Do I just have to wait it out?

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey Redditors! 👋

Just stumbled upon this eye-opening article on **secret anxiety hacks therapists use themselves**—and, let me tell you, it’s a game-changer! 🧠 As someone who's dealt with anxiety on and off, it’s refreshing to see the pros being *real* about what actually works for them, not just their clients.

The article dives into practical techniques like:
- **Grounding exercises** that instantly shift your mind back to the *present* 🌍
- Simple yet *powerful* breathing methods therapists swear by 🧘
- How to reframe thoughts when you’re spiraling 🌪️

Honestly, this read left me feeling like I finally have a *survival guide* that’s actually realistic and doable (and doesn’t take hours or cost $$). 💪💸

If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by the sea of advice out there, or just want to hear how therapists keep *their own* minds in check, definitely give this a read! I’d love to hear if any of you have tried these techniques—or have others that work wonders! Drop your thoughts! 👇

I have throat constriction from anxiety, every time I swallow food, water, and saliva it creates a ticking sound, for it's loud but from in outer perspective it wasn't. They mocked, ridiculed, and bullied me using hurtful words, and they always did that for 8 months. For 8 months, I wished my throat constriction from anxiety would be gone and every time they opened their mouth, I couldn't help but smile about every thing they said because I knew they were wrong. Every time I swallow it creates a sound and then my neighbors will be noisy, every second I wish to end this and focus on things within my control and I always tell myself that I will ignore these people but I can't.  I can't even study properly and I can only feel it is anger. I tried breathing exercises, but every time I exhaled they thought I was scaring them. When I said that bad things to myself, they thought it was about them. They spread lies and people believed them because I smiled every time people criticized me.

 Thankfully, throat constriction from anxiety is gone now but I've gained a habit of smiling every time I hear people talking I can't help but smile, even in public transportation where passengers are talking, my anxiety goes up and then sooner or later I will smile. This happens when a person is having a conversation that has nothing to do with me. The outcome still haunts me and I don't know what to do.

,Anxietyhelp,"I'm a 20 year old college student and I have been anxious for this whole month. It all started a month ago when I had covid. Even though it was pretty mild, a week after I got over the initial infection I started experiencing insomnia which was triggered by a panic attack that I didn't know I had at the time, but thinking back on it it was definitely a panic attack. After that night I woke up with a feeling of my thoughts having ""slowed down"" which made me go down a googling frenzy and conclude I have brain fog and long covid ( I didn't have any other symptoms of long covid and I wasn't cognitively impaired, I could still think normally, solve problems and understand everything being said to me, but I had a feeling my brain was thinking ""more slowly"" and it made me a bit forgetful when I would actively try to remember something even though id remember it a couple minutes later) and it sent me down a health anxiety frenzy which made me experience a horrible panic attack a week later which sent me to the ER. I have been getting better for quite a bit, I can sleep normally and don't wake up during the night, most of my health anxiety symptoms are gone and I don't frantically google symptoms anymore, but regular anxiety still persists till this day. At the beginning I was feeling anxious the whole day, but now it has subdued and I only feel anxious at night and sometimes during the day, but my worst ""symptom"" is crying. At night for some reason I cry because of this constant feeling of doom that I will never recover from this feeling and that I will always feel like this and there's no help for me. During the day I am completely high functioning, I can go to uni without a problem, I recently found a student job and I have no problem completing tasks there, but at night I feel like everything suddenly comes down and I just feel awful. I would like to know if anyone has experienced anything similar and if it kind of gradually goes away on it's own or if it's something I should definitely see a therapist about. My mom's take on this is that I'm stuck in a depressive episode because of some reason (most likely uni) because I've switched majors this year because I didn't do well last year which created a  fear or not doing good this year either but I'm not sure that's the reason because when I think about it it doesn't make me actively scared, but again it could be subconscious.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi all, I've dealt with anxiety in the past and used to take meds for it, but decided to stop the meds over a year ago but I am still doing therapy.

I'm in my late 20s and I'm happy to say my anxiety levels are 1000x better than they were in my teenage-early 20s years, however, I still have bouts from time to time and am currently having one right now. Whenever I have these episodes, it's usually over the smallest things.

For example, I'm currently stressed/anxious because I was planning to have a normal Friday night at home, but my boss asked if I would like to join a few colleagues for a casual business dinner after work with a vendor of ours. This isn't the craziest scenario in the world, and I have no issues at all with going, but it did throw my day off a bit even if I didn't have plans this evening. I feel like I need time to process things a few days in advance, although I know life doesn't work that way and it's something I need to work on. 

As for the anxiety, I'm not anxious about the dinner or meeting new people, but rather the small things beforehand, like if the work clothes I'm wearing currently are fine to wear, if we're all going to ride together to the restaurant or separately, and where to park (the place is in a notoriously difficult spot to park). Typing this out makes it seem ridiculous, but I always stress about these small aspects.

I know I could just ask a colleague what their plan is, or what they're going to wear, but my main internal battle is that it seems like most people don't worry about these things, so why do I?

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey everybody,

I don’t really post on here, but I don’t know where else to ask. I was taking SSNI’s(duloxetine), I found that escilitopram was causing my emotions to be quite mute, not the bad ones just all of them really. Anyways, I was on duloxetine, because I felt as though my previous medication was impacting my sleep and stress. Anyway, a big source of my stress is my relationship. I’ve grown up around bad relationships and my view of them has always been skewed. I am constantly stressed about mine to the point of being ROCD, because nothing is truly wrong, I will just ruminate and make things up as I go. Anyways, I was curious to know what anyone’s experience was with neuroperpherine, I read that SSNI’s are linked to fight or flight response, my issue is they don’t state if they suppress it or exacerbate it, I’d imagine they’d help limit them, but for me when I started the SSNI my fight or flight is continuously active when with my significant other for literally no reason, especially when I first wake up. 
Curious to know if anyone can provide some insight, I switched back to SSRI’s recently and probably have been feeling a bit of withdrawal, but it’ll be better than continuous stress.

I do know that i have overthinking but never anxiety and for the first time in my life i cried because of it. As i’m typing this i have just finished crying. 

So this overthinking anxiety came from passwords gmail login stuff basically. So a week ago someone attempted to log onto my Amazon which they failed because i denied and secured my account and after talking to the customer services every day including today they all reassured me that my account is very safe and secured but idk why i’m still bothered about it. Mind you i never shopped on there never added any cards i only have Amazon to register my kindle—i know it sound stupid i’m sorry. So idk why im so worried about it. 

And this led me to overthink about my gmails and phone number and secured my account. Idk idk idk somebody please help me. I prayed, i talked to my friends about it, told myself to chill and relax and just now I cried because i heard it helps but idk.

,Anxietyhelp," I have 22/7 horrific anxiety. I have it all day long, just constant, then I only sleep 2 to 3 hours a night so I have it 22/7. I go from anxious to super anxious, to panicking. 

For example. 

1. There is no reason I have anxiety. 
When I read about anxiety, they talk about how people think, “if I do this I’m going to die” or “if I do this something bad is gonna happen.” I don’t get those thoughts! I don’t ever think I’m going to die or something bad  is going to happen if I do anything. The feeling is just always there! 

2. I don’t avoid things because of my anxiety. 
I heard experts talk about how to help lessen the anxiety by embracing it and pushing through things. Eventually, your brain will learn that nothing bad is going to happen, so it will stop getting so anxious for those things. For example, “ I accept you anxiety, and I’m still going to leave the house..” I’m a mom, I have to push through everything. I don’t have a choice…. And it has never got better.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi all,

I really need help on managing my anxiety as it’s taking a toll on my daily life. My day usually goes like this:

- When I wake up for the day, I’m automatically anxious, have chest pain and a sense of dread. I feel like I’m about to cry/will cry sometime later as well.

- If it’s a day where I’m going to classes (majority of my week), I feel really upset/anxious on the way to university. Once I reach class, it’s really hard to pay attention to the content being taught and also interacting with others is hard as well. Whenever something related to schoolwork is mentioned, my chest starts to hurt worse and worse.

- Going home after classes, it’s really hard to keep my tears in. 99% of the time I end up crying once arriving home and my anxiety will last for most of the day, sometimes the whole day. Recently, I’ve been crying a lot for the past days over an exam coming up (which is tomorrow) and it interferes with my plans, such as wanting to review/study, relax before bed, eating, etc.

Overall, I’m constantly extremely anxious, which causes me to have chest pains/heart palpations, crying daily, nausea, etc. I try my best not to overthink or anything, but it consumes my thoughts completely and I can’t stop it. My brain starts to make situations seem 10x worse than they are (ex. feeling like I’m going to die if I fail an exam, I’m going to die if I can’t *insert activity*, etc.). I also feel that something bad is going to happen to me if I don’t do something or if I get a negative result from something (ex. grades). Even the smallest changes in my day is enough to make me cry. It’s been to this extent ever since classes started for the semester, however, I’ve always been anxious before classes started anyway.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey Reddit fam! 👋

I just came across this eye-opening article on anxiety relief, and I had to share it with you all. You know how we often hear about the *usual* ways to manage anxiety? Things like ""just think positive"" or ""try to relax more""? Well, this piece flips that script and dives deep into how many mainstream approaches might not be as helpful as we think.

🧠 It explores:
- Why trying to eliminate anxiety can actually make it worse.
- How accepting and understanding anxiety (instead of fighting it) can lead to REAL relief.
- The importance of listening to our bodies, not just our minds.
- And why some advice we've all heard might be doing more harm than good.

If you've ever felt stuck in an endless loop of trying to control anxiety and failing, this article is a refreshing perspective! Definitely worth a read if you're looking for new ways to understand and manage anxiety.

I have been struggling with *severe* health anxiety for the past year and a half. I had a panic attack a couple days ago because I simply COULD NOT stop being so aware of my heart beat. It felt like it was beating out of my chest, but then I would feel my pulse in my neck and my heart rate, and it was beating at a totally normal rate. It then sent me into a frenzy because I simply could not stop constantly thinking about my heart beating, and somehow it started to make my heart feel ""sore"". I then had a horrible (and irrational) thought that since I can't stop constantly feeling my heart beat, my heart was always going to feel sore as long as it's beating, and the only way it would stop feeling sore is when I die, and it just started to feel like I had an entire life of chest pain ahead of me...it sounds utterly insane, I understand this.

Obviously having health anxiety means that I am AFRAID OF DEATH, so you would think that me feeling my heart beating (aka **the** **#1 sign of BEING ALIVE**) would give me comfort. Ever since that night, I cannot seem to shake the feeling that I am on the cusp of a panic attack around every corner. I'll finally be distracted and feeling fine, and then that panic attack will flash in my mind, and then I start having anxiety about having anxiety... It is the cruelest cycle I have ever experienced.

I just need tips on what I can do to stop constantly being so aware of my bodily functions. I take Ashwagandha, and that has done WONDERS for me, but it's starting to not be enough. Being medicated has never been an option for me; I've wanted to do everything in my realm of possibility to help my anxiety before turning to prescription medication. But after that panic attack, that option has definitely entered the chatroom...

How do I shake this feeling? I cannot live like this. I am in no way suicidal (I am terrified of death), but I can totally see how someone could get to a place where they want to end it all if they have consistent anxiety/panic attacks like the one I had Friday. I just want my brain to stop throwing myself into having anxiety attacks when nothing is even happening; I am literally getting anxiety about having anxiety. Any help or advice is welcomed.

Hey guys,

Long story short, 3 years ago,
Multiple panic attacks had to got to the doctors multiple times.
Had tachycardia a few times.

Sweaty hands and body and face 24-7.

I am recovering and the progress is amazing!

What did I do?

I changed my mentality and thoughts.

I don’t believe I got anxiety out of nowhere I believe things like bullying, and trauma caused it for me.

I had negative thoughts for years.

Until one day I started shifting my thoughts.

This video will explain everything in detail.

I really want you guys to give positive affirmations and positive talks and frequency changing a go.
Please you have nothing to lose.

,Anxietyhelp,"A few days ago, I mistakenly ate a THC-infused cookie, unaware of the intense effects it would have on me. Since I hadn’t consumed any form of THC for the past eight years, the experience hit me far harder than I expected. To my surprise, the effects lasted not just for a few hours but for several days, and they were significantly worse than I imagined—worse even than my past experiences with psychedelics like mushrooms.

The initial trip lasted about 12 hours, and the first six hours were the most intense. I experienced vivid hallucinations—both visual and auditory. I saw strange, distorted images and heard bizarre sounds that weren’t real. At the same time, I felt incredibly sick to my stomach, but no matter how nauseous I felt, I couldn’t throw up. I was trapped in this deeply uncomfortable state, with overwhelming anxiety and a strange out-of-body feeling that left me feeling disconnected from reality.

Over the next few days, I expected the symptoms to subside, but to my concern, they persisted. I’m now on day four, and while the intensity has faded somewhat, I’m still dealing with anxiety, blurred vision that comes and goes, dry mouth and throat, and occasional breathing difficulties due to the dryness. My stomach remains unsettled, and I occasionally feel mentally foggy, with odd thoughts drifting in and out.

I’ve never experienced anything like this before, not even during my mushroom trips in my teens.

,Anxietyhelp,"I am very aware of the fact that we are still extremely young and that teen relationships usually don’t last due to insufficient maturity, lack of communication, emotional instability, etc….
I’ve always been very cautious of relationships because i have a huge fear of getting into a toxic one and not being able to get out. Me and my boyfriend have known each other for almost a year, but we only started dating two months ago since i asked him out. He made it abundantly clear that he’s interested in me from the beginning but i was so scared of toxic relationships that i waited a long time until i felt we know each other well enough to start dating. Ever sine we got together we have obviously been spending more time with each other than we did as friends and the more time you spend with someone the more you get to know them and all their sides. I have diagnosed anxiety stemming from trauma which lead to an anxious attachment style, he comes from a very stable home and is quite healthy but had a toxic relationship before me where they never communicated with each other and showed little love. He isn’t toxic or anything since it was mostly his ex who was extremely emotionally unavailable and  me being a good communicator and showing him tons of love helps him open up and do the same but obviously he not as expressive as i am. So, i have one main issue. Sometimes my boyfriend will do small things that hurt me or piss me off a little but the problem is I cannot differentiate between when it’s actually a problem and when its my anxiety looking for triggers and issues where there are none. Sometimes he will be a dry Texter in my eyes and i will get extremely scared thinking he doesn’t love me anymore while he didn’t even notice that he was apparently „being dry“. Sometimes he`ll make a small joke like when you tease your partner a bit and ill get really upset. (When i communicate my feelings He reacts very well no worries, even if he doesn’t quite understand why i feel the way that i do he will still listen and try to change regardless.) I’m always very paranoid he doesn’t love me despite him doing everything for me. He’s not very verbal when being affectionate since its hard for him due to the past relationship, but he‘ll write me letters, buy me stuff, always make time for me, do my work for me etc etc to show me he loves me while im very verbal and constantly express my love to him through words. 
Anyways, my main issue is that I can’t differentiate between an anxious reaction and an actual problem. Communication is important but me communicating every issue can be controlling and ruin the relationship. Sometimes the way i react is the issue not what he did but I don’t know which is which. When I don’t communicate i just feel like im letting some negative feelings build up.

Do you have any advice for anxious partners? Or maybe something i could read/watch? I want to be able to separate anxiety from real issue to better my relationship but idk where to start.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hello, I am 37 M mid-Atlantic region of the United States. I am autistic, and to be blunt I can be a little bit different. I have never really fit in or found my group of friends. And that is fine I am happy and content with my life. Over the years I have learned to have fun all alone, but socially I have become more and more isolated over the years.

I am not complaining, I am an introvert, I am a homebody. I do not want to be popular or be famous or anything like that. I am a very private person, and I am very happy with my life.

With all that said I am single and have been single all my life. I do not have any friends (other than family) but I do not feel their absence at all. I will admit I feel the absence of a girlfriend in my life. The problem is I live with my parents and I am a homebody. Not the easiest for me to meet people and get dates.

I have been asking questions on reddit about how I could possibly get into a relationship. The advice has been solid and many people have been kind enough to write something, all of which I am super appreciative of. Most of the advice revolves around going out, joining groups, and communities and meeting people in real life.

I have no doubt this is great and by far the most useful advice. I am sure it works the best by far. I just do not really see it working for me. Even though I am very shy and have social anxiety I am not agoraphobic or anything. I just do not really talk or get along with other people all that well.

For example, I went out to lunch today. It was nothing fancy just a Jersey Mikes. The guy who took my order was overly friendly and talking with everyone as they ordered. While I do not mind being polite and giving my order. I get very uncomfortable when he asks personal questions like ""What do I have going on the rest of the day?"" I get that it must make me seem like a very unkind person. But that general kind of polite small talk has always been torture for me. A few other people were talking while I was getting my sandwich. 

I just realized (for like the 10,000th time) that meeting people in public like that is just not nor do I think it could ever be me. It is just not something I think I could ever do. I do not think I could meet people at bars, or meet up events, or group events, or stores or restaurants or anything like that.

I have been going out alone for a very long time all the time. I do not make connections and start talking to people the way other people seem to. 

Like I said I always get that advice. I try to tell people those things are just not for me. I get it when other people get frustrated with me for not being able to do those things, since they seem to be what work best for most people. But at least with me I do not think they will ever work.

I like getting responses, I like meeting people online, I like having a bit of conversation on here. And I have found if I ask a question or something like that people are more likely to respond. But I am not sure I am looking for advice. 

It just feels frustrating to know that the one way of getting into a relationship that people love to give as advice just will probably never work for me. Thank you so much.

&lt;p&gt;It just feels frustrating to know that the one way of getting into a relationship that people love to give as advice just will probably never work for me. Thank you so much. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"(I live in France)

I've had a few experiences with psychiatrists these last few years. I've seen one for a few months 4 years ago, we talked, she prescribed a variety of anti-depressants over the course of those months and nothing worked. I stopped seeing her but I don't really remember why.

I've seen another one last year regarding my need to adress untreated ADHD. She was an unsufferable greedy cunt so I quickly stopped. I still managed to get a prescription for ADHD medication but I backed down because of how it butchers sleep and hunger, which are the very last things I need.

While searching for a new psychiastrist, I looked at google reviews and they're 90% of the times disastrous. Those people charge 80€+ for barely half an hour, they lack empathy and treat people like shit. Out of 30 profiles, A SINGLE ONE had more than 2,5 out of 5 stars.

My anxiety causes me to always face the void and ruminate about the absurd. I sleep very badly, I wake up with a start multiple times per night with my heart racing while I face the unbearable horror of existence and consciousness for a few seconds in a state of mind that feels like its mental barriers went down for a few seconds.

I feel like there's no answer but medication for my condition so that's why I want to see a psychiastrist.

I recently blew (again) a very rare chance of connexion and intimacy with someone by being incapable of sexualizing my behavior because of anxiety and fear of sexuality and I barely can take it. Now there's this awkwardness between us, I feel humiliated and eternally condemned to despair and failure.

I'll be 30 tomorrow, time is passing and I've know nothing but constant suffering for the last 20 years, I need to find a solution.

So please tell me anything you might have to say about psychiastrists, medication or natural ways to ease anxiety.

He reassured me saying things like I'm not going anywhere, I was the one. I had a great relationship w his family they all said I take care of him so well and I look at him like no one ever has. With the exception of my anxiety I was a great gf. His needs were all met as I could tell and he always said I took good care of him. He was in hospital 1 mth ago and I didn't even think twice about getting him better. I cooked, cleaned, shopped I got up early so he didn't have to make his lunches for work. We truly had something magical. As my anxiety got worse I decided ok I need therapy before I lose him. I had one session(finances and scheduling got in the way). I was dedicated I said I will get better. I tried to go to him less, I tried to self soothe but I didn't have the coping mechanisms so I kept going to him. He is very mild mannered, never raise his voice, kind to everyone. In the past 3mths he yelled at me 3 times. He said he couldnt take the getting angry anymore. We had a fight I apologized bc it was the same thing: went to dinner w his bro and sis in law they were asking direct questions about our future to which I was answering and he wasn't saying a word so I got in my head in a loop and on the way home he asked if I was mad. I said yes I was immature i said I was hurt and I said why don't you want to talk about our future. He got mad and said he was done. He asked me to leave our apartment ( he pd the rent I paid flr everything else) my name wasn't on rent etc but I said no one is leaving I wanna talk it out. He warned me from day 1 he never goes back to an ex, once the relationship ends it ends for a reason. But I thought I was different bc he said I was the one, he never lived w anyone, his family loved me. He said i wasn't the person he fell in love with anymore that I became my anxieyy and I crushed us. He said while he's loved me the most out of anyone he didn't like the person he was becoming (angry, having to constantly reassure me). I don't feel this is valid enough to leave over. If I was that special and different give me time to get more therapy and get the skills to.stop doing what I'm doing to hurt you. I would never leave. I don't get how you loved me, promised me you weren't going anywhere he saod this daily and then the night of the breaking up said he LOVED me past tense...how is he okay without me, how is our future gone bc you don't like who you are when youre annoyed sometimes...isn't the good stuff far out weighing the bad. I begged, pleaded I said I'd do therapy 5x a week, I'd stay w my parents so we can work on it. He said no, he's never coming back and that I had opportunities to improve the last few months. He said he no longer had to justify staying. I hope he didn't mean it when he said he wasted the last year with me, i wasn't his problem anymore and he'd rather be alone than with me.

Heya,

I went to a doctors appointment this morning as I was anxious about a suspected clubbed nail.

My doctor had a look at my nails, used a stethoscope, checked my neck, ears, ankles/wrists but also checked my blood oxygen levels. I remember him saying something about 90%? Isn’t this super low? I also had gel nails on so I was confused whether my reading would be accurate 

He said that my lungs/heart sounded healthy and I was fine.

I have health anxiety so I’m a tad worried like what if he missed something?

After finishing I went to a university to continue my training, I had extremely bad anxiety the first 3 days of moving into the school but it left me. Then a month later when I started flying it came back with extreme force never had any anxiety during ground training(Matter of fact during my ground I felt extremely motivated) I was throwing up and couldn’t even form a sentence. So I dropped out after my 4th lesson 
And was extremely disappointed in myself. But I got accepted to do liberty online ( I was thinking that maybe living four hours away may have contributed) only 3 weeks after dropping out. But I continued to have anxiety on and off and started classes yesterday and I had my first flight lesson too ( the flight school is two hours away) I did absolutely TERRIBLE in my flight because I haven’t flown in two months. But other than that I was extremely excited and motivated for this. But I got home and started working on my school and relapsed worse. I’m so tired of constantly having this anxiety I honestly can’t keep living like this, I can’t imagine myself doing anything else but I can’t see myself continuing if it doesn’t stop. I’ve talked with my CFIIs and they said it’s normal but I don’t think they understand how bad it is. 

Also, I’ve never had anxiety like this since I was  8-10 but we figured out it was pandas and got on medication and was completely fine till August 14th.

It builds up to the point where I don’t get any sleep the previous night and after that dealing with anxiety becomes really challenging.

It starts with me feeling tired and then thinking that I am going to faint. I simultaneously also feel like crying because I feel stuck in my panic. Then I get exhausted more and the cycle repeats itself.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey everyone,

I’m about 9 weeks into Nardil, and I’m feeling a bit frustrated. Four years ago, this med was a game-changer for me. It lifted me out of a tough spot and propelled me toward a much better life. I remember feeling a sense of relaxation and even euphoria that I just haven’t been able to tap into this time around.

Here’s the kicker: externally, my life is in a good place now. Things are stable, but I still feel like I’m stuck in this mental fight-or-flight mode. It’s like I’m underwater and can’t catch a break.

Last time, the relief came quickly around the 8 week mark, and it was like flipping a switch. This time, though, I’m just not feeling that same impact. I'm feeling the sweet craving and increased social interaction but not the free from stress feeling. Is it just my body adjusting, or is there something deeper at play?

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been through a similar experience. Did you eventually find that sweet spot with Nardil again, or should I be looking deeper into what’s going on mentally or investigating other avenues. I have a low normal blood cortisol test which my psychiatrist has recommended retesting but nothing else abnormal on bloods.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey all

A few years back, while I was in a time of high anxiety (university), I developed this terrible phobia that I will hurt myself or do something impulsive. Its happens in different scenarios, like turning the car towards a car coming towards me, or jumping before a train. These scenarios, altough scary, I can manage. What totally has a grip on me is when I am in a high place- I just have this vision on me jumping. It is absolutely terrifying and I have to get myself to ground level immediately. I have no desire to die and this thought only occurs when I am already in a high place (so no pre meditation or anything). I'm fully aware this is an intrusive thought and that I don't actually want to jump, but my mind keeps challenging this notion and the anxiety persists.

I live right now in a fairly small town without tall building, and I live in a house, so I am not confronted with this too much. But right now I am visiting my home country (i relocated a few years ago), and most of my friends live in apartment buildings. I didn't realize its still so bad and I need to figure out what to do now. When I come back i'm definetly going to an anxiety specialist because I can't go on like this.

&lt;p&gt;A few years back, while I was in a time of high anxiety (university), I developed this terrible phobia that I will hurt myself or do something impulsive. Its happens in different scenarios, like turning the car towards a car coming towards me, or jumping before a train. These scenarios, altough scary, I can manage. What totally has a grip on me is when I am in a high place- I just have this vision on me jumping. It is absolutely terrifying and I have to get myself to ground level immediately. I have no desire to die and this thought only occurs when I am already in a high place (so no pre meditation or anything). I&amp;#39;m fully aware this is an intrusive thought and that I don&amp;#39;t actually want to jump, but my mind keeps challenging this notion and the anxiety persists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live right now in a fairly small town without tall building, and I live in a house, so I am not confronted with this too much. But right now I am visiting my home country (i relocated a few years ago), and most of my friends live in apartment buildings. I didn&amp;#39;t realize its still so bad and I need to figure out what to do now. When I come back i&amp;#39;m definetly going to an anxiety specialist because I can&amp;#39;t go on like this. People live and work in buildings and I can&amp;#39;t avoid this for ever. So I was wondering if anybody has has this and what kind of strategies they use.

,Anxietyhelp,"How can I improve my gut health to support mental well-being? Seeking advice on diet, supplements, and gut-brain connection.

I’ve been diagnosed with panic attacks and anxiety, and I’m currently taking B12, Lexilium (bromazepam) 6mg, and propranolol (1/4 tablet twice daily). While these treatments have been helping, I’ve been researching the connection between gut health and mental well-being and would like to improve my gut health to see if it could further support my anxiety management.

I’ve learned about the gut-brain axis, which links the gut and brain through neurotransmitters like serotonin. I’m curious about how I can make practical changes to my diet and supplements to benefit both my gut and mental health. Here’s what I’m looking for advice on:

	1.	Diet: What foods should I focus on to promote gut health? I currently eat some fermented foods (yogurt, sauerkraut), but I’m looking for more gut-friendly meal or snack ideas, especially ones that support mental well-being. Should I be focusing more on prebiotic fibers or probiotics?
	2.	Supplements: Are there specific probiotic or prebiotic supplements that you recommend? I’ve heard about strains like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium but I’m not sure what the ideal dosage or combination is, given my situation.
	3.	Gut-Brain Axis: How does this connection actually work in improving mental health? Could optimizing my gut health help with panic attacks and anxiety? If so, how long might it take to see results?
	4.	Other Recommendations: Are there other lifestyle changes I should consider (exercise, stress management techniques) to help support both my gut and mental health?

I’m really eager to improve my overall well-being and would appreciate any advice or personal experiences that could help me better understand the gut-brain connection and take steps to feel better.

,Anxietyhelp,"this strategy isnt backed by any science. just something i want to see if it works. 

my main issue here is that I often feel lonely because when I have moments of anxiety about how to become a better person every day and not revert back to old selfish habits, I often don’t have anybody to turn to. I don’t have many friends and so I research how one can develop a support system, even without having many friends 

Quora said that you should try to comment on community forums to foster that sense of community/helping and I’ve always like that even if I don’t know people personally. of course I still really want personal relationships and I’d love to have like a best friend who I can confide in, but when life is giving you an orange instead of a lemon you’re just going to have to work with that orange juice first.

it might help someone to say I still have so much self doubt in myself but every day I try to fight that voice by saying I can do it. I can see a lot of these posts here are asking for advice, but not receiving many replies, so I want to be able to comment on them because it must feel lonely having to turn into a forum instead of asking your friends or family :&lt;

&lt;p&gt;my main issue here is that I often feel lonely because when I have moments of anxiety about how to become a better person every day and not revert back to old selfish habits, I often don’t have anybody to turn to. I don’t have many friends and so I research how one can develop a support system, even without having many friends &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quora said that you should try to comment on community forums to foster that sense of community/helping and I’ve always like that even if I don’t know people personally. of course I still really want personal relationships and I’d love to have like a best friend who I can confide in, but when life is giving you an orange instead of a lemon you’re just going to have to work with that orange juice first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it might help someone to say I still have so much self doubt in myself but every day I try to fight that voice by saying I can do it. I can see a lot of these posts here are asking for advice, but not receiving many replies, so I want to be able to comment on them because it must feel lonely having to turn into a forum instead of asking your friends or family :&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this strategy might help you if applicable. It would be nice if more people could comment on each other’s posts even if we arent as big as &lt;a href=""/r/selfimprovement""&gt;r/selfimprovement&lt;/a&gt; :))&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi all, 

I am posting here really just hoping to find help with my husband and his anxiety. We both struggle with anxiety, however mine is more OCD and ritual based, whereas  his very excessive worry. It has gotten to the point where it is nearly daily panic attacks about his own health, our children's health and my health.  

He has struggled with anxiety his entire life, however it really increased with Covid and a health scare for our son from the ages of 1-2. Around this time he started Lexapro again. Once we got through that, it was about a once a month or two, he would worry he was dying. It's more recently evolved into an almost constant fear. For example, our daughter who is nearly seven is complaining of leg pain at night- he is having panic attacks she has cancer.  I have a multitude of GI issues, however I cannot discuss any of my concerns regarding my own health with him because he escalates into a panic attack. 

It is so difficult to watch your partner struggle. I try and help him through but he almost refuses to talk it through. I've tried thought stop with him, redirecting, offering alternative things to do to occupy his mind. He says his mind just won't stop, he currently meets with a therapist once a week and it has gotten worse since then. It's so incredibly heartbreaking to see and I just don't know what to do for him. I'm hoping someone here has some advice that can help. Are there any tools you might suggest ? I've even wondered if some sort of IOP might be helpful for him, but I am not sure. 

We run a business together and I worry it is causing him too much stress, on top of day to day life. Looking for anything that may help.

Earlier this year I couldn’t take it anymore so I decided to try therapy. It’s somewhat working, but I got a new job about 5-6 months ago which has really sent me spiraling mentally with second guessing myself. It’s been a really bad few months.

I don’t even know what I am anxious about, and most of the time when I do have something like a test I don’t even get anxious.

,Anxietyhelp,"I had a small ephifany on the train this morning and would be keen to hear an opinion from any physchologist or the likes.

I (52M) feel that my anxiety (emotional looping and guilt/anger feed) is increasing quite a bit lately. After  long covid I've decided visit my GP for some help. After a short stint of sertraline, I swapped to lexapro and worked my way up to feeling pretty good. So I tapered off Lexapro without any major issues.

But little did I know, a week after I was yet again anxious as a little duckie. So went back to the GP and chatted about other medication and some help. For now we settled on Brintilex (5mg), which seems to help a lot with the physical manifistations (stomach, acid reflux, sleep disturbance etc). But its eraly days. 

What it doesnt do is numb/level out my thoughts, leaving me wide open with everything (but in a less exhausting way).

  
Now coming to the odd part. I am bi-lingual. Raised in one language (Dutch) and only moved to Australia when I was 30. In the last 24 years, I find that I have to switch back to Dutch to complete complex math functions, logical algorithms and some other tasks.

This had me thinking about therapy and mindfullnes...I cannot for the life of me calm myself down in the English language. The loops just continues.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 21-year-old male and senior in college, and I could really use some support right now. Ever since my dad and stepmom left after their visit this weekend, I’ve been feeling really off out of absolutely no where. We drank together this weekend, and while I sometimes get panic attacks when I’m hungover, this time felt extremely different. I’ve been hit with this weird gut feeling of impending doom mixed with anxiety and panic that just won’t go away (I've struggled with this in the past but it has been a much different feeling).

I struggle with OCD and health anxiety, and I take 100 mg of Zoloft, but I’ve never experienced symptoms quite like this. I keep looking up my feelings nonstop, and I’m really scared it’s not just anxiety but something serious. The sense of doom is still present after a day, and when I look it up it says it can be linked to heart issues or other serious health problems, like when people have a sense that something is wrong and end up dying. I am just scared it is something like that and I am brushing it off as anxiety and telling myself it will just pass after while. I go to the doctor for yearly check-ups and everything has been fine. But then I read how people experience this feeling of doom and end up having a life threatening emergency or dying and I am so afraid thats me.

On top of all that, I wasn’t expecting to feel homesick after they left (since I am a senior in college and they have visited many times), but now everything feels heavy, and I can’t think straight, and I just don't feel like myself.

,Anxietyhelp,"There is a book of the same name, but I am focusing on the app. This is an app that basically uses mindfulness and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. It is scientific and completely legitimate. The app is created by a psychiatrist and neuroscientist. You can try it free for 30 days. It also comes with a dedicated and active community and weekly Zoom conversations. This app also includes some meditations. It's so easy to use and you'll be walked through the whole thing. Paid, it's about $30 per month.

I've had this app since July and finished the program today. To summarize, it has really helped me sit with the experience of anxiety. It gives so many tools and guides you through how to use them when you feel anxiety. You get tons of content for such a reasonable price. I'm not cured of anxiety, but really the purpose of this program is *not* to cure it. Anxiety is a fact of life, so are all negative emotions, and you cannot force yourself to make them go away. So Unwinding Anxiety helps you live with it and allow it. You learn things like noting, loving-kindness, how to detached yourself from anxiety as an identity, how to escape habit loops, that you don't actually need constant anxiety to be productive, etc.

One of the most important things about this app is the feeling of support that it gives. At my lowest moments I know that I can remember what I've learned, watch a lesson, listen to a video/meditation, or go to the community and immediately feels less alone. Even though I don't personally know Judson Brewer, I know that he understands me and in those moments I get support from him that is helpful. Instead of reacting in a way that makes my anxiety 10x worse, I can react in a way that I know is better for me based on his advice. Sometimes that advice may even be to not react at all.

&lt;p&gt;I feel like my only best years of life were til the age of 12. Because when I moved from my country to a new place. I didn&amp;#39;t know English well. I didn&amp;#39;t know the culture well and I got made fun of which seemed to cause low self esteem and quietness. Family life wasn&amp;#39;t great. Grew up in poverty and lot of arguments and conflicts which made me more quiet and serious.  I also never really tried hard for anything nor put the effort. I just lived life just to pass another day by. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi, two days ago I ate a frozen Kind bar with almonds on it. I did not notice any almonds getting stuck between my teeth. I went to bed without flossing that night because I was lazy. Last night, I flossed with my water pick and then chose to go back through with string because the batteries are dying and the pick isn’t as strong.

When flossing with the string, I knocked something out from between my two lower front teeth. I felt no pain, reached in, and pulled out what looked like a small chunk of almond.

I still feel no pain, but there seems to be a small gap between my teeth now. I’m worried of two things:

1. The almond created a gap that will not go away and might make my teeth hurt/break.
2. I actually chipped the back of my tooth and will lead to further complications.

I think my main anxiety is ending up in agonizing pain. Currently, nothing hurts and nowhere is inflamed. My roommates all looked at the piece that came out and said they were sure it was an almond and not a piece of tooth. It seems my teeth look to be normal and in tact. The only difference is the tiniest gap visible between my teeth (only visible by me) and the fact that I can feel that something is different on the back of my teeth. 

Any advice on how to calm down about this? I can’t afford a dentist appointment right now even with insurance but I’m worried that I won’t go and it’ll turn in to a bigger issue.

,Anxietyhelp,"So I've had panic attacks before and usually they are episodes of heavy breathing, sense of dread, tightness in chest. However, after an incredibly hard year filled with change (moving to a new state for a relationship, losing multiple jobs, then having relationship struggles, losing family members, starting a new job in an entirely different field, skipping a couple semesters of college so losing that routine) I'm plagued by pretty severe depersonalization/derealization and have anxious thoughts constantly, usually about life/existence/death. The depersonalization/derealization is so incredibly uncomfortable and the constant feeling fuels the anxious thoughts. My health anxiety is running rampant as I've never experienced this level of overthinking and disassociation so I'm convinced something horrible is wrong with me. I sometimes don't even have an anxiety attack, it really depends on how much my constant anxious thoughts can convince me something is seriously wrong or if I have a strong body sensation that I see that as evidence for something insidious. I listed some symptoms below, I'm just curious on if anyone's ever experienced any of this? I'm worried I'll never feel normal again. I kinda miss having specific episodes of panic attacks that had an start and an end, the constant overthinking, ruminating on existence and disassociation is awful paired with still having panic attacks every other day. I have to distract myself constantly. I'm hypervigilant and even try to catch myself having symptoms, like playing suduko and messing up a number = brain issue. Or if I get distracted by something I think to myself, why did you get distracted are you having cognitive distortions and I have to confirm that something did indeed distract me. I constantly am checking my temperature, blood pressure, and o2 which used to help but now I'm convinced whatever's ""wrong"" wouldn't show up on those readings.

* feeling like I'm in a video game, like life isn't real. Talking about it/describing it actually makes it worse.

,Anxietyhelp,"Where to start. This will be long. I hope it will make sense because it feels very disjointed to me. 

Although there were health problems before I left a previous job, I'll start there. My work visa was expiring for a job where I was totally burnt out. Just FYI, it was in healthcare. My mom, who seemed to have memory problems, was getting worse and it was obvious she is suffering from dementia. So I decided it was time to return home. This was near the end of 2022. My sibling had moved my mom to be closer to where they live, so I felt moving close to where my mom was would be the best idea to help with her care. It's a place I never would have chosen. I hate it here so it doesn't help with my mental well-being. I feel trapped. 

I had managed to secure a job before I arrived but I ended up being terminated after almost 3 months. I know my level of work performance wasn’t up to my usual standards.  Aside from significant burnout from my last job, I had endured a tremendous amount of stress making a cross border move. I had done everything on my own and it hadn’t gone smoothly. So this stress and burnout plus feeling insecure were the main contributing factors to how I did in the job. That plus huge anxiety over knowing I had to do well to keep this job. 

Adding to all of this was a health problem that cropped up two days before I was to start the job I eventually got terminated from. I’d had this issue before. It was a cardiac problem. The cardiologist that came to see me in the emergency department wanted to admit me. I guess I should have done so but I was anxious about starting my job and finding an apartment. I had less than a month to find a rental. I ended up signing myself out against medical advice. The place I am renting was one I had an appointment to see the day after my visit to the ED. Finding an apartment hadn’t been easy so from that perspective I was glad I made the appointment to see it. I was in full anxiety mode starting my job though. So it didn’t help with doing the job well. (Side note: I am grateful the cardiac issue hasn't returned.)

My belongings arrived a month after I did, my sibling didn’t once offer to help me transfer them to my apartment. I made 6 or 7 trips all on my own, packing my car as full as I could each time. Doing this all on my own wasn’t easy, especially as I had knee issues from a torn meniscus so I wasn’t exactly in the best physical shape. So another stressor. I should probably add that my sibling and I didn’t have the best relationship and it’s progressively gotten worse. 

I was pretty deflated after losing my job and was so fearful of losing another job. Realistically I just needed a break. 

But about a month after my termination I ran out of medication for an autoimmune disease I have. I ended up with the worst case of insomnia I’ve ever had! I couldn’t sleep more than 3 hours at a time despite feeling exhausted. I was finally able to see a physician and got a prescription but it took over 4 months from the time I ran out of medication to return to a semblance of normalcy. By this time I started looking for another job. I was going through my savings and as time went by I started doing what I could to minimize spending. When winter arrived, I didn’t turn on heat as most places here use electricity and not gas furnaces. At least that’s the case for apartments and condos. Fortunately I had plenty of blankets but I still slept with pants and a hoodie overtop of my pyjamas. Even so I was almost always cold. Seeing my mom meant I could be in a place that was warm. Enduring the cold of winter was horrible. And now it’s getting cold again as another year has gone by without a job. 

Around the end of 2023 my mom became sick and was admitted to the hospital nearby. I was worried about her and visited every day. She wasn’t eating much and lost a lot of weight. About a month after she was discharged she had a procedure done that required someone staying with her overnight. She doesn’t really have a place for someone else to sleep so I think I slept about an hour. This didn't bode well for my next health problem. 

Just before  the end of January I tested positive for COVID. As it turned out, I caught it from my mom who no doubt caught it from one of the staff at the seniors residence where she lives. I was angry with myself for being so foolish as to not wear a mask when I visited her. I had gone almost 4 years without getting infected. 

After COVID and her hospital stay I was spending more time with her. Trying to get her to gain some weight was next to impossible. Due to dementia there would be times when she would get angry with me over the most mundane things. This has only increased with time. I’ve left her apartment in tears many times. Saturday night was the worst. But let me back up a bit. 

Near the end of August she had a fall and ended up in the hospital again. What’s made this latest fall worse, (yes she had a previous fall), is that she doesn’t have a family doctor to go to for questions about her care. When my sibling moved her, signing up for a family doctor wasn’t done. So now she’s on a wait list. Getting a PCP is next to impossible here. 

Even though she didn’t break any bones in this fall (or previous ones), she experienced progressive pain to the point where she needed to return to the hospital. This time her dementia seemed worse and she would not eat most of her meals. I’m sure she’s lost 10 pounds. She was in the hospital for a month. I feel they discharged her too soon and her care was not as good as it was last year. I feel as if the hospital just wanted to give up on her. You see during her stay they discovered inflamed lymph nodes around her body. They suspect lymphoma. But without a biopsy they can't say for certain. Her bloodwork is largely normal and not reflective of lymphoma. But she had made it known before dementia set in that she never wanted to go through cancer treatment again. She'd had breast cancer in her 40's. When she was told about the possibility of cancer she got very upset. Thankfully dementia has meant she has forgotten that conversation. I was able to have a theoretical conversation with her about treatment. She said she wouldn't want to go through it. And the hospitalists felt that with her age and physical frailty she might not do well with treatment. They won't do a biopsy if she isn't having treatment. So no biopsy to say for sure what her situation is, they basically have just removed her from getting further care. It's as if they just feel she isn't worth their time and effort. This makes me angry and despondent. 

Without a primary care physician or even a nurse practitioner, she isn't getting ANY healthcare. (FYI, I'm in Canada.) I’m stressing about doing what’s best for her and that’s next to impossible because she’s fiercely independent and gets angry with me when I try to help. She’s constantly blaming me for things I don’t do. It is emotionally draining and very hurtful. 

To add to all of this, I still don’t have a job, a significant amount of my savings are gone, a dental issue cropped up that I can’t leave (a loose crown) but can’t afford to fix, the brake pads on my car are worn down but I can’t afford to fix them, my tires need replacing, I have absolutely no one here for support of any kind and this past week I was diagnosed with cancer.  

There is a saying that God  doesn’t give more than you can handle but I’m at my breaking point. I don’t know what to do.

About a month after she was discharged she had a procedure done that required someone staying with her overnight. She doesn’t really have a place for someone else to sleep so I think I slept about an hour. This didn&amp;#39;t bode well for my next health problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before  the end of January I tested positive for COVID. As it turned out, I caught it from my mom who no doubt caught it from one of the staff at the seniors residence where she lives. I was angry with myself for being so foolish as to not wear a mask when I visited her. I had gone almost 4 years without getting infected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After COVID and her hospital stay I was spending more time with her. Trying to get her to gain some weight was next to impossible. Due to dementia there would be times when she would get angry with me over the most mundane things. This has only increased with time. I’ve left her apartment in tears many times. Saturday night was the worst. But let me back up a bit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the end of August she had a fall and ended up in the hospital again. What’s made this latest fall worse, (yes she had a previous fall), is that she doesn’t have a family doctor to go to for questions about her care. When my sibling moved her, signing up for a family doctor wasn’t done. So now she’s on a wait list. Getting a PCP is next to impossible here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though she didn’t break any bones in this fall (or previous ones), she experienced progressive pain to the point where she needed to return to the hospital. This time her dementia seemed worse and she would not eat most of her meals. I’m sure she’s lost 10 pounds. She was in the hospital for a month. I feel they discharged her too soon and her care was not as good as it was last year. I feel as if the hospital just wanted to give up on her. You see during her stay they discovered inflamed lymph nodes around her body. They suspect lymphoma. But without a biopsy they can&amp;#39;t say for certain. Her bloodwork is largely normal and not reflective of lymphoma. But she had made it known before dementia set in that she never wanted to go through cancer treatment again. She&amp;#39;d had breast cancer in her 40&amp;#39;s. When she was told about the possibility of cancer she got very upset. Thankfully dementia has meant she has forgotten that conversation. I was able to have a theoretical conversation with her about treatment. She said she wouldn&amp;#39;t want to go through it. And the hospitalists felt that with her age and physical frailty she might not do well with treatment. They won&amp;#39;t do a biopsy if she isn&amp;#39;t having treatment. So no biopsy to say for sure what her situation is, they basically have just removed her from getting further care. It&amp;#39;s as if they just feel she isn&amp;#39;t worth their time and effort. This makes me angry and despondent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a primary care physician or even a nurse practitioner, she isn&amp;#39;t getting ANY healthcare. (FYI, I&amp;#39;m in Canada.) I’m stressing about doing what’s best for her and that’s next to impossible because she’s fiercely independent and gets angry with me when I try to help. She’s constantly blaming me for things I don’t do. It is emotionally draining and very hurtful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to all of this, I still don’t have a job, a significant amount of my savings are gone, a dental issue cropped up that I can’t leave (a loose crown) but can’t afford to fix, the brake pads on my car are worn down but I can’t afford to fix them, my tires need replacing, I have absolutely no one here for support of any kind and this past week I was diagnosed with cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a saying that God  doesn’t give more than you can handle but I’m at my breaking point. I don’t know what to do. &lt;/p&gt;

I have terrible social anxiety and don't like the way i look either, so I'm wondering if it would be illegal or something for me to use a mask on my face all the time. I wonder if i will be able to hold a job like this.

I already work as a waiter and i feel uncomfortable having to speak and show my face around, I wonder if i can be like one of them Japanese artists who use a custom mask for all of their public appearances.

And it's not just because i have social anxiety, it's because i am ugly too. I can't do anything to prevent my face from getting wrinkly or my hair falling because I'm male, I'll never be able to become a cute Femboy, so... why even bother with my face if i will become ugly? I should just cover it.

I can&amp;#39;t do anything to prevent my face from getting wrinkly or my hair falling because I&amp;#39;m male, I&amp;#39;ll never be able to become a cute Femboy, so... why even bother with my face if i will become ugly? I should just cover it.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey guys, I suffer from anxiety/depression/ADHD and well, possibly bipolar 2, and a bit of OCD. I’m kind of over all the labels tbh and doesn’t really help me. 
Lately I’ve been SO exhausted and fatigued for absolutely no reason I feel. I was low in iron, but I’ve been taking iron supplements that should have kicked in by now. I am “high functioning” and have completed 18 months of study to become a nurse, and will complete an extra 2 years but taking a break for now.

,Anxietyhelp,"Long story but here’s the gist in a short version.  My anxiety came back 6 months again and came back with a vengeance.  After suffering for 5 months with debilitating physical and mental symptoms, I had enough and went see a doctor. First one put me on Propranolol for migraines.  I took about 3/4 of the first script before the Doctor told me to get off for the side effects. I had a doctor also put me on Prozac. After about 5-6 days in Prozac, I woke up one morning and literally couldn’t think.  Couldn’t function. So my doctor told me to stop Prozac as well. This was 3 weeks ago I stopped the Prozac. I stopped the Propranolol a week later.  Since that day 3 weeks ago, I haven’t felt like myself.  I can’t concentrate, I can barely think.

,Anxietyhelp,"I can't really find much on this so I wanted to ask and see if anyone has experienced it or knows someone who has and how they managed to cope and work through it

Basically hunger makes me get really anxious and even panicky. This has been an issue for over a year and I have been eating to pre-empt it. A year+ of that has caused me to put on 100lbs.

When I feel I am ""hungry"" it strikes with an imperative of starvation. I begin to feel dizzy, I begin to feel chest/midsection pain, and am afraid I won't be able to move myself if I don't treat it somehow.

On a more positive note, I have adjusted my diet and tried small exercises and over the course of 2 months I seem have to have dropped 9lbs. But it's hard for me to really get into exercising because of fear of ""depleting"" myself and ending up in danger.

There doesn't seem to be any physical reasons for this. No notable issues on blood, and aside from one time months ago my blood sugar was 48, my blood sugar tends to be in the 90-120 range so it doesn't even seem to be hypoglycemia. (Sometimes when these episodes happen it's at 130~)

But when i am drinking, i feel so comfortable and confident, no weird physical shakes or weak knees, i feel like my self and can talk with stranger with confidence, i actually use my voice instead of mumble, my head is not full of irrational fears, im not thinking about the 10 words exchange i had with a stranger for the next three hours, i have terrible peer anxiety with my coworkers, not as much with my random older patients weirdly (i work
In healthcare)

,Anxietyhelp,"I am 28 years old. I have been suffering from heart anxiety since last year. Before these instances I was never worried or suffered from anxiety. My resting heart rate is in the mid 40s. I have bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, experience short PVCs 4-10 times a day, and random once in a blue moon SVT episodes (1-2 a month). Doctor’s notes say I have an AV block but not to worry as this is not life threatening. I’ve worn a heart monitor for 30 days, gotten an echo-diagram (ultrasound), chest X-rays, 20+ EKGs, 20+ blood test and recently done a CT scan of my heart. I have no coronary blockage and my EF is 57%. Everything comes back good and checks out but I am anxious about experiencing another episode of my heart jumping up and down while randomly enjoying my day or exercising. According to my cardiologist I am not at risk for anything right now but to check back in a year or two to keep an eye on things. I am afraid of my heart experiencing an electrical issue and dying due to sudden cardiac arrest. I am somewhat anxious of being alone and just dropping down and no one being able to help me or give me CPR. I also have GERD and esophagus issues. If I eat the wrong food it’s hell for me. This worsens my anxiety. It’s also been an issue flying on a plane or driving anywhere. The feeling is that I’m all alone and no one is going to help or I’m too far away from a hospital to get help. Id like to think I’m a tough sonabich and am naturally stoic . I don’t tell anyone my problems and keep this inside and have been dealing with this on my own. I told my parents but I played it off like it’s no big deal. They don’t know how bad my anxiety is. I am trying to find the lord again. Please pray for me as anxiety has never plagued me for this long and am asking for you and the lords help to get me through this stage in my life. Thank you for reading.

I have been suffering from heart anxiety since last year. Before these instances I was never worried or suffered from anxiety. My resting heart rate is in the mid 40s. I have bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, experience short PVCs 4-10 times a day, and random once in a blue moon SVT episodes (1-2 a month). Doctor’s notes say I have an AV block but not to worry as this is not life threatening. I’ve worn a heart monitor for 30 days, gotten an echo-diagram (ultrasound), chest X-rays, 20+ EKGs, 20+ blood test and recently done a CT scan of my heart. I have no coronary blockage and my EF is 57%. Everything comes back good and checks out but I am anxious about experiencing another episode of my heart jumping up and down while randomly enjoying my day or exercising. According to my cardiologist I am not at risk for anything right now but to check back in a year or two to keep an eye on things. I am afraid of my heart experiencing an electrical issue and dying due to sudden cardiac arrest. I am somewhat anxious of being alone and just dropping down and no one being able to help me or give me CPR. I also have GERD and esophagus issues. If I eat the wrong food it’s hell for me. This worsens my anxiety. It’s also been an issue flying on a plane or driving anywhere. The feeling is that I’m all alone and no one is going to help or I’m too far away from a hospital to get help. Id like to think I’m a tough sonabich and am naturally stoic . I don’t tell anyone my problems and keep this inside and have been dealing with this on my own. I told my parents but I played it off like it’s no big deal. They don’t know how bad my anxiety is. I am trying to find the lord again. Please pray for me as anxiety has never plagued me for this long and am asking for you and the lords help to get me through this stage in my life. Thank you for reading.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey everyone,

I’m 22F and have been battling depression for over a year now. I’ve been on antidepressants and attending therapy, which has helped in some ways, but lately, one of my biggest struggles has been oversleeping.

I can sleep up to 16 hours a day and still feel exhausted. No matter how much rest I get, I always feel drained and unable to focus, especially during my university classes. It’s making things even harder, and it’s starting to affect my mood and motivation even more. My depression feels worse because of it, and to make things tougher, my roommate has started making fun of me for how much I sleep.

My therapist says that this might be my body’s way of coping with the trauma I’ve experienced over the past few years. But even knowing that doesn’t make it any easier to deal with in my day-to-day life. I just feel stuck in this cycle of tiredness and sadness, and I don’t know what to do.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do you deal with oversleeping and the exhaustion that comes with it? Any advice or tips would be really appreciated.

So on the first weekend of November I’m going to a wedding for my cousin, where due to some really awful family drama over the past year, my mom and I are basically going to be the black sheeps.

And then there’s the election….i was awake for three days straight due to anxiety and doomscrolling in 2020 and I’m desperate to prevent that from happening, but knowing my brain I know there’s a chance I’ll fall
Back into my OCD…..
I love my mother, and I love my country, but I’m SO. FUCKING. EXHAUSTED.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi people from reddit 😊

I'm suffering right now and I would like some advice (or maybe I would just like to get this off my chest, I am not sure).
English is not my native language so I'm sorry if I make any mistakes. 

Due to a very traumatic childhood I suffer from adult seperation anxiety (as well as PTSD and general anxiety disorder). I have had so much therapy and I have been so proud of who I have become and how far I came in dealing with all the garbage that my childhood put upon me. I can honestly say it is manageable and I'm functioning without suffering all that much (now. That has been very different in the past, obviously. But I worked really hard to get here). I think I really broke the chain of childhood traumas with my own kids and I am providing them a safe and loving childhood, despite struggling myself sometimes. 
And now my partner is going away for a week (work related). We have been together for 14 years and we have two lovely daughters together, it's not like I am worried he won't want to come home to us. I know he loves us very much and he wants to be home with us. He knows all about my issues (of course he does) and we have dealt with this seperation anxiety in the past. Very regularly he leaves for a (long) weekend and I can manage that just fine. 
But tomorrow morning he will leave for a week and I feel like I am drowning.
I am so very angry at myself for being this upset AGAIN after all this therapy and EMDR and all that. I thought I dealt with the majority of my childhood traumas, but this feels like my whole world is ending. And it is just ONE WEEK for f's sake. I keep telling myself to just get over it and stop worrying, but so far that hasn't had any effect, haha. 
My man is very understanding and sweet to me, and we have a solid plan for the upcoming week with the people around us so that I won't feel alone or overwhelmed. We are truly blessed with those people who will be there for us, even if they might not understand why this is so hard on me. But I feel so much like a faillure, there are so many women who bring up their kids all by themselves. Or who's husband's have to leave for work all the time. And here I am feeling like it's the end of the world that he will be gone for a week. 
Can anyone tell me how you cope with that? I feel so much anxiety and I feel so upset with myself because I thought it wouldn't hurt this much.

,Anxietyhelp,". Very long post. 

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety since a very young teen, saw a few different pshycs and therapists growing up. My previous one i had for Like 3 years till i moved here out if state 8 months ago. 

I has to find a doc right away as i started getting bad , legs shaking, heart racing, breaking down crying non stop, couldnt relax my body down to rest. 
So i found one who had immediate openings. Primary told me after maybe 5/10min 
Im manic and bipolar- this was  2 months ago, his description was well you are not sleeping and you dont look very tired. But i told him i was exhausted and had 0 energy and was super down. 

a pshyc i finally saw a few days ago said im not bipolar but extremly anxious. The  pshyc i had for 3 years before i moved he never mentioned bipolar either. Just very severe anxiety and depression and was on paxil 40mg and valium. 

I was put on seroquel 300xr by the new primary who thinks  as i said im manic and bipolar a few months ago.  
But Now my new pshyc i just saw says im not bipolar but im having a severe depression and anxiety  and put me  on prozac 20mg.

Seroquel worked for maybe a month but i still felt on the verge of crying and breaking down daily but i was still able to kinda mask it and keep it in and take care of my son, ect.

then i started getting major health anxiety while on it. Kinda like ocd but health wise. Any little thing. Couldnt touch anything , had to wash hands multiple times before i ate. Primary said sounds like its not ocd or health anxiety and wrote me propranolol

When my primary said i was manic my symptoms were
Severe shaking, crying, having mental breakdowns, pacing back and forth, and not sleeping well as i couldnt get myself
To calm down and relax  and was very depressed. 

The propranolol helps with racing heart but not the anxiety. He then said i was out of his paygrade and not much else he could do for me. 

So thats when i drove all over and finally saw a pshyc finally a few days ago and she said she just sees severe anxiety. As i was shaking and breaking down in the office. 
Now i am on prozac 20mg, and trazadone as needed. 

I feel HORRIBLE but i dont know if it is due to not being on 300mg seroquel anymore But i started feeling horrible even on the seroquel. 
I only felt good a handful of days on it. Now i dont know if i just need to wait dor  my new med to  kicks in( even though i started feeling horrible on the seroquel which is why i found a urgent pshyc once primary said hes out of options and cant help me much anymore and i just paid out of pocket and i feel like im hopeless on getting better) or whqt.

,Anxietyhelp,"Long story short, because of trauma, if I think there’s going to be a sudden loud noise I simply can’t relax. I will feel on edge and my attention keeps flickering over in the direction where it might come from. I will distract myself but tension will creep in my stomach and it really drains my energy.

Details:
So if I hear a dog bark or a child scream once, I’ll be on edge for like half an hour wondering if it will happen again. Right now I’m living with a housemate who needs to use a machine for about 15 seconds once a day and I never know when it’s going to be. They were very kind and caring to me, but told me they were sorry but they just didn’t know when they would need to do it. So I’m constantly on edge even though I know that it wouldn’t really overwhelm me to hear it if I didn’t know it was coming. After they do it I feel like finally I can relax. 

all advice welcome, I’ve been on the lookout for a therapist who can help me with this but I’d love to hear if anyone has worked through something similar what has helped. At this point I just use noise canceling headphones (even when it’s actually quiet to prevent me from hearing the sudden sound),leave the situation, or put in earplugs to be able to relax.

,Anxietyhelp,"So hi, background is I’m 21F and I’ve suffered with debilitating panic disorder for coming up to 5 years now.

My main trigger for worse/more frequent panic attacks is being alone. I have an undiagnosed heart condition (being worked on currently) that causes me to have sudden fainting spells, dizziness, SVT runs, lotsa different horrid things that just feed into my anxiety. However about 2 weeks ago I had the worst episode I’ve ever had. 

I don’t remember it entirely, I just have the odd fleeting moment and feeling but from what my partner saw, he thought I was totally dead, said I turned deathly pale and cold, my lips and extremities were blue, and my pulse was barely there. From what I remember of it, I just felt like someone had jammed their foot into my chest and I couldn’t breathe, and I was so cold and had this horrible impending doom, I really and truly thought I was going to die. 

Like I’ve had panic attacks that have made me think I’m dying hundreds or even thousands of times, but in a way even in those moments I can fight back, like I have the strength to kind of say ‘no I refuse to die like this and I wont’. However this was different since it wasn’t my anxiety, it was very much real and I truly felt myself slipping away.

I feel like after having anxiety over having a severe cardiac episode for all these years and then finally having one has just thrown me over the edge, the one thing I’ve been living in fear of has finally came true. I can’t talk myself down from panic attacks anymore by telling myself it’s not gonna happen and I’m not gonna die, because at this point I don’t know if that’s even true. I’ve lost every ounce of fight I had left against my anxiety, and I feel truly at a loss now as to what I can possibly do to cope.

Since this bad episode I’ve been totally unable to be alone, just too scared to be without someone watching me in case I have another episode and have nobody there to get me help. It’s totally consuming my life because I can’t be with company all the time, my partner works and when he’s not around I’ve been taking myself to the hospital with how bad the panic gets, it’s unbearable. Even with the benzo’s I was given to help me at the moment, it’s like they’re a shitty band aid that really doesn’t do much to help the wound.  

I can’t continue taking myself to the hospital whenever I’m alone, it’s costing me plenty just to get there in the first place, and also it’s just not a solution at all, I feel super bad being there and using up medical resources. 

My thought is I need to find a better place to be in these moments. Somewhere I can go that has people, but not too many so it’s loud or overwhelming, but enough that there’s always at least one or two people nearby. Also it’s gotta be somewhere I could sit for a few hours and it be okay. Like I did think about going to a coffee shop or something but I can’t spend too long there really, or a library but same thing there, I don’t really know if I can sit in one all day. 

What I’m trying to say is I’d appreciate any suggestions as to where I could go to feel safe in these moments, just anywhere that I could be. If anyone has similar struggles then please, I’d love to hear your stories also. I feel so alone right now with what I’m feeling and so lost as to what to do next. Any advice or anything at all is appreciated. Thank you

Also it’s gotta be somewhere I could sit for a few hours and it be okay. Like I did think about going to a coffee shop or something but I can’t spend too long there really, or a library but same thing there, I don’t really know if I can sit in one all day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to say is I’d appreciate any suggestions as to where I could go to feel safe in these moments, just anywhere that I could be. If anyone has similar struggles then please, I’d love to hear your stories also. I feel so alone right now with what I’m feeling and so lost as to what to do next. Any advice or anything at all is appreciated. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tldr:
I have anxiety surrounding my heart condition that I’m being investigated over. My panic attacks stem from thinking I’m going to have a bad cardiac episode and die, then two weeks ago i finally had a severe cardiac episode and thought I had died. Now I’m left with the worst anxiety of my life and can’t be alone anymore without panicking. Any advice is appreciated &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"(20M) For the past few weeks i have been feeling extremely fatigued after a small 8 minute workout when i used to be able to do the same work out for an hour a couple of months ago. Ive been to many doctors and ERs they have done ekgs, ecgs, and blood test on me and every single one of them says i am healthy. My concern is that none of them want to give me a referral to get a ct scan on my chest because that is my main concern. I had a doctor listen to my lungs and say im okay and my lungs are crystal clear but i just don't believe that i am free from lung cancer. I had an episode where i was playing basketball and randomly got hit with this insane feeling of fatigue and heaviness and i had to sit out for the game ever since that game i haven't been able to work out the same. My question to the docs here would be what do you think this is and how would i go about getting a referral.

,Anxietyhelp,"Ive had anxiety issues since long as i can remember, ive taken medication in the past, Homeopathy medication to be clear, i know it might not what many people here might recommend but it helped me a lot in the past and resolved one of the biggest causes behind my anxiety, my insecurity and sense of need to be good at everything, i overcame that and had been living a good life ever since with very minimal anxiety attacks.

About a year and a half ago, i got into a relationship with this beautiful and amazing girl, someone who really understood me and we always lost sense of time whenever we talked, the only problem was she lives a damn 1800 km ago from me, and since we're both students we can not meet each other, everything was going great, but slowly i started to grow insecure, and having trust issues, mainly because of the distance, the original trigger was a fight between us involving her ex, there was nothing but i think that was the moment that triggered my trust issues. Even long after that fight everything was good but i started having anxiety about little things too, (in our relationship), we started having a bit more fights 90 percent of which were caused by my by anxiety, i wish i could explain what my anxiety feels like, its like something eating me out from the inside and i get super desperate for reassurance and seeking that reassurance in the wrong way hurt both of us, fast forward despite everything going on with my anxiety our love was only growing and we still loved each other despite the ups and down. 

It all went down last month when something happened between us, she lied to me about something involving a guy and kept on resisting until i caught her lie red handed, it went down pretty bad, and our trust was shaken. We have been having the roughest patch of our relationship and all of this is happening simultatnously as my anxiety is growing worse than ever, I am back on the same medication again and its helping but only when i dont have a real big reason for my anxiety to latch onto, yesterday something bad happened and she blocked me today, im really tired of myself and she is too, i know reading this makes me sound like an asshole maybe i really am but i swear i wouldnt be lying if i said this girl is my whole world, could never sleep knowing my anxiety has hurt the only person who ever understood me, the thought of hurting her just kills me, Im too fed up with this, if im being honest i dont know if our relationship can be saved at this point, my anxiety says no but deep down i swear all i need is another chance, and this is why im making this post, i need to learn to let go of this, let go of this constant cycle of anxiety, constant overthinking all the intrustive thought, i just want to feel like a normal person again, i know this is the only way to fight this anxiety, this is how i did it the first time, with the help of medication i slowly learnt to let go of those insecurities, it was probably easier last time cause i was the only one suffering back then, and now i have this beautiful girl with me who's also having to go through this crap just because im too damn stupid to control my feelings,

,Anxietyhelp,"I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety my entire life but in the past two weeks, i’ve noticed a complete change in myself and a drastic increase in anxiety. I’m starting to become scared for my general health. I went from perfectly fine to barely being able to sleep, eat, or function how I normally do. My family and boyfriend have noticed how I’ve been “off” and have been worried for me as well. If anyone could help me out or even just relate that would help me so much because this is significantly impacting my life and perception of myself.

My anxiety has spun completely out of control and I feel like it’s at the point where it can’t just be anxiety? I’m pretty sure my job is what started everything. A month ago I started a new job and it was going well until I started having really bad anxiety about work. My sleep has gone significantly downhill this past week because of overthinking and I probably think about work 12/24 hours a day. 

 I’ve also noticed cognitive changes in myself. I’ll be so in my own head thinking that I will drop what i’m working on and kind of go on auto pilot. I’ve noticed when people are speaking to me i’ll completely tune out involuntary and just start having mild anxious thoughts. Idk if this is anxiety but it kind of scares me. I’ve been so forgetful, “slower” than usual, and just off in general. I’m usually quick but recently i’ve just felt like i’ve been in a daze or scatterbrained. I almost feel like a zombie navigating life. I’ll start panicking over absolutely nothing and try to convince myself the world is ending over the smallest thing. I’m really self aware about how irrational my thoughts are and can calm myself down but this week it’s been near impossible. The interesting thing is, is that I was perfectly fine two weeks ago. Last week, I was accused of something I didn’t do at work and almost got fired. Ever since then my anxiety has been OFF THE CHARTS in every aspect of my life and I’ve never seen myself switch up like this before. I’m in a healthy relationship and i’ve started checking my boyfriend’s phone for no reason trying to convince myself he’s cheating on me and overthink every aspect of my relationship when I can’t sleep. This week, i’ve noticed I haven’t been able to eat as much as well and i’m pretty sure it’s because of anxiety. I’ll start eating and immediately feel nauseous. I had a rolling panic attack that lasted me an hour (normally 5-10 mins max)

I don’t feel like myself, my personality doesn’t feel like me, and there’s no way anxiety can cause this dramatic of a change? I feel like I have overthought every part of my life to the point where I don’t even know what realistic views on my life are. My boyfriend told me first thing in the morning to schedule a therapy appointment following a brutal panic attack I had and it was a wake up call. I scheduled a doctor’s appointment to get anxiety medication ASAP. I’m honestly at the point where I feel so out of it I’m not even sure medication would help. Part of me has just convinced myself that i’m stupid and can’t function like a normal person. How can someone go from fine one day, to a small thing happening, to not being able to eat or sleep?

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi everybody,

  
Recently I have been suffering from extreme stress, which kind of changes from emotional/mental to completely a physical thing. I would really like some tips on dealing with this physical stress and spiralling in overthinking. I try to listen to music sometimes, but if the beat is even a little too fast , it easily overwhelms me and kind of makes me panic more. Does anyone have any recommendations that they feel to be a huge help in getting through stress and extreme overthinking throughout the day and night? I'm open, and ready to feel more peaceful in my own mind and body. I've been seeing a counsellor linked to my place of education, but it's once every two weeks, and I think I could really benefit from talking to someone more. I've had a lot of initial sessions with therapists, but only really found a safe space in 2 out of 10 of those I'd say. Again, I'm totally open to feeling better and hopefully having this stress in my body become less overwhelming and exhausting.

,Anxietyhelp,"(This is what my mom told me. I don't remember this but there could've been more) 

 I am 2 or 3 in this story

I am at a in home daycare and the lady that was taking care of me asked my mom if she could potty train me. My mom said yeah sure because she had no problem with my older brother. (Who is 5 years older). I was a very very sensitive child. (Still am but gotten better)

Well apparently during potty training I had an accident on the kitchen floor. She got mad and locked me in the bathroom. Idk how long it was for. I also dont know how many times it could've happened. I started having night terrors about her.  I also had to know where the bathroom was at all times.. I think my brother had a feeling something bad was going on. 

My mom asked the daycare lady if she punished me for having an accident. She said yes. My mom pulled me right after she said it. 

I have struggled with anxiety, bladder issues. (Like I have to pee all the time when I'm nervous/can't hold it for long etc)  i also have ADHD and Learning disability. I also might have anxious attachment style. (Idk ive been doing research) 

It has been extremely hard. I even went to doctors to see if I had a small bladder etc. 

Also I believe around the same time I was punished is when I started having obsessions on things. (I was given a goofy doll when my cousin was born cause he needed the bottles which started my goofy obsession).  I have struggled with that all my life too and the more I think of it I think it is a comfort from what happened. Idk. 

I sometimes feel alone and that people don't understand or that I bug them with whatever im obsessed about or that I have to pee constantly. 

I am not ashamed to tell people this story. Especially since I work with young children. (I am a childcare teacher) 

Its been so hard to deal with this. My mom tells me to forgive her but it's just so hard cause of the trauma she caused...


Every time I need to be in the car or traveling for a long time I get so anxious and have to go to the bathroom (maybe an hour after we leave the house) 

I also get so anxious when we travel (we go on cruises and drive) it's always the first few days in a mess but once we get there (after a day) i am better. I have pills but I only use them as needed.

Can anxiety or chronic stress actually make you this unwell? Because at first I wasn't believing it, due to how chronic some of my symptoms are. but now I am. Like there's just no way it can cause chronic symptoms etc. It feels like to much.

And the fact my symptoms abruptly showed up when I was in the middle of getting bullied constantly, and a year after losing my dad is saying ALOT. Tbh. because before those events happened. I had no symptoms and i was 1000% perfectly fine.

But Jesus bloody christ. I never once though in my life that something like this could make you this unwell.

but I'm in denial. there's no way anxiety can make you feel so unwell CONSTANTLY.  it doesn't feel real. if anxiety was a real person me and it would be at each other's throats omg😭

,Anxietyhelp,"Honestly just looking for people who can relate.

I‘ve had few stressful events his year which have clearly taken their toll on me.

Back in June/July I started getting horrible nausea that would consume me, I would have to pace up and down the garden for hours to distract me from the feeling. I would get extremely hot and feel like I was going to pass out. This went on for a few weeks and I developed a fear of being alone. To this day I haven’t been able to spend a night alone (I used to enjoy my own company).

The nausea then turned into pressure headaches on the right side of my head, this has continued and I still have them today. I have just started seeing a chiropractor as I believe I’ve given myself TMD from always being worried and scared.

I also suffer with sharp stabbing pains in my head which only last a few seconds but send me into panic when I have them. Some days I can experience 5+ panic attacks which is draining beyond words. I am unable to sleep at night as I have developed a fear of sleeping as well.

I am booked in for a mri for the headaches but the doctor has said it’s more for my comfort and relief as she doesn’t believe there is anything beyond anxiety.

My left hand shakes constantly and gets worse doing the simplest activities such as showering or even just standing up and then my right hand then shakes along with this.

Occasionally I experience eye problems, it’s like theres something in my eye and makes it go blurry in a spot, or sometimes it’s like my eyes can’t focus on words.

I feel weak and dizzy all the time which is probably just down to me being in constant fear. I have had blood test that all came back clear but my brain will not let me believe that it’s not something more than anxiety.

I experienced my first panic attack in my sleep the other night which was the worse one I’ve ever had and my heart rate was the highest it’s ever been.

I have tried fluxotine but I only lasted on them 3 days as on the 3rd I experienced a 24 hour panic attack And obviously medication like this makes you worse before you get better but the thought of being worse than this I can’t face.

I am currently awaiting CBT therapy but I have been on the waiting list for months.

It seemed to have subsided for 2-3 hours. Now we’re about to do some sight seeing and I can’t shake this ill feeling, and not sure if it’s anxiety or I’m actually coming down with something.

She won’t even eat unless someone feeds her, won’t shower unless reminded, and has no clue how to do laundry or clean up after herself.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi all. Sorry if my thoughts are disorganized. I’m having trouble focusing so I’m a little all over the place right now.

I recently started seeing a psychiatrist again because my anxiety has reached the point where I’ve had to seriously consider quitting my job. I work 9 hours Monday through Friday and I’m so severely anxious in that time frame that it’s unbearable. I’ve been around the block trying medication already. Here’s a summary, which you can easily skip:

I’ve tried several antidepressants and ended up in a mental hospital because one increase my SI. I won’t take SSRIs or SNRIs anymore. Now she’s got me on Trintellix, which I’m willing to give a shot. If that doesn’t work, the next step is Lithium and I think that’s at the bottom of the list.

I’ve tried hydroxyzine. It helps, but I can’t take it regularly because of how drowsy it makes me. I’ve done Buspar, but it makes me so lethargic and dizzy that I can’t stand up, so we’ve moved on from that. Now I’m on benzodiazepines to hold me over until the antidepressant starts working, but I think I’m having adverse side effects to those too.

My psych said that she thinks once the antidepressant kicks in, my anxiety will be more manageable and I won’t need anything for it regularly. I don’t think that will be the case. Has anyone ever experienced that? I don’t think my anxiety stems from depression. I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 13 because I’ve always been a very anxious, on edge person. I was only diagnosed with depression when I was 18 because I was getting a psych eval for other reasons. My symptoms aren’t that prominent (they rank moderate) and I’m not very worried about them.

So my big question is: what if medication fails? I’ve done therapy work, but I don’t think that alone will be enough. I’ve looked into the potential for a service dog and I’d like to bring it up to my psychiatrist, but I’m not sure. I just don’t know what to do when we’re starting to run out of options.

I started taking Prozac in June and I truly feel like without this I would not be where I am today. I have a job at an elementary school, go out with my friends, and I’m finally dating again!!! I feel just so werid knowing people can live life with no anxiety anymore. It was a werid feeling and I am still waiting for the other shoe to drop. I just wanted to say if you are truly struggling to where life sucks and your everyday is just so bad, you should try medication❤️&lt;/p&gt;

I've had this weird fantasy for a long time of finding a way to pair up w another individual w social anxiety to help support one another to conquer fears together.

For example--if participating at a volunteer event causes feelings of social anxiety, you and your SA buddy would go to an event together for support and encouragement to get through it together. Sort of like--doing exposure therapy together but w another person who ""gets it"". Rinse and repeat.

Curious what peoples thoughts are about this? I'm interested in doing this but no idea how. Like would I go on bumble bff and seek out an ""anxiety buddy""? lol

,Anxietyhelp,"Honestly just looking for people who can relate.

I‘ve had few stressful events his year which have clearly taken their toll on me.

Back in June/July I started getting horrible nausea that would consume me, I would have to pace up and down the garden for hours to distract me from the feeling. I would get extremely hot and feel like I was going to pass out. This went on for a few weeks and I developed a fear of being alone. To this day I haven’t been able to spend a night alone (I used to enjoy my own company).

The nausea then turned into pressure headaches on the right side of my head, this has continued and I still have them today. I have just started seeing a chiropractor as I believe I’ve given myself TMD from always being worried and scared. I think is helping as after 2 session the pressure seems to have eased up a bit but I left with horrible stabbing pains. I also getting pain in front of and behind my ear sometimes above along with clicking/popping ears.

I also suffer with sharp stabbing pains in my head which only last a few seconds but send me into panic when I have them. Some days I can experience 5+ panic attacks which is draining beyond words. I am unable to sleep at night as I have developed a fear of sleeping as well.

I am booked in for a mri for the headaches but the doctor has said it’s more for my comfort and relief as she doesn’t believe there is anything beyond anxiety.

My left hand shakes constantly and gets worse doing the simplest activities such as showering or even just standing up and then my right hand then shakes along with this.

Occasionally I experience eye problems, it’s like theres something in my eye and makes it go blurry in a spot, or sometimes it’s like my eyes can’t focus on words.

I feel weak and dizzy all the time which is probably just down to me being in constant fear. I have had blood test that all came back clear but my brain will not let me believe that it’s not something more than anxiety.

I experienced my first panic attack in my sleep the other night which was the worse one I’ve ever had and my heart rate was the highest it’s ever been.

I have tried fluxotine but I only lasted on them 3 days as on the 3rd I experienced a 24 hour panic attack And obviously medication like this makes you worse before you get better but the thought of being worse than this I can’t face.

I am currently awaiting CBT therapy but I have been on the waiting list for months.

Recently, about 2 weeks ago or more I started having the worst anxiety attacks daily, I feel like my teenager self again and as much effort as I put into it I cannot talk myself down from these attacks nor the daily anxiety I get now wondering when these attacks will hit me. It’s ruining me, I’m a full time student and healthcare worker and cannot function anymore with this happening. My biggest anxiety symptom is nausea and as soon as these attacks hit me I immediately feel like I have to throw up and I’m really only at home really when I’m done for the day and ready to sleep since I have a busy schedule so I am out in class, work, commuting most of the time when this happens and it’s terrible. This is the first time this has ever happened to me- like a reoccurrence of my severe anxiety since I have managed it well and it feels like it has attacked me out of nowhere and now I cannot get rid of it I need to know if anyone has gone through this, why this happens and what I can possibly do please.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"So I’m a 30F with a severe social anxiety and depression. For the past sixth months I’ve been feeling like crap because I’m trying to find a job and it’s just terrifying. Let’s just say that I was kind of a hermit for a really long time, but real life is catching up to me and I can’t afford to keep hiding. But just the thought of having a job and facing people freaks me out, therapy is not helping anymore and I can’t make any decisions about a job because I feel terrified. Yesterday I even hyperventilated and I feel nauseous all the damn time. I feel like I can’t deal with my emotions and body sensations right now, they’re seriously drowning me and that makes impossible concentrating in finding a job. 

So I think I need meds that can support me while staring this challenging next step in my life. A couple of years ago they gave me Zoloft and then Prozac. They only helped me with my depression, but not with the anxiety, I didn’t have a lot of progress and stopped taking them. I think that this time I need benzodiazepines (I’ve read they’re really good for serious anxiety in a short term) and after talking with an uncle who’s a doctor, he offered to prescribe them to me. It’s just that I want to be very careful with this stuff because I’m aware of dependency, withdrawal, etc. 

I just want to ask if taking small dosages is still okay? Is it true that you don’t have to take them daily? Is there a way to avoid going through withdrawal? I would like to take them alternating days, but I don’t know if that would make them lose their efficacy like it happens with SSRIs. I would prefer to avoid taking them daily, so I won’t become dependent of them. I just need them in a short term, while I try to put my life back in order. I just feel really scared of having to face people again after being stuck at home on my own for a really long time :( Worst decision of my life tbh. I became way too comfortable and now the last thing I want to do is go out. 

Anyway, I will talk with my uncle/doctor about this too, it’s just I would also like to know about the experiences of people who have actually taken them. Besides, although my uncle is a doctor, unfortunately he’s not an actual psychiatrist, so I guess his knowledge will be a little limited.

,Anxietyhelp,"It's about 5:30am local here. Normally I would be waking up to start getting ready for work in 45 minutes or so, but I haven't been able to sleep.

Yesterday morning I was on my drive into work. I had just merged onto the freeway and gotten my car up to speed when I saw someone on foot, yards ahead of me, go darting from the shoulder on the right-hand side of the freeway out in front of the pickup truck directly in front of me. The truck didn't have time to even brake and it struck the man, sending him airborne. His body was sent so far into the air that the front of my car passed underneath of him as he was falling back down onto the shoulder to the right of the road.

I stopped, immediately, along with the pickup truck involved in the incident, and several other cars that pulled over. I ran back to the man who had been struck. I don't want to describe what I saw, but it was immediately clear from seeing his body that he had not survived the impact. The man who had been driving the truck was bordering on hysterically upset, and I tried to help the other drivers attempt to calm him.

The authorities were called and arrived. The police diverted traffic away as the paramedics covered the body with a blanket. The police asked me to give them my information and a witness statement, which I gave, and then I went on to my office.

I got to my desk without speaking to anyone in the office, and sat there blankly for probably a half an hour without being able to do anything as I sat, starting processing what I had seen. I could feel my chest start to pound, and I ended up running to the bathroom to vomit. After that I went and found my boss and told her what happened on my drive in, interrupting the short conversation with another run to the bathroom to vomit again, and I was sent home from work for the day.

I couldn't figure out what to do when I got home. I sat, mostly. My chest didn't stop  pounding. It still hasn't stopped. And my heart feels like it's beating somewhere up near my throat. I had my TV on for a while but I couldn't stop my mind from jumping back to what I had seen yesterday morning.

It's been almost 22 hours since my drive into work yesterday, and I haven't come anywhere near to being able to fall asleep. I emailed work an hour ago to let them know that I won't be coming in today.

I haven't ever suffered from anxiety attacks, or any kind of anxiety, really. This all feels completely foreign to me. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do to calm myself down.

,Anxietyhelp,"(Trigger warning: c word disease, blood mentioned)
I’ve made a few posts about my health anxiety before. What been going on has been the hardest thing I’ve dealt with in my life. For the past twoish years of and on I’ve convinced myself I have had some kind of gi c***** and I think it’s finally coming to an end!

For the past year I became obsessed with analyzing my stool for blood. It got to the point where I would think everything I saw was blood (it wasn’t). This turned into so many physical symptoms it’s unimaginable. I’ve wasted so much time and energy on this, caused strain in relationships, caused unhealthy habits, and bad hygiene. 

For the past 8-10 days I have not checked my stool even a little, I flush before I stand up and when wiping I close my eyes and then check the wipe when I have wiped enough to know there’s no chance there will be any fecal matter on the wipe for me to over analyze. This alone has decreased my physical symptoms by probably around 80%. The other 20% are just normal sensations and feelings a healthy human has. 

Not analyzing has allowed my symptoms to dramatically reduce, that in combination with doctors telling me I’m healthy is putting this self diagnosis to rest and I couldn’t be happier. Yes I still have times throughout the day where I think there’s still something wrong with me but I’m probably 75% better than I have been in months. 

I’m so proud of myself for overcoming what I thought was impossible. You can too, there is a light at the end of this very dark and scary tunnel of hell. 

I feel that confirmation bias isn’t talked about enough in the anxiety community. (Confirmation bias: the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories.) I’ve found that if you analyze enough with the belief that something is wrong, you will without a doubt start seeing evidence to reenforce your belief. For me I believed I had gi c*****, I analyzed my stool to the point that I was perceiving things that weren’t blood as blood. 

If you are analyzing anything whether it’s blood pressure, weight, temperature, physical symptoms, etc. stop this now! This without a doubt will help you. It will be hard and it won’t help over night, but it will help.

 Im finding im addicted to my phone, energy too low after work to do much else but...im getting off topic. Due to childhood poverty, I think im constantly trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. Every couple months I switch to having a new ideal profession(usually I cycle through the same ones lol), and do all the research to try and figure out what i need to do to reeducate myself/ retrain etc. I end up being down on it, and realising its not for me, or being overwhelmef by choice decided I'll wait and see how I feel about it. I always end up giving up on the idea, at least temporarily. I feel like this is somehow related to my anxiety...a friend recently suggested i might have adhd.

 Im finding im addicted to my phone, energy too low after work to do much else but...im getting off topic. Due to childhood poverty, I think im constantly trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. Every couple months I switch to having a new ideal profession(usually I cycle through the same ones lol), and do all the research to try and figure out what i need to do to reeducate myself/ retrain etc. I end up being down on it, and realising its not for me, or being overwhelmef by choice decided I&amp;#39;ll wait and see how I feel about it. I always end up giving up on the idea, at least temporarily. I feel like this is somehow related to my anxiety...a friend recently suggested i might have adhd. Have any of you experienced anything similar with idealistic escapist fantasies of other careers that prevent you from actually moving forward in life? I feel like this is such weird problem to have. I already have a bfa which is part of being hesitant to move forward on anything&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi, brand new redditor here. I decided I needed to ask peoples opinion since I can't really trust my own, and I'd like to know if I'm off base on this. (Potential trigger warning: mentions of allergic reaction) 

A month ago I was on a road trip with my family, and while on a drive I drank an ice cold (and I mean COLD) protein shake that I had never tried before. About 5 minutes into drinking it, I experienced a throat spasm. I was convinced I was dying because my throat completely closed up, and it sent me into my first ever panic attack. I couldn't breathe for what felt like forever, not knowing what was happening and convinced I was in anaphylactic shock and dying. I begged my mother to call an ambulance. I ended up being able to breathe well enough to get driven to the ER, where they told me what had really happened. 

All was fine after this incident until 2 weeks ago, when I guess the mental scars from that day finally sunk in. I had my second ever severe panic attack out of the blue one night after waking up at around 2am. Ever since then I've been experiencing panic attacks, as well as general anxiety on a daily basis, and have even started experiencing my first ever episodes of depersonalization as of 4 days ago. 

I've also noticed that since this incident occurred, I've been scared to try any kind of new food in fear I may be allergic, and am scared to eat or drink anything cold. I also believe I have developed health anxiety, as the other day I was stung by an ant, and I was convinced for a solid 20 minutes I was going to have a severe allergic reaction, and was so anxious even though it barely even hurt.

Is what I'm experiencing a trauma response? Will I ever get over this? I haven't been able to speak to a counselor yet, but I know that ever since that day I haven't been the same.

,Anxietyhelp,"I am a 21 year old male. I recently went to my doctor and was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). I told him about the physiological symptoms I’d been experiencing that I thought were caused by anxiety. My suspicion was confirmed.

I had been struggling with high blood pressure, and a multitude of other symptoms. He told me that I was young and healthy, and that my blood pressure would inevitably go down if I could lower my stress levels.

Despite this, I can’t shake this sense of impending doom, and the feeling that I am going to parish due to an undiagnosed terminal illness. I have a history of panic attacks, heart palpitations, breathing difficulties, gastrointestinal problems, and dizziness.

My doctor recommended a therapist. I’ve been meaning to call and make an appointment with one. But, I can’t even work up the courage to make a simple phone call due to social anxiety. I feel worthless.

I lack the energy and motivation to improve my physical health. I have meaning to establish a workout routine, but due to the aforementioned problems, even that is a drag.

,Anxietyhelp,I had my first panic attack about 2 months ago randomly while driving. Since then I have developed bad anxiety especially while driving. I am trying to break this cycle because most of my days are spent driving. There’s been weeks where I have controlled it and all of a sudden one day it hits me hard and I have no idea why. I know the cause of my anxiety is thinking of anxiety. Is medication a route to break the cycle? If so does anyone have any personal experiences getting back to “normal” by using medication and breaking the cycle. I just want to feel myself again and would like some advice.

,Anxietyhelp,"I (F/33) work as a stagehand from time to time. I’ve done several gigs this year but I am not very experienced and usually wait for proper instructions before handling something I’m not familiar with. Once I know how to work something, I work very diligently. I really need some money so I took a gig scheduled today that has me working 9am-2pm then I go back again at 9:30pm-1:30am. I am feeling so much anxiety right now before the second shift starts because of a supervisor who kept berating me earlier today. He looked and talked to me as if I am the most useless person in the word and I tried not to take it to heart but as I have anxiety, it really bothered me. I did well with other supervisors but when I work with him, I can just feel the hostility. Once he even said “you don’t do much do you? You just stand around watching everyone work” and that really hurt me but I just continued with what I was doing without saying anything.

TW- Sexual topics 

 I am feeling extreme guilt due to a certain situation which has caused my ocd and depression to relapse. I’m struggling to get out of bed, partake in my interests, i have a really low appetite. I’m also feeling extremely suicidal, i wish i didn’t feel this way. It feels like if im a bad person, i don’t deserve to be alive.

Basically, I used to know this girl in school, we were kinda friends? Never really liked each other, but kinda acquaintances. I didn’t really like her for a few reasons, firstly she kept getting with obviously toxic men and then she cried when they hurt her. I also felt she was a pick me, constantly talking about “the boys” And a plethora of reasons and i just felt she was sometimes kinda bitchy and rude. 

I need to clarify i didn’t dislike her for this and i felt bad for her when this happened. I saw her crying really upset because her now ex SA’d her. And i knew this ex and i used to like him, i didn’t know why they broke up and i rarely messaged. But after i found out, i avoided him but i saw him at the mall. I blew him off and was rude to him and then the friend i was with was curious why i didn’t like him so i told my friend. I realize now it wasn’t my info to share and i feel very guilty for sharing that. I also told my friend to take it with a grain of salt because i didn’t know if i fully believed her. I realize now that was so fucked up of me, especially since i’ve been sa’d before too. 

I also once heard her snitching on one of her friends to the teacher for “talking bad about the boys” and i hated this close friend of hers, so i told her friend so it ended their friendship because i felt very bitter at the time and had a lot of repressed anger towards her friend. I realize i was being petty and toxic and feel a lot of guilt for it. But i don’t she knows i did this

Lastly, the thing i’m most worried about is that im bi which is relevant. She is extremely pretty, but i never really have had a crush on her. But sometimes she would wear tops that showed a lot of cleavage. i sometimes would notice it, then realized i was looking and try to look away. then become obsessed with not looking which ended up in me only looking more. she seemed to never notice it and i feel really bad if i ever made her uncomfortable. 

This goes to now, I went to haunted house with my friend and she was a scare actor and we had a never small conversation, and i ofc am now worried i was staring at her boobs. she didn’t seem very upset with me  when we talked but i messaged her “hey! it was nice seeing you again! this is

,Anxietyhelp,"hey, i hope this isn't violating rule 2, i'm just curious as to whether any of u have experienced something similar and if that could mean i have anxiety. i don't consider myself a particularly anxious person- i'm pretty laid back, i don't tend to overthink things, i've only had a panic attack once and that was when i learnt i was afraid of heights while 40 foot in the air so idk if that counts lol

anyway, despite this, as far back as i can remember i get really afraid and paranoid on a regular basis- only of silly, irrational things like 'what if there's a creature at the foot of my bed and it's gonna jump out and eat me' but mann even though i know it's silly the fear is VERY real. it doesn't tend to affect my life too much bc it only happens when i'm alone so i've never actually talked to anyone about it but uh. lemme give some examples of how it does affect me:

- i can't really use VR headsets; i play beatsaber basically every day, but i have to pause midway through each song and take the headset off to look around bc i get a really strong sense that i'm vulnerable/being watched

- if i'm alone after midnight i literally get so afraid i can't move, it can take upwards of half an hour for me to hype myself up enough to move

- i can't handle the dark like. at all. every time i turn off my lights to go to sleep i literally jump into bed and hide under the covers, this even applies sometimes when i'm with other people. this means i sleep with a nightlight or with my door open usually, which wouldn't be a big deal if i was a child but i'm 16 going on 17

- i run around my house (through the halls, up and down the stairs) bc i feel vulnerable when i'm not in a closed room or sat down somewhere- this is also often triggered bc i think i see something out of the corner of my eye

- sometimes when i'm trying to fall asleep i get really vivid disturbing images flashing in my head and it's enough to keep me up on my phone for hours, otherwise i get too freaked out- this also means i can never fall asleep after waking up from a nightmare but i figure that's a little more normal

- on the phone topic, if i'm alone in a room and i don't have any devices that can access the internet to hand i get freaked out bc again. really can't handle being alone. sometimes when i'm walking on my own i have to text/call my friends or i freak out

  
when i'm typing this all out i sound like a crazy person and it seems kind of obvious that something's wrong, but honestly other than when i'm actively feeling the fear i don't think abt it? idk, i've never really talked about it and when it happens when i'm around other people i'm relatively good at hiding it. also now that i think about it i get really bad intrusive thoughts which may also link into this. so, people with anxiety, does this sound like ur experience at all? should i go to the doctors about this or do i just need to get over myself lol",t2_1awztgp8ox,False,,0,False,"wondering if anyone with anxiety has had similar experiences to me (as far as i know, i don't have anxiety)",[],r/Anxietyhelp,False,,,0,,,False,t3_1g4gu6c,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Need Advice,False,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1729022314.0,text,,,,text,self.Anxietyhelp,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hey, i hope this isn&amp;#39;t violating rule 2, i&amp;#39;m just curious as to whether any of u have experienced something similar and if that could mean i have anxiety. i don&amp;#39;t consider myself a particularly anxious person- i&amp;#39;m pretty laid back, i don&amp;#39;t tend to overthink things, i&amp;#39;ve only had a panic attack once and that was when i learnt i was afraid of heights while 40 foot in the air so idk if that counts lol&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey guys, I am 37F.  I have had pretty bad anxiety my entire life or for as long as I can remember.  I have had quite a few jobs over my life but my anxiety always seems to get the best of me.  I have my BA in Business Administration and my MBA.  

I have had such a hard time getting jobs over the years because I just struggled hard to not get overly anxious in my interviews.  The times I have gotten through and got hired ended up not working out because even though I knew the content and could do the job, my anxiety just kept me from remaining calm so I would rush through and make mistakes.  I have been let go from several because they said that I wasn't catching on quickly enough.  It never really was that.  It was just the constant mistakes bc no matter what I did I just couldnt settle down enough so in turn made mistakes.

I finally have a good job with the ability to move up within the company because of growth opportunities but I again am falling back to what I am so ""good"" at and thats panicking.  My boss will be sitting with me and I will be doing the most basic stuff like setting up a meeting in outlook.  I know how to do this but I just went so fast that I didnt even set up the meeting.

Not only that but the company that I work for and my position is sending out billing to major companies for repairing elevators/escalators at their job.  So making mistakes although happens but shouldn't be done just because I have an internal panic and go too fast and dont cover my basis.  This could cause us to not get paid for the repair.  Some of these bills that I am billing for are 100k+.  The less mistakes the better.  But I don't know how to get past my head and my anxiety.  

Any advice

,Anxietyhelp,"This will probably be my last post on Reddit — any advice would be hugely appreciated.

**TLDR: If you had to pick between long term use of SSRI's or benzos for OCD/anxiety — what would you do?** 

My story: 

I was on an antidepressant/SSRI for years (for OCD) which, in conjunction with therapy, worked pretty well. I decided to stop my SSRI two months ago, thinking I didn't need it anymore. Big mistake. A month later I started noticing really intense depressive symptoms, then came the crippling anxiety, the likes I've never had before, followed by daily panic attacks and, finally, the return of the king: OCD with extreme magical thinking.

Few weeks ago, I spoke to my psychiatrist over the phone (at this point I can't really go outside). She suggested I go back on my SSRI, and she also prescribed me benzos for short-term relief. 

I've been taking the benzos ever since but have yet to reinstate the SSRI. I'm just beyond terrified about potential side-effects from reinstating, there's just too many horror stories out there and I just can't bring myself to take that first pill. 

The thing is: so far the benzos *have* helped. Not really with the OCD/magical thinking but 100% with the anxiety associated with it. I feel like I can sort of function whilst on them. On the flipside, I noticed that around 36 hours after dosing, I would get extreme rebound anxiety and even some bad physical symptoms so I've definitely developed a dependency of some sort even taking them “just” for 2-3 weeks.

So... what are my options here? Every single doctor I've spoke to wants me back on the SSRI, and dismisses my concerns out of hand (except my therapist — the only one who understands my fears, but still thinks it'd be better for me if I went back on it). 

As I see it, I can either: 

1. Reinstate the SSRI and see if it works out despite my extreme fear of side effects 

2. Continue taking benzos daily indefinitely 

I know there's people out there who've been taking benzos daily for years, so I know for a fact it's possible. Obviously I realise how horrible going off them would be, but at least for now I've taken benzos and I've seen they kind of work, without any major side effects. Reinstating my antidepressant is an unknown at this point. It might work, it might not. Can I risk it? I don't know. 

What would you do in my position?

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi long time suffer of anxiety and panic attacks. I haven’t been to the dentist in over 10 years. Last time I went when I was a child and I had a bad experience due to mental health i have neglected my teeth 
I probably need about 6 or 7 fillings ranging in bad to Minor. I am so afraid of the dentist the thought is kept me awake for weeks. I’m dreaming about it. I’m panicking every day. I’m making my teeth worse trying to make up for years of neglect. I know I must go to the dentist now. I’m going to go next week for an emergency appointment.

So I’m traveling from the us to the Philippines next month, and I don’t love flying… A two hour flight it’s already a lot for me, so one over 15 hrs is making my anxiety worse. 

I don’t have any prescriptions and I’m not under any kind of treatment, I try to manage my anxiety with breathing and other activities. 

Someone mentioned this gummies but I’m not sure where to buy, which one, if they actually help, etc etc. 

Weed hadn’t been also a good idea, doesn’t give me the effect I want. 

Any suggestions or experiences??

After I finished showering, she gave me water, and I drank it. She checked my blood pressure, and it was a bit high. I felt so hyper aware that I told her to call 911, and she did.

I have generalized anxiety. I’m 43 and I’ve had it for as long as I can remember. It got real bad several years ago and I was put on Effexor. It saved my life. 


Two months ago I was attacked by a dog requiring reconstructive surgeries. I am a bartender and returned to work tonight. I still need one possibly two more surgeries. The injuries to my face are obvious. 


I can’t afford to not work. My anxiety makes it hard to breathe. I have a Valium prescription as well as medical thc gummies but I can’t drive using them.


I haven’t tried any thc alternatives. Are any of them worth trying? I need advice and suggestions. I take 150 mg of Effexor daily if that helps. Thank you so much!

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to share this on here for some positivity. Sometimes it’s just little things that mean the world to people and I’m going to do my best to help everyone who’ll allow me. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Good evening everyone, 

I'm 23, soon to be 24, fresh out of college and ready to enter the working world. So far, everything's going pretty well in my life. 

Well, everything, except for a few details. I've been on antidepressants for 4 years because of a major burn-out/depression. So, 4 years ago, I was unable to get out of bed, eat or interact with others. I didn't quite understand what was happening to me. 

I'll try to be brief about it, but my depression takes the form of major sleep problems: difficulty falling asleep in the evening and bouts of fatigue in the early afternoon. Something that has often troubled me is that these sleep and anxiety problems were already manifesting themselves in a minor way when I was working out (I don't do it any more, as it tires me out too much). Perhaps this activity is also considered stressful by my brain, go figure. 

It was also 4 years ago that I experienced my biggest hypochondria attack. My anxiety manifested itself (to this day) as severe hypochondria. At that time, I thought I had every disease in the world: I went from Covid, to STDs (including AIDS), to lung, throat, stomach and brain cancers, and finally neurological diseases (Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis). That year, I went to the emergency room 4 times, visited a lung specialist, an ENT specialist, 3 doctors, had a PET scan, a chest X-ray, blood tests and a brain MRI. I must have looked like a very sick person, frankly. The most impressive thing was that I was able to create symptoms. 

I think I have a brain tumor? The next day I have a headache. 
I think I've got lung cancer? I have trouble breathing immediately. 
I think I have throat cancer? I have a sore throat the next few days. 

4 years ago, when I went to the doctor, I saw a poster about multiple sclerosis. Out of curiosity, I used my phone to find out more about the disease. Terrible mistake. That was the day my obsession with the disease began. I can't remember exactly what symptoms I was inventing for myself at the time, but I do know that it panicked me to the point of having a brain MRI. 

Finally, one fine day I let go of this obsession. Then, for 4 years, I tried out various antidepressants, all of which had some effect, as my condition was much better than it was 4 years ago. 
Nevertheless, these thoughts never really left me. Even when I was feeling relatively well, there was always a part of me that thought, ""What if I had [insert any serious illness]? 

In the meantime, I've been diagnosed with ADHD. I'm currently taking a treatment that helps me work. At the same time, this treatment makes me a little more anxious (it's a side effect). 

I took a competitive examination 1 month ago. Since the end of the written exam, I've had the impression that something wasn't quite right. If I had to analyze what's happening to me coldly, I'd simply say that I've had a bout of anxiety and fatigue.
But here's the thing. As it happens, I have certain neurosymptoms: spasms (since I've been taking antidepressants), a painless ""muscle-cracking"" sensation when I'm tired (again linked to my taking antidepressants), and I may have felt some tingling and a sort of little pressure on the tip of my thumb a few days ago. Once again, to analyse the situation coldly, I'm currently on the move with my treatments and I know that this could be a reason for certain symptoms.

But that's all I needed: in the last few days, my obsession with multiple sclerosis has returned. I'm on the lookout for the slightest abnormal sensation on my body. 

What's more, since the tingling and sensation on my thumb were on my right side, I'm obsessed with my right side. As a result, I seem to feel abnormal things only on my right side. 

Besides, the part of the brain that controls the right side of the body is the left side, isn't it? So there you go, feeling ""pain"" on the left side of your skull! 

Anyway, you see where I'm going with this, it's all just hopeless. These thoughts occupy my days and I'm unable to do anything.
I've been through this once before and still I can't fight my hypochondria. 
I don't understand why I relapse. I don't understand why my psyche is able to fake symptoms. What's seriously wrong with me? 

Where it gets complicated is when the fake symptoms mix with the real ones. I feel like I'm going crazy. Or maybe I already am? 

Thanks to those who have read this. 
If anyone has any advice for me, I'd love it. Unfortunately, it seems to me that you're the best ones to analyze this situation coldly. 

Have a nice day/evening!

,Anxietyhelp,"I will try to be brief because it is a long story.

I for many years have been on a stabilizing course of Sertraline with Ativan as needed but I have been very careful with the Ativan due to its addictive nature. Earlier this year I was treated for Viral Meningitis after two days of 105 fever. In the ER I was given the max dose of Morphine and a course of Dilantin. I had a spinal tap and everything which wasn't fun. I was then given an antiviral and antibiotics and sent home. When I got home my whole body was shaking, I wanted to run but couldn't get anywhere because I wanted to escape being me, feeling the way I was feeling. This was probably my bodies reaction to all the meds, mixed in with a panic attack. For the next \~3 days my legs and arms could not stop shaking, almost continuously. While the panic was gone my body was still healing. 

Since then I have seen my mental health deteriorate to the point that I ended up in the ER again last Friday. I had been having what I/doctors believe were ongoing panic attacks and overwhelming anxiety for nearly a month prior. After some Propananol to slow my heart rate, and a big dose of Ativan I was tired but under control. I felt the aftereffects of the Ativan for a day after my visit, but then the Anxiety and Panic that I have been accustomed to over the last month returned. 

I am being told that I am ""Doing everything right"" I have been seeing a therapist for months now, I am seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow, and am in constant contact with my GP. While I have struggled with Anxiety and Depression in the past, why am I unable to get out of this now? Any thoughts on why it has gotten so incontrollable?

Im so lost at this point and i cant keep lying to myself. 
Since my school days ive had trouble voicing my thoughts out loud. When we would be talking about any topic (academic or social) and all the class is contributing… except me. 
I hate it.
I always get self conscious and cant actually “push out” my thoughts. 
And when i dont participate i feel shitty and feel like an outsider and it makes the next time even harder to say anything cuz i feel like the words i say are gonna be scrutinized further because i dont talk much(as opposed to those super social people that can say dumb shit them rebound because they always contribute)
And in a way i fall deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole. Every time i tell myself next time its gonna be different, but it never does.
Literally every day every ttime before i go to school (now uni) i saw today is gonna be different and then i go back home defeated.

I school it wasnt that big of a deal because i didnt have much of a reputation to maintain, and talking in classes wouldnt necessarily benefit me. But now in uni i needdd to talk i needdd the professors to like me. I cant afford bad grades and if you dont have a good connection with your profs its harder to ace the class… also no one wants to talk and socialize with the uncool loner. 
Its funny… ive worked so hard on myself but in all the wrong ways. I got jacked and tall and kinda upgraded my look. But looks can only get you so far.


I cant even ask a question in class. Ive never asked a question in class. And my fumbass says ohhhh i cant start now it would be weird.

Even online since we have some online classes now. Its as bad. Its funny i tried joining discord to try to talk to random people anonymously but even thissss makes me nervous. When no one can ever possibly know who i am. Its crazy

Im at a loss and i consider this my first public cry for help. Any advice please. Im down for anything

,Anxietyhelp,"Deja Vu and health anxiety. 

DISCLAIMER. I AM SEEING A NEUROLOGIST AND AM NOT LOOKING FOR A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS. 

Hello everyone. I hope you all are doing well. I wanted to post on here because I'm having a bit of a mental health struggle. So for context

In October I was getting vertigo and other weird brain zaps symptoms and we t to the ER and they did a CT scan without contrast. Everything was fine and all was good. It got better however about 2 years ago I've begun suffering with bad deja vu. 

I was homeless living in a hotel for 9 months with my family and we eventually found a place and so the night before I couldn't sleep. I ended up staying up the whole day for over 24 hours and began getting these weird symptoms. it felt as though I was about to remember something super important. Kinda like deja Vu. Anything could trigger it and I'd be about to remember what it was but then forget. Well I assumed this was just from lack of sleep so eventually like two days later it stopped.  

Ever since then on and off I've been getting deva by that could last anywhere from 1 second to 50 seconds. Whenever id get this intense memory that I'm about to remember I would get scared. Kinda like that anxiety feeling in your stomach. I assumed this was just anxiety as I had the same stomach symptoms when my heart would flutter or if I ever got anxious in general. Well I made the mistake of googling and came across posts of people explaining epilepsy and how they'd experience these symptoms.  I panicked and thought I had a brain tumor so I called 911 and got taken to the hospital again and they did another CT scan without contrast. 

A neurologist say down with me and told me that I definitely don't have a brain tumor and that she highly doubts it's epilepsy but to play it safe scheduled me for an MRI and eeg in November just to make sure there's no seizure activity. 

My question is, she thinks it's anxiety but can anxiety really do this? Weirdly enough that memory symptom I got where I'd be on the verge of remembering went away after my ER visit. For almost a month I felt great then I started worrying again and boom they started happening almost nightly now. To even test myself I'd say my address out loud to see if I was unable to speak etc and all is good. It only lasts a second or 2. Like a quick flash of deja Vu of something I'm about to remember but can't grasp it. I'd get the stomach anxiety sensation but it's not like my reality shifts and I zone out or I can't speak etc. It's just that feeling scares me and I've been so anxious about it happening again that when it does I get that stomach feeling and that makes me even more anxious. It's a cycle that's really difficult and I just don't know if I have health anxiety and am overthinking 😭

,Anxietyhelp,"Well I decided to finally take something for what I’m dealing with. 

As a kid I was always afraid of heights but I pushed through it and rode roller coasters, went to the top of the John Hancock building, and even flew a few times.


Then my best friend died at 34 of mouth cancer. Never smoked. Never chewed tobacco.

That’s when stuff started getting bad for me.

First I had a bad panic attack driving on a freeway in New York. I now can barely drive on the freeway for only extremely short periods and only in the slow lane.

Then I started having problems with elevators and escalators. I literally get jello legs when I get on them now.

And finally recently I started getting dizzy when I walk into restaurants or waiting in line at the grocery store. I like tense up and get dizzy. I need to always get a cart now because I need something to hold onto. 

I literally cannot have conversations standing up with people without having something to lean against. I get so disoriented it’s a nightmare. It’s like I have agoraphobia or something.

So my doctor wants me to start the propranolol to see if it helps.

2 days ago, I opened my water bottle with a lot of force and water shot up from the straw, directly into my nose. It went so far up my nose that it was sore for a few hours.

It doesn’t help that I had a slight headache last night. 

I am completely convinced I have been infected with it, it’s just a matter of time until I die. The water went so far up my nose, that if it had amoeba in it, it would have gotten into my brain by now.

,Anxietyhelp,"I'm scared I have ovarian C and my anxiety is eating my alive (i'm such a hypochondriac)

I know that sounds crazy, but i've been having the worst cramping in my pelvis. I went to the doctors to get an ultrasound/annual pap. She didn't feel any lumps or bumps on my pelvis and abdomen - which is good.

Thaven't gotten to official report back from the doctor (like the notes from them) but I could see the ultrasound images. I am no trained expert on how to read these, and I wish I never looked at them, but they look different from the one I had done last year (which was completely normal). This one, my ovaries have clusters of black circles with lots of blood flow around them - like 4 semi big black circles and lots of blue and red markers (blood flow).

I know follicles are small black circles spread out on the ultrasound, but these ones are a little bigger and in a cluster connected to each other with seemingly a lot of blood flow.

I can&amp;#39;t hang around with my friends anymore because all they talk about is cars, or driving and it makes me so stressed I end up going completely cold/numb or literally fainting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried driving almost every day since I got news that the house was sold, and almost every time I couldn&amp;#39;t go farther than a few houses length without my entire body going numb (like literally paralyzed and my extremities become freezing cold), my hearing becoming muffled, etc. - just typing this and thinking about it is making me panic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am freaking the heck out, I have no idea how I&amp;#39;m going to get to the new house. It&amp;#39;s a 3-hour drive through a national park, with absolutely no civilization inbetween the two towns. On a road with a record number of car accidents. And I have to drive my half-broken car, without winter tires, through a province that gets snow 6 months a year (surprised we haven&amp;#39;t gotten snow yet).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What can I do? My GP passed away shortly before the car incident, I&amp;#39;ve been on a waiting list to meet with a psychologist/psychotherapist/whatever for over a year and I still haven&amp;#39;t heard from them, despite calling them multiple times asking for urgent help. I&amp;#39;ve tried looking for emergency shelters while I get treatment if I can ever get an appointment but they&amp;#39;re all overfilled and underfunded as is, and they&amp;#39;re incredibly unsafe. I could live in my car but the temperatures are getting really cold, and I have no money to feed myself. I feel completely lost and I need help urgently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the wall of text, and thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': True, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '49eaa632-71c0-11ec-973f-3ef47b8f4b79', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_3195p', 'author_is_blocked': False, 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '#dadada', 'id': '1g2xzgp', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'DietWaterIsLife', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 1, 'send_replies': True, 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/drivinganxiety/comments/1g2xzgp/3hour_drive_in_2_weeks_i_need_help/', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/drivinganxiety/comments/1g2xzgp/3hour_drive_in_2_weeks_i_need_help/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 34534, 'created_utc': 1728848544.0, 'num_crossposts': 1, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",/r/drivinganxiety/comments/1g2xzgp/3hour_drive_in_2_weeks_i_need_help/,t3_1g2xzgp,,,,,

,Anxietyhelp,"My partner has been getting regular anxiety attacks, usually centered around his health. He'll hear his heart beating, overheat, or his breathing will speed up, then he'll freak out that there is something seriously wrong. Sometimes just in general, sometimes specifically with his heart. It's usually in the evening before bed, then he won't sleep well, he gets more exhausted, the cycle continues. It's getting to the point I do not look forward to evenings because there's a solid chance it'll be a difficult one, even after a good day. He's been incredibly overworked to the point he hasn't made time to see a doctor or therapist despite my begging, he lost his best friend to suicide earlier this year (though these anxiety attacks were happening before then), and went through an abusive relationship several years ago. He's never sought help and he says he's open to it (he wasn't before this year), but hasn't made time for it.

I want to remind him of what the reality is in that it's just anxiety and he's not going to die, but I also don't want to casually dismiss his health concerns either, so I want to make sure I'm validating his feelings and giving him space to feel anxious. I usually tidy the area so it's less visually anxious, provide water and snacks, give shoulder rubs, put comforting tv on, and keep him company to soothe his worries about being seriously ill. He's always been fine after, albeit exhausted, and not shown any signs of serious health issues. I'm not sure if it makes it better to point out how often this happens, I don't want to make him feel worse like he's a burden while he's already feeling awful. 

He's the most wonderful partner and has always supported me through my anxieties, but mine are more generalized and can generally be soothed with food, cuddles, and sleep.

,Anxietyhelp,"This is gonna be really long but please read and help me, I’m desperate. I’m 21 and have been smoking weed since 18, but I’ve suffered debilitating anxiety my whole life. When I first started smoking it didn’t actually affect my anxiety for a while. My parents seemed pretty okay with it for the most part and I always did it comfortably at my best friends maybe every other 3 weeks. I never did when I was at home because I never wanted my parents to see me high. There was something about that that always made me feel ashamed if they did. Fast forward after living in an apartment for less than a year I had to move back in with my parents but was still smoking weed, unbothered, until one night I tried smoking in the house and my dad got really upset with me. Not only this but it seemed like the weed was doing something weird to me and giving me this weird irrational and angry personality. My parents are also religious so they got in my head one day that every time I smoke I’m letting the demons in and that’s why it was affecting my mood so much after I’d smoke, and since then my parents became more and more opposed to it, so I’ve essentially pretended I’ve stopped smoking it for their sake, but had continued to anyway with dab pens. However, it got to the point that no matter what, I was experiencing an anxiety attack every time I smoked because I couldn’t stop becoming afraid that demons really were attaching to me. I was smoking dabs in the house anyway but finally quite because that plus being afraid my parents would wake up in the middle of the night and try to talk to me while I was high was giving me incredible fear and panic attacks and so I stopped smoking weed. 
At some point, I’d been introduced to delta 8, and started smoking delta 8 carts instead, and I liked them because they seemed like they couldn’t really get me that high, so any anxiety I had over my parents catching me high had been quelled… to a point. That anxiety eventually came back anyway and pretty much every night that I smoked delta 8 and got a little too high I would there panicking every night. This pretty much had been happening up until since I’ve moved out of the home once again. I figure the anxiety would stop and I could smoke my delta 8 every night in peace and get as high as I wanted but that has never been the case. I’ve only been living away from home for a couple months and my anxiety attacks are worse now than they’ve ever been, but now for different reasons. I already knew smoking carts is not good for you, at least compared to smoking bud, but I only just learned recently that apparently delta 8 has been giving some individuals strokes and/or audio hallucinations, which I personally had been experiencing the entire time I’ve been smoking it but decided to ignore it. Not just delta 8 but it seems like I’m hearing more and more people my age are having heart attacks even from “unknown causes”, but I feel like they can most likely be traced back to people’s overconsumption of vaping. I don’t actually vape but I’ve been smoking from a cart every night for the past 3 years and I’m definitely starting to feel it in my lungs. 
Anyway, all of this to say, everytime I smoke now I have this debilitating anxiety attack after a while that turns into me having these constant thought loops of me assuming I’m having a heart attack or a stroke because the attacks physical symptoms have been so uncomfortable. I start out with this heart palpitation, which immediately makes me incredibly afraid, which turns into me feeling like I can’t breath, my heart beating way too fast making me think it’s gonna give out any second, and weird tingly feelings in only one leg. I feel like realistically I’m not actually experiencing a heart attack or stroke, only cause if I really was I’d obviously be way worse off, but I also know that heart attack symptoms actually look different in women and I’m afraid I’ve just been ignoring the symptoms. I’ve also been too afraid to even post here because I’m afraid someone’s gonna tell me I actually am having a heart attack and I better go to the doctor. But even just the anxiety of thinking about having to go to the doctor, my parents being alerted, and then my parents needing to know why I had a heart attack is making me feel crazy worse. Now I’ve been having a current anxiety attack that has lasted almost a full 24 hours and was only quelled by me finally being able to fall asleep at 4am. I’m getting myself all worked up even as I write this post and I’m so afraid of what’s happening. I’m so afraid it’s an actual heart attack, but I know that there are physical symptoms to anxiety attacks like this that can be common and I’m trying and failing to convince myself that that’s all that’s happening. All attempts at distracting myself from the fear of falling over half dead have not been helping. I’m worried that if I relax it’s gonna cause my heart to slow down too much and it’ll just stop. I’m seriously desperate and don’t know what to do. I thought maybe if I worked out it would help distract me but I’m worried trying to work out and get my heart rate up when I’m already having issues breathing would be a bad idea. Does anybody have any tips or has been in a similar situation? Am I actually stroking out right now or just having a classic anxiety attack and I’m making it worse out of my own fear? Please help !!

,Anxietyhelp,"As someone with health anxiety &amp; panic disorder with agoraphobia who used to call ambulances daily and went to the hospital/ER almost every day for a year and had many doctor's appointments, I made a video to share my thoughts and what I've learned that's helped me. To summarise the video:

**The short answer:** You can't always tell, but over the years, I’ve learned how to manage my health anxiety better. Here are some things that helped me:

* **If you feel something’s wrong, see a doctor first.** This post is for people who’ve already been checked out multiple, maybe even hundreds of times, and still deal with health anxiety. It's not medical advice.
* **Anxiety can mimic almost any physical symptom.** From dizziness to heart palpitations, anxiety can make you feel like something’s seriously wrong, even if you’ve experienced it before. I've even had vision disturbances caused by anxiety.
* **Real health problems are usually clear.** In my experience, when something was actually wrong, it was obvious. With anxiety, it’s the uncertainty that causes the panic. (""Am I having a heart attack?? or is my heart just racing from anxiety?"" vs literally on the floor from severe pain.) If you can panic about it, then it's probably panic.
* **Acceptance is the key.** You’ll never be able to check for every possible condition. Once I accepted that health issues *could* happen, but I would deal with them if and when they did, I became less consumed by fear.
* **Living with uncertainty:** Trying to determine if every symptom is anxiety or something serious isn’t sustainable. Acceptance frees you to focus on what you *can* control, allowing you to live a fuller life.

**TL;DR:** You can’t always tell if it’s anxiety or a real health problem, but acceptance of uncertainty helps you manage anxiety without it controlling your life.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi everyone, I could really use some advice or insight from anyone who’s been through something similar.

A while ago, I started experiencing some intense physical symptoms out of nowhere—dizziness, short of breath fast heartbeat trembling, and feeling extremely weak. It got so bad that I went to the hospital because of it only to find out it was only a side affect to a medication that I take knowing that I have HLHS I’ve been in and out of the hospital due to some symptoms in which I feel like the same thing will happen again, I went to the hospital three times, convinced there was something seriously wrong. They ran tests, but everything came back normal. I was relieved on one hand, but also left wondering why I felt so awful.
, and if I can really do anything without the constant amount of worrying,

After that, my anxiety kicked into overdrive. I became hyperaware of every sensation in my body and started constantly worrying about my health. I was ruminating a lot, feeling scared and unsure of so many things, and found it difficult to relax. It was like I couldn’t turn my mind off, and every small symptom made me anxious all over again. Strangely it never became problematic where it would turn into a panick attack or anxiety attack there for I’m not sure if I’m feeling Those small symptoms simply because my body is still in recovery or because my mind is still thinking about what happened, especially cuz at the hospital I would only get 2 to 3 hours of sleep and they were constantly talking blood from me for testing

Lately, I feel like I might be slowly getting over it—I haven’t experienced those intense physical symptoms as often, and I can usually relax eventually. But I still have moments where my heart slightly runs unexpectedly but it goes away and I’m left wondering if it’s just stress anxiety or something else, or I find myself ruminating and wondering if I’m truly improving.

I’m trying not to worry when these things happen, but I don’t always know if it’s just residual anxiety or something else. Has anyone gone through this kind of recovery process? How did you handle those lingering symptoms, and how did you know if you were actually getting better?

Thanks in advance for any advice or shared experiences. I really appreciate it.

,Anxietyhelp,"Moving into a triplex in November with my partner. We will be on the second of 3 floors in a 2 bed, 1 bath unit - 1050sq ft. The house is old, built in the 1970s.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi!

So before I list down any of my symptoms. I'm already trying to see a doctor in real life. And possibly trying to get a therapist as well.

+++

( I was fine. And I had no symptoms before any of these events happened. )

+++

Before any of my symptoms showed up. I had lost my dad due to cancer. At 10. I saw him hallucinating. And losing weight. And getting weaker.

After he died. I went through online-bullying for months. Daily. I was constantly crying. I was getting name-called, insulted. Daily. Drama, fighting.

A few months before my symptoms abruptly happened. I saw gore on the Internet. At the age of 12. Which caused. Me to feel crappy. Feel weird. Crying.

my online-best friend ( now ex friend. ) possibly have doxxed me.

And some real life stuff that I'm not gonna get into. ( real life, name-calling me, or calling me pathetic etc.)

My symptoms then suddenly showed up on December 8th 2020. My first symptom. Was chronic upper gastrointestinal nausea. In my chest area and upper stomach ONLY.

And I had that symptom for at least a year before other symptoms and behaviours started showing up in 2022.

My symptoms:

1. Chronic upper gastrointestinal nausea ( in my chest area and upper stomach only. And it's daily and chronic. But has had times where it had calmed down.  )
2. Sudden headaches that last for days.
3. Heart skipping/fluttering/or making a drop/skip like-beats?
4. Feeling unwell daily.
5. Stuttering.
6. Feeling weird sensations in my head and body. ( But it would go away when distracted. )
7. Feeling light-headed when focusing on my breathing. ( would go away when distracted. )
8. Feeling like I might throw up or gag almost constantly. ( which is scary since I fear this. Possibly emetophobia. )
9. Hot sweats/hot flashes. ( not often I get them, but they did happen. )
10. Feeling like food or something was stuck in my throat for weeks.
11. Tingling/buzzing sensation in my face/hands/arms/back/feet/and around or on top of head.
12. Waking up from my sleep quite a lot.
13. Constant fast heart rate, to the second I wake up. To the minute I go asleep.
14. Feeling like something bad was gonna happen inside my body.
15. Slight tight feeling in throat.
16. Dry mouth.
17. Feeling miserable and unhappy almost constantly and lack of interest. And losing interest in things I used to love and enjoy. having no motivation.
18. Lack of self-care. Such as bathing, brushing teeth etc.
19. Under-eating or over-eating. or barely eating and drinking enough as i should. ( idk if this is a symptom or not. )
20. Symptoms changing, or going away. Or new ones coming for a while. Or becoming chronic.
21. A weird cold sensation on my back.
22. Cold hands and feet. ( im observing this one. Because it could be the weather. )
23. Under eye-twitching for days.
24. Pacing up and down.
25. Believing I had the same illnesses etc as somebody else everytime I heard about it or saw it.
26. Googling symptoms.
27. Constantly asking for reassurance about my health.
28. Getting angry and annoyed easily. ( I have been like this kinda since my childhood. So idk. )
29. Forgetting things.
30. Constantly constipated.
31. Stomach or intestines growling/gurgling.
32. Feeling like my legs were heavy.
33. hypnic jerk. Jerking up from my sleep when falling asleep.
34. Feeling like I couldn't swallow properly?
35. Seeing shadow-people at the corners of my eyes, and they dissappear when I look at them.
36. Aches and pains. ( not bad or severe. )
37. in foods and drinks.
38. Suicidal thoughts, and self-harming.
39. Feeling like I'm dying? ( unsure. )
40. Feeling like my mind was blank even though I was thinking.
41. My symptoms getting worse a week before my period starts.
42. Thinking about the past pretty much constantly. ( i don't know if this is a symptom or not. )
43. Ear ringing.
44. Slight head squeezing pressure.
45. Feeling weird and odd.
46. Feeling like I was gonna freak out and call a ambulance for myself.
47. weird feeling under stomach by hips.
48. Feeling weird when talking about some things.
49. Feeling like my soul was gonna leave my body.
50. Possible catastrophic thinking.
51. Loss of sex-drive. ( Sexual Dysfunction, sexual uninterest. )
52. Lack of sympathy for what others are going through. ( depending on what it is. )
53. Uncertainty and doubt.
54. Waking up with my top teeth biting my lip.
55. Having dreams of my worries/fears sometimes.
56. Focusing on symptoms 24/7.
57. Thinking about past actions or past memories. Daily, or making up fake stories or making things up in my head.
58. ""Stuck thoughts"" ? thoughts, mental images, concepts, songs, or melodies that 'stick' in your mind and replay over and over again. ( unsure. But all I know is that I repeat things and can't stop thinking about it. )
59. Random songs keep playing in my head a little too much or repeating.
60. Having to go bathroom every hour? ( I think. But im observing this one. )
61. breathing a bit more quickly? ( NOT SUPER quickly. )

++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Again before anybody says anything. Yes I'm trying to see a doctor. But im wondering if this is a sign that my nervous system is on over-drive or something due to the past things?

I'm unsure how anything of this works. But it's bothering me. I've also noticed that my tongue was been twitching? And I've had tingling sensation across my head and at the side of my face today.

how do I get back into my ""parasympathetic nervous system"" again? if that's what it's called.

I've tried doing breathing techniques but im not good at them. I've tried super easy yoga poses. and I haven't noticed any changes. ( I know its not gonna work immediately. it could take days. or weeks. ) but I don't know what to do? Am I like stuck in chronic fight-or-flight mode??

I'm not asking for medical advice, I just don't know what to do? having emetophobia isn't helping me either since I'm already struggling to take care of myself. and eating is like a pure-nightmare. and it feels like I can't stop.

but I can't get myself ""out of it."" and it feels like I can't stop either. but again before any of those events happened. I was fine. I had no symptoms. no nothing. but then it just hit me out of nowhere. so I know there's gotta be a link and connection between that, and this.

  
and what I've realized is that I think I've been breathing from my chest for a few years. when those things happened or something. I THINK I used to breathe from my stomach before.

&lt;p&gt;So before I list down any of my symptoms. I&amp;#39;m already trying to see a doctor in real life. And possibly trying to get a therapist as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;( I was fine. And I had no symptoms before any of these events happened. )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before any of my symptoms showed up. I had lost my dad due to cancer. At 10. I saw him hallucinating. And losing weight. And getting weaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After he died. I went through online-bullying for months. Daily. I was constantly crying. I was getting name-called, insulted. Daily. Drama, fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months before my symptoms abruptly happened. I saw gore on the Internet. At the age of 12. Which caused. Me to feel crappy. Feel weird. Crying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my online-best friend ( now ex friend. ) possibly have doxxed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some real life stuff that I&amp;#39;m not gonna get into. ( real life, name-calling me, or calling me pathetic etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My symptoms then suddenly showed up on December 8th 2020. My first symptom. Was chronic upper gastrointestinal nausea. In my chest area and upper stomach ONLY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I had that symptom for at least a year before other symptoms and behaviours started showing up in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chronic upper gastrointestinal nausea ( in my chest area and upper stomach only. And it&amp;#39;s daily and chronic. But has had times where it had calmed down.  )&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Slight tight feeling in throat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dry mouth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling miserable and unhappy almost constantly and lack of interest. And losing interest in things I used to love and enjoy. having no motivation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of self-care. Such as bathing, brushing teeth etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under-eating or over-eating. or barely eating and drinking enough as i should. ( idk if this is a symptom or not. )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symptoms changing, or going away. Or new ones coming for a while. Or becoming chronic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A weird cold sensation on my back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cold hands and feet. ( im observing this one. Because it could be the weather. )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under eye-twitching for days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pacing up and down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Believing I had the same illnesses etc as somebody else everytime I heard about it or saw it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Googling symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly asking for reassurance about my health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting angry and annoyed easily. ( I have been like this kinda since my childhood. So idk. )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forgetting things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly constipated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stomach or intestines growling/gurgling.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Aches and pains. ( not bad or severe. )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in foods and drinks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suicidal thoughts, and self-harming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling like I&amp;#39;m dying? ( unsure. )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling like my mind was blank even though I was thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My symptoms getting worse a week before my period starts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking about the past pretty much constantly. ( i don&amp;#39;t know if this is a symptom or not. )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ear ringing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slight head squeezing pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling weird and odd.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Feeling like my soul was gonna leave my body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible catastrophic thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of sex-drive. ( Sexual Dysfunction, sexual uninterest. )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of sympathy for what others are going through. ( depending on what it is. )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncertainty and doubt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waking up with my top teeth biting my lip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having dreams of my worries/fears sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focusing on symptoms 24/7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking about past actions or past memories. Daily, or making up fake stories or making things up in my head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Stuck thoughts&amp;quot; ? thoughts, mental images, concepts, songs, or melodies that &amp;#39;stick&amp;#39; in your mind and replay over and over again. ( unsure. But all I know is that I repeat things and can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about it. )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random songs keep playing in my head a little too much or repeating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having to go bathroom every hour? ( I think. But im observing this one. )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;breathing a bit more quickly? ( NOT SUPER quickly. )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again before anybody says anything. Yes I&amp;#39;m trying to see a doctor. But im wondering if this is a sign that my nervous system is on over-drive or something due to the past things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m unsure how anything of this works. But it&amp;#39;s bothering me. I&amp;#39;ve also noticed that my tongue was been twitching? And I&amp;#39;ve had tingling sensation across my head and at the side of my face today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;how do I get back into my &amp;quot;parasympathetic nervous system&amp;quot; again? if that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried doing breathing techniques but im not good at them. I&amp;#39;ve tried super easy yoga poses. and I haven&amp;#39;t noticed any changes. ( I know its not gonna work immediately. it could take days. or weeks. ) but I don&amp;#39;t know what to do? Am I like stuck in chronic fight-or-flight mode??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not asking for medical advice, I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do? having emetophobia isn&amp;#39;t helping me either since I&amp;#39;m already struggling to take care of myself. and eating is like a pure-nightmare. and it feels like I can&amp;#39;t stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but I can&amp;#39;t get myself &amp;quot;out of it.&amp;quot; and it feels like I can&amp;#39;t stop either. but again before any of those events happened. I was fine.

,Anxietyhelp,"Just need to get this all of my chest. It all started 2021 when I had my first panic attack. Went to the ER lightheaded, hyperventilating. They were actually really nice to me and it helped me a lot. At this time I was in treatment for depression, no meds just therapy and it really helped me a lot. I finished the Therapy for depression in 2021 and started med school. 
From 2021-2024 I had no real problems with my mental health. 
Then I took my Step 1 ( im studying in Germany, so it’s something different but similar). It was a really stressful episode with a lot of fear of failure. I managed to take this step successfully tho. At this time I really felt exhausted but still no real mental health problems. The next semester began shortly after my step 1 and I dove head first into the workload of it. In the beginning of 2024 it all began. I had a relatively small car crash. Nobody including me was physically hurt, just damage to the car. It was my fault bc stupidly I was distracted by my phone. 
Didn’t really made much out of it. I moved in together with my gf, which is the best decision I made. 
After the semester was done in march 2024 I directly did a “Famulatur” ( kinda like a doctor apprenticeship for med students, you’re obligated to do 4 months in Germany) for a month. 
And there it all started kinda. Since I did my Famulatur in my hometown I went for a drink with my buddies ( I’m 25 btw). Next morning I woke up and had a strange feeling of anxiety. Like something is off with my body. Thought I had high blood pressure or something. After about 2-3 weeks after that I somewhat calmed down. 
Starting the new Semster in April I again dove head first into the workload. Up until the 16 of June. It was soccer European championship ( also in Germany lol) so I was hyped for a nice evening with my homies! We had a great evening, including a bbq and some drink. 
Next morning after I woke up I instantly felt something was off. Didn’t thought much of it, went to the grocery store to get something to eat. After I got back home it fucking hit me. Had the worst anxiety attack of my life. Thought I couldn’t walk and was gonna die. Called my gf and 911. Went to the ER. They did some blood work, ECG and said it was a panic attack, went home. 
Since then it all went downhill. Constant feeling of dizziness, have to check my pulse constantly, have to look how my poop looks etc. 
I also feel like I got depression back. In September I had the first holidays for 4 weeks since  March 2023. Also it feels good it started a whole lot more. My depression got worse and I started fasciculation in my legs. Was really scared I had ALS, but my doctor didn’t made much of it. I started Citalopram 10 mg for both the depression and anxiety. I have the feeling it kinda helps. But now I feel like my legs get weaker ( more like a perceived weakness, I can jump, walk, on my heels and my toes) paraestheasias in my legs when I sit in a crossed leg style, sometimes even a bit of burning sensations in my legs. I also sometimes feel like my legs or arms “don’t belong to my body”. 
I’m starting cognitive behavioural therapy next week.

Next morning after I woke up I instantly felt something was off. Didn’t thought much of it, went to the grocery store to get something to eat. After I got back home it fucking hit me. Had the worst anxiety attack of my life. Thought I couldn’t walk and was gonna die. Called my gf and 911. Went to the ER. They did some blood work, ECG and said it was a panic attack, went home. 
Since then it all went downhill. Constant feeling of dizziness, have to check my pulse constantly, have to look how my poop looks etc. 
I also feel like I got depression back. In September I had the first holidays for 4 weeks since  March 2023. Also it feels good it started a whole lot more. My depression got worse and I started fasciculation in my legs. Was really scared I had ALS, but my doctor didn’t made much of it. I started Citalopram 10 mg for both the depression and anxiety. I have the feeling it kinda helps. But now I feel like my legs get weaker ( more like a perceived weakness, I can jump, walk, on my heels and my toes) paraestheasias in my legs when I sit in a crossed leg style, sometimes even a bit of burning sensations in my legs. I also sometimes feel like my legs or arms “don’t belong to my body”. 
I’m starting cognitive behavioural therapy next week. 
I don’t know what to expect from this post. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Last year I was going through really hard time, mental health wise. I was on heavy medication for anxiety, depression and sleeping pills. 
I live alone , away from family. 
I got very low on point and I started to go on dates to cheer me up. 
Because of the decisions I made, I decided to do STD tests and thankfully only chlamydia got positive. I did the antibiotic course and this issue was resolved. 
Just to be sure I did the same course of test again and results were negative. I talked with the doctor that is it okay if I start dating again? Do I need to do any other tests. Doctor said my STD are cleared up and it is okay to do sex from now on. 
So I started to date a really nice guy. And we we only had protected sex. 
One day I found warts on my private parts. I went to the doctor and I ended up getting HPV and herpes. Doctors did not do tests for HPV and herpes in first place, even though I asked them again and again if I need to do any other tests. I ended up giving HPV and herpes to this nice guy. I feel really guilty and horrible. I tried to be 100% clean before I get into sexual activity with someone else. 

I feel very anxious and sad . I have done all tests just to be sure that I have not caught life threatening diseases. Thankfully it is only hpv and herpes. 
But I keep getting anxious about how lucky I got and it would have been disastrous. I would have put this new guy in very dangerous situation. I don’t want him to pay for the mistakes that I made. 
Even though all tests are done and only hpv herpes is positive I keep getting anxious about same tests. I did full STD tests 4 times over the year and except hpv and herpes they all are negative. What if I miss something? What if I go to the doctors and they say I got another STD? I feel fear to go to the doctors now. 
Can someone please comfort me that everything will be okay?

,Anxietyhelp,"Hello everyone. So for context, about 2 years and 2 months ago I was getting weird deja Vu symptoms where I'd feel like I was about to remember something super important and familiar but lost it. This happened for two days and then turned into traditional deja Vu that would come and go. Well about a month ago, on my birthday to be exact, I was getting deja Vu episodes that would make my stomach feel weird. I immediately assumed it was a seizure, panicked and called 911. 

I went to the er and they did a CT scan without contrast and the neurologist say down with me after doing a bunch of basic physical neurology tests. I told her my biggest fear was a brain tumor and she said I definitely do not have one. Especially since I had deja Vu for 2 years now, if it where a brain tumor, it most likely would be causing me to get worse symptoms. She said in November they'll follow up with me and do an MRI to check for last scaring and do an EEG to test for seizures which she said she doesn't believe I have but will make sure so that way if it is I can be out on medication. 

Funny enough, after this ER visit and they did the CT scan and said I have no brain tumor, I felt much less deja vu and felt much better actually. Well now a month later and I'm getting those weird feelings of deja Vu where I feel like I'm about to remember something important and I'm now back to worrying. I mean if it's seizures, I'll be able to medicine and the idea of it being a brain tumor seems out of the question as she told me with confidence I don't have one. Maybe the reason I'm worried is because I heard an MRI with contrast is the best at finding brain tumors. But I can't ignore the reality that this neurologist is trained in this profession and if she knows I don't have one then I should trust her.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey everyone,

I’ve always been a tech-savvy guy who loves getting the latest gadgets—whether it’s a laptop, monitor, smartphone, or any other device. I’m the type of person who wants everything maxed out and set perfectly, and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that! I paid for these things with my own money, so I want the best experience. But ever since I got my first new laptop, I’ve been trapped in this exhausting cycle of anxiety and constant checking.

Whenever I’m setting up something new—whether it’s brightness, resolution, or system settings—I feel like everything *has* to be perfect. Even with settings that have a “save” button, I still get anxious, thinking maybe it didn’t save properly, or maybe I missed something. For settings without a save button, it’s even worse because how do I know if it worked? It pushes me to check over and over.

What spikes my anxiety the most is the pressure to set everything up perfectly the first time so I can forget about it. But the moment I start, my anxiety takes over. I can’t focus, and I get frustrated that I didn’t do it right, so I try again, thinking I’ll be more careful next time. But the more I try, the worse the anxiety gets, and my brain starts to get foggy. I find it harder to concentrate, and after a while, I get even more tired and frustrated. This only makes it harder to focus, leading me to recheck and redo things over and over. It’s completely draining.

Even after I’ve adjusted or checked something, the anxiety doesn’t go away. I start ruminating—worrying that I might’ve unchecked something by accident while exiting, or maybe I didn’t save the changes correctly. My mind keeps spinning, wondering if I missed something or screwed anything up. It’s a never-ending loop of doubt, and it’s exhausting.

What I don’t understand is how some of you can just set things up and not worry! You’ve spent thousands on these devices—how can brief checks be enough? For me, even a simple setting can be overwhelming. Sometimes, I’ll stare at one setting for minutes just to reassure myself that it’s exactly how I want it, and that I haven’t missed anything. I want to feel excited about getting new gadgets and trying out new features, but now I feel scared even thinking about buying a new PC, monitor, or smartphone in the future.

This anxiety has also spilled over into things like game settings, app settings, or anything that can be set up, making it even more overwhelming.

It would be really great to connect with people going through the same thing or to hear advice from anyone who’s managed to overcome this. Any tips or strategies would be hugely appreciated!

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I’m setting up something new—whether it’s brightness, resolution, or system settings—I feel like everything &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be perfect. Even with settings that have a “save” button, I still get anxious, thinking maybe it didn’t save properly, or maybe I missed something. For settings without a save button, it’s even worse because how do I know if it worked? It pushes me to check over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What spikes my anxiety the most is the pressure to set everything up perfectly the first time so I can forget about it. But the moment I start, my anxiety takes over. I can’t focus, and I get frustrated that I didn’t do it right, so I try again, thinking I’ll be more careful next time. But the more I try, the worse the anxiety gets, and my brain starts to get foggy. I find it harder to concentrate, and after a while, I get even more tired and frustrated. This only makes it harder to focus, leading me to recheck and redo things over and over. It’s completely draining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after I’ve adjusted or checked something, the anxiety doesn’t go away. I start ruminating—worrying that I might’ve unchecked something by accident while exiting, or maybe I didn’t save the changes correctly. My mind keeps spinning, wondering if I missed something or screwed anything up. It’s a never-ending loop of doubt, and it’s exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I don’t understand is how some of you can just set things up and not worry! You’ve spent thousands on these devices—how can brief checks be enough? For me, even a simple setting can be overwhelming. Sometimes, I’ll stare at one setting for minutes just to reassure myself that it’s exactly how I want it, and that I haven’t missed anything. I want to feel excited about getting new gadgets and trying out new features, but now I feel scared even thinking about buying a new PC, monitor, or smartphone in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This anxiety has also spilled over into things like game settings, app settings, or anything that can be set up, making it even more overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be really great to connect with people going through the same thing or to hear advice from anyone who’s managed to overcome this. Any tips or strategies would be hugely appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"So I’m going on here because I have no other options, I have had hypersalivation for the last three months and its driven me crazy. Here’s some context, I am a 20-year-old male who exercises almost daily, I don’t drink soda or much processed food. I’m generally a pretty healthy, happy, and chill guy, but this hypersalivation has truly ruined my life completely. It has caused severe stress and anxiety, and it just downright makes me dread waking up in the morning. So it all started when I woke up one day and went to take grandma to the airport and I felt like I couldn’t really talk and my mouth felt weird (I just attributed it to having had woken up early) so I threw in some gum and went about my day, then later that night as I’m chilling on the coach watching a movie I realized my mouth was just filling up incredibly rapidly and I was just confused and then I realized I was hypersalivating for no apparent reason and its been that way since then not stop 24/7 365. I just want to find the cause of my hypersalivation so I can fix it and go about my life again.

My symptoms feel like my mouth just fill right up with water (spit but very serous spit) and If I swallow it’ll just fill right back up again, and when I spit it out it’ll just be very watery spit but I can basically keep spitting into infinity because the production never stops

I have been to 3 ENT doctors who all said everything looked good and I’m in the process of getting a CT scan done on my salivary glands.

I have been to 2 GI doctors who said everything looked good and I got an endoscopy done and all good

I have been to 3 General Doctors who said everything was all good and got blood and urine tests done which also came back perfect

My ideas of Potential causes of hypersalivation are:

-Prior to getting this hypersalivation I water fasted for three full days in which I was chewing gum all day. Somewhere throughout that whole process maybe my parasympathetic system, which controls salivary production got jacked up by something I did and it hasn’t been able to return to its normal state

-The same day the hypersalivation started I also got a tattoo in the upper middle chest that extends to the traps, maybe it caused some nerve damage or affected my nervous system, but I am fairly certain that the hypersalivation started when I woke up and the tattoo was around 2pm

-I do have a very minor overbite and some crowding in my front bottom teeth but overall pretty good teeth and oral hygiene, I did have a dental procedure done about three weeks before the hypersalivation started where apparently I just had a dent in one of my molar and they just did a simple filling on it, but I had no issues the three weeks prior

-I sleep on my stomach/side, not sure if that means anything

-I developed scalloped tongue from the hypersalivation because I have a tendency to move the tongue in a place where it shouldn’t go to try to minimize the rapid accumulation or saliva, also not sure if that means anything either

With all this being said I have no idea what’s wrong with me and the doctors don’t know what’s wrong with me. No, it’s not all in my head. If you saw the shear amounts of saliva, I’m spitting out you’d be surprised. And no, it’s not an anxiety symptom, as yes, this has caused me a great deal of anxiety, but there’s a good chance I went my whole entire life without feeling anxiety before this started, as I’m just not really a anxious guy whatsoever.

In case it wasn’t obvious, I also have chronic anxiety which could be raising my blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? I’ve never had an accurate blood pressure reading my whole life and I’m at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Soo for the past 1.5h years i've dealing with the depression and chronic anxiety. I take multiple antidepressants ( maxed out on basicly everyone and currently waiting for my next appointment with my doctor to disscus the the next plan to get me back on my feet. Talking about the relationship i was depressed but not that severly. Actually that girl showed me what it's like to be alive. Sadly out paths seperated and i was left with severe brokem heart.
The first month was unberabble. I just litteraly cried in my bad eating xanax's - that was the only way for me to calm down and actually forget for a sec.

Forgot to mention i was soo badly in love with girl i almost dropped my meds for her, just keep our sexual life normal, because these pills was keeping me for getting arroud (basicly errectile dysfunction)
 So right now it's been 4 months after break up and i still cant deal with that thought that she is actually gone. I dream of her every single night- waking severly crippled. It feels there is no cure for this Talking about my lifestyle :
nowdays i tried to be the best version of myself

Got a job, started hitting the gym 5x times a week.

Started eatinv healthy and even started therapy session for it few momths 
But at the end the day i am stil anxious and depressed. It feels everything is done not for the passion but jus forcing myself to do 

it I dont have clear goals in my life right And it feels like i will get over this period Talking about meds :

Currently taking
370mg effexor 30 mg of lexapro

For context, I’m a stay at home mom to a 1 year old and 3 year old. My fiancé works 10-12 hour night shift, mostly 6pm-6am. When he’s home at night I don’t really have these issues at all. And I don’t really have anxiety or panic attacks during the day either. I just recently cut off coffee and so far my anxiety has been better. I sometimes get really bad panic attack at night  to where my hands and feet sweat, hot and cold flashes, nausea, my pulse gets fast and my heart races and I feel this sense of “doom” I suppose it’s called. I have no idea why I only have panic attacks at night. It makes it so I can’t sleep. I’ll stay up until like 3am with it. So far I haven’t had a bad panic attack in 3 days.

I think ever since teenage years, I've not been putting myself in uncomfortable situations that can make me grow. Yes I do lack confidence, resilience and idk really.

,Anxietyhelp,"I (18F) just started college a couple weeks ago at a really nice university and I got into a closed major with high GPA, test scores, and multiple letters of recommendation. I’m even graduating two years early and planning to go to grad school after. I knew college wasn’t going to be easy but I didn’t think it would be like this. I can’t seem to handle anything. My grades aren’t bad but they’re definitely not what they should be at. And I know I’m taking really difficult classes but other people in the class seem to be doing just fine. I’m trying to join clubs but I always seem to miss meetings. Everyone else seems to be having such a fun time and be doing well in class and I dont understand it because all of my free time is spent on school work or worrying myself sick or working on internships or making appointments. I literally dreading going to sleep at night because I know I have to wake up in the morning and do it all over again. 

For backround I was diagnosed four years ago with severe anxiety and depression symptoms and I think that I have pure O OCD or some form of OCD in general just based off of research but I’m not too sure yet. Anyways I was never put on meds for my anxiety because my parents didn’t allow me too so I only did one year of therapy. And it did help but now I feel like I’m back at my worst mentally. And it’s not even like I have a reason why I’m doing  bad, my parents are supportive, I have great friends, I have a scholarship so money isnt an issue, and I’m only barely working part time. I just feel like such a complete and utter failure. 

I SHOULD be doing well I SHOULD be getting higher grades and I have no reason NOT to be. Even if my mental health is really low right now it’s only low because I made it low. I didn’t do the things necessary to keep it from getting there and now I can’t get it back up. I just feel like such a bad person. I shouldn’t even be here feeling sorry for myself when I know a lot of other people who have it worse. 

It just makes me wonder, is it me? Is it something about me? Am I just not as good as I thought I was? Am I not good at all? What happens to my future if I can’t do this? Everyone in my life expects me to do well because I always have done well before. I can’t afford to do bad or to not stay on track and I can’t afford to be “too weak” to let my mental health affect me like this. 

A couple days ago I thought about self harm for the first time because I felt so hopeless and isolated and I felt so much guilt from it that I ended up almost throwing up in my dorm room and then sent myself into a panic attack.

I’m even graduating two years early and planning to go to grad school after. I knew college wasn’t going to be easy but I didn’t think it would be like this. I can’t seem to handle anything. My grades aren’t bad but they’re definitely not what they should be at. And I know I’m taking really difficult classes but other people in the class seem to be doing just fine. I’m trying to join clubs but I always seem to miss meetings. Everyone else seems to be having such a fun time and be doing well in class and I dont understand it because all of my free time is spent on school work or worrying myself sick or working on internships or making appointments. I literally dreading going to sleep at night because I know I have to wake up in the morning and do it all over again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For backround I was diagnosed four years ago with severe anxiety and depression symptoms and I think that I have pure O OCD or some form of OCD in general just based off of research but I’m not too sure yet. Anyways I was never put on meds for my anxiety because my parents didn’t allow me too so I only did one year of therapy. And it did help but now I feel like I’m back at my worst mentally. And it’s not even like I have a reason why I’m doing  bad, my parents are supportive, I have great friends, I have a scholarship so money isnt an issue, and I’m only barely working part time. I just feel like such a complete and utter failure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I SHOULD be doing well I SHOULD be getting higher grades and I have no reason NOT to be. Even if my mental health is really low right now it’s only low because I made it low. I didn’t do the things necessary to keep it from getting there and now I can’t get it back up. I just feel like such a bad person. I shouldn’t even be here feeling sorry for myself when I know a lot of other people who have it worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just makes me wonder, is it me? Is it something about me? Am I just not as good as I thought I was? Am I not good at all? What happens to my future if I can’t do this? Everyone in my life expects me to do well because I always have done well before. I can’t afford to do bad or to not stay on track and I can’t afford to be “too weak” to let my mental health affect me like this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago I thought about self harm for the first time because I felt so hopeless and isolated and I felt so much guilt from it that I ended up almost throwing up in my dorm room and then sent myself into a panic attack. It’s like everything that’s ever been wrong with me I’ve done to myself and college is just proving that. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi, I recently made a post on r/illustration basically cos I lost my job as a children's book illustrator due to chronic illness, I was asking people if they could share things that they'd like me to draw for them for free, and then I was going to send drawings to them, I was just doing it to give myself some kind of purpose in life because I feel so depressed and anxious every day and I was trying to think of some idea that could help. Unfortunately the post was removed today just as I was starting to do some of the drawings, I feel so awful and sad because I've lost those comments now and I can't remember who it was that asked for what.

,Anxietyhelp,"So I suffer quite badly from anxiety.

But my anxiety is of a very specific nature.

I get anxious **whenever I have to think critically, do a task, or perform at something.**

This began in school when I would start to become anxious whilst doing extra problems for fun or do my homework. I have always been extremely academically focused and I used to enjoy problem solving a lot.

Now, I get paralysed by fear whenever I approach a question.

I guess I'm afraid deep down that I'm useless / worthless, but I have done work on my thoughts and I no longer believe these things about myself.

What frustrates me is that I basically can't think at all, and I go to a top university in the UK so this is very frustrating because it makes me basically unable to function or work!

I am looking for a way to stop **anxiety at the biological, instinctive level.**

I know that exposure therapy can help with this, but the thing is, I do these tasks several times a day regularly for the last few years, and it hasn't reduced the anxiety **at all.** 

In fact it has gotten worse!!

So I am confused how ""exposing myself"" will help me get over the fear when I expose myself repeatedly daily.

There are also no explicit negative thoughts when I am afraid - it is a biological reaction that happens whenever I'm presented with a task to do!

PLEASE if anyone has a tried and tested method that I can do to **teach my body that I don't need to be afraid then please help! My thoughts are fine and I know that I have nothing to fear, but my body doesn't understand and gets scared anyway!**

,Anxietyhelp,"hi there, hope you're doing good!
i wanted to finally share my nails bitting story and maybe find some help and support.

i went through a very very horrifing childhood, i wont go into details, to not trigger somebody but really all you can imagine.
that resulted in severe cptsd, gad and agoraphobia, traveling with me into my teenage years.
i've been bitting my nails ever since i was very little and im bitting them my whole life.
i tried everything - wearing gloves 24/7, dipping my hands in the toilet water, chilli, bitter nail polish, gel nails..EVERYTHING!
well, im still here, where i started, bitting my nails daily.
it got so bad to the point where i actually cracked my tooth and my bottom front teeth are completely worn down.
that still didnt stop me, not even ingrown nails and nail bed issues - im all in, addicted, with seemingly no escape.
i actually went clean, last year, for 7 months, my nails were absolutely beautiful, i loved it so much, it brought me so much confidence and joy!!
only for another trauma to happen in my life and i relapsed again..i tried many times since but i just can't get a grip again.
those 7 months were the most confident i felt in my whole life, as my hands are my biggest insecurity - i want it back.

,Anxietyhelp,"Tl;dr: I’ve been suppressing my bad days for over a year because it always results in her having anxiety attacks and needing support. I have building apathy toward her attacks and I don’t like it. I love her very much, but it can’t keep going as it has. Please help!

My (m24) gf (f26) of two years has an extreme anxiety disorder. I’ve known this and have always done what I can to help her and support her. She’s taken steps to try and build past it but progress has been really slow. I am at a breaking point though. She has panic attacks very regularly. Usually at least 2 or 3 a month but sometimes she’ll have 3 or 4 within 6 hours or 1 every couple of days. I’ve always helped however I can which is usually sitting and touching her in some way, refocusing her attention on taking deep breaths, and sometimes using ice. Unfortunately, none of it seems to really help all that much. 

Heres where I need help. Im in my third year of college for Engineering and am getting my ass handed to me. It’s bringing out a big problem in our relationship in that I’m just not allowed to have any bad days. For example, today I had two tests back to back and I got 75 on one of them. It was a really rough day. I came home from 10 hours at school just exhausted and emotionally dead. The fact that I was having a miserable day immediately threw off her mood and soon enough she’s having an anxiety attack because I had a bad day. As it usually goes, it turns into me having to spend hours supporting and consoling her through 3 panic attacks. All I want is to be able to have a bad day, talk about it with someone, maybe cry, and just be by myself, but I can’t. I feel like our relationship is becoming more like a parent-child relationship than a loving partnership. When school was easier, I could usually process my bad days internally, but I can’t keep it up anymore. 

Additionally, given the frequency and lack of effective support that I can give her, I’m becoming more and more indifferent to her attacks. I don’t want to become uncaring towards an experience so terrifying and debilitating, but being there for 60+ (rough estimate) anxiety and panic attacks over two years is wearing down on me. At this point I’ll usually put in an earbud with something to keep my mind chugging while I do breathing exercises with her for the 20ish minutes they usually last. When I have to break off of a last minute assignment to help her, I can’t help but just feel the stress and pressure from what I need to do bearing down on me.

I want to be a good boyfriend and support her, but I can’t do another 2 years of endless sacrifice, hiding my bad days, and forcing sympathetic support. I feel horrible even typing that, but it’s where I’m at. So please, has anyone found anything that has helped with being able to share daily life without dragging an extremely anxious person into a hole? Has anyone dealt with building apathy and how can I combat it? Any other recommendations on what might help her anxiety attacks lessen?

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi, I'm already warning you that I probably had depression that had been ignored for several years.I would like to tell because I think I have generalized anxiety since the end of August 2023 I remember it I didn't feel well I wouldn't understand what happened to me, heart beating strangely, difficulty breathing well and the following days I had like tension/heaviness in the neck/back of the head and And when I walked sometimes, I had a weird feeling it was a bit like the feeling when you run on a treadmill and you stop running, you walk in gym, you felt weird for a few seconds. So I start university but I stop after 2 weeks. The worst happens because I started staying at home being sedentary (already I'm overweight basically) staying at home during the winter. I didn't go out and completely shifted my rhythm in sleep, poor lifestyle and at the same time I ruminated, negative thinking a lot again in relation to my state for several years and my current state too. I. I saw the others progressing and starting to get their license, work, study, going out and nothing, I was stuck (I had just turned 18 so I was putting pressure on myself compared to others) I started to develop anxiety who gave me pain/sensations every day that came and went, sometimes new symptoms. Until I was afraid to go outside far away alone, I said to myself imagine I would faint... Sometimes I had nocturnal anxiety which gave me insomnia until 9, 10 a.m. or even 12 p.m. once ( my record). I felt bad in my situation, look at my brothers waking up to go to school, having a routine of sorts and my mother waking up to work, I wasn't sleeping yet (I felt like shit). I was in a real vicious circle of irregular sleep + poor lifestyle + sedentary lifestyle + loneliness + autumn/winter+ anxiety I will list some symptoms for you:

• ⁠pressure neck thorax upper back headache 
• ⁠Feeling of imbalance when I stand still my body turns on itself slightly and when I stand my feet sink into the ground
 • ⁠before sleeping slight tremors/tight throat/crushed chest and sometimes insomnia.
 • ⁠jaw pain going up towards the ear sometimes + weird heartbeat like missed beat 
• sometimes unpleasant tinnitus 
• ⁠Trouble breathing well sometimes as if the middle of the stomach is blocked • ⁠Tingling in the arms/foot/legs 
• ⁠Feeling of being tense / not flexible surely accentuated by excess weight and a sedentary lifestyle. 
•Fear of having something serious

So thank you to those who read, I'm not used to confiding in myself.

I love working out and going to the gym, but last year I suffered with horrible panic attacks daily. I used to go to the gym very often back then and since I was 13, but last year I went and everything went blurry and I thought I was going to faint. I made it out of the gym and into my car where I couldn’t drive in fear of passing out. I’m pretty sure it was an exercise induced panic attack. 

Ever since then I’ve been scared of returning to the gym and have just been working out at home and even bought a treadmill to get in my steps. 

I want to face my fear and go back but I just don’t want to panic and have that happen again, especially around other people. I don’t want to faint or get worried every time I feel my heart racing too fast while at the gym.

I need some beautiful humans, depressed to the Max
I'm depressed, confused and brsin fogged.
My long term anxiety, depression, and somatization are killing me in the last 2-3 months. I'm in decline, I resigned from my job
I isolated myself from freinds and families, not because I want to, but there is a power stronger than me that I can't resist now ...
What's more, my medicine is out of stock since 2 weeks and so a further decline.
Didn't leave home in 2 weeks, didn't pick phone calls from freinds and family members, always alone in my room.
I'm dysfunctional, god granted me some intelligence and capabilities. I resigned but I'm still getting offers while I'm home not making an effort looking for another job. I get called, schedule interviews, abd skip them.
I paid a substantial amount of money to pursue further education and I'm lagging behind already.


I feel I'm being forgotten gradually due to my own isolation.
I find it more than difficult to get out and socialize.
I'm sensing the danger, I need people to talk to, to socialize with eve if on social media, I need to speak at least from behind a screen to feel I'm still connected and alive

,Anxietyhelp,"hi!
i have been experiencing mild (concerning nonetheless) chest pain for few days that comes and goes especially during evenings and early nights. also during these episodes breathing gets more manual and shallow.

 could it be just anxiety even if i don't really stress about anything consciously? i have generalized anxiety disorder so i am on the edge 24/7 lol and everything going on in the world hasn't really made it better. 

reason why i'm suspicious on whether this is anxiety is that there have been times where i have experienced lots of more mental stress but I haven't experienced these kind of symptoms while it.

,Anxietyhelp,"A little context: I am an 18M student who has just started university in the UK around 2 weeks ago. Conveniently, I managed to secure a part time job working on campus. The job in question is the role of a survey assistant, who is tasked with collecting data by going into rooms (such as lectures and classrooms) and count how many individuals turned up to their respective lessons. 

The problem: I have always struggled with social anxiety, but it has recently hit an all time high while working this position. A lot of what my work consists of walking in mid lectures to count the amount of people in the room. These lectures can contain up to 300 people. What’s worse is that the entrances are at the bottom so I have to stand close to where the lecturer is standing to count up the amount of people. Since I am studying there aswell, I am fearful of being stared, laughed at and being recognised while I do this job. I don’t want to have this reputation of being this weird dude who walks in late to lectures with an iPad, standing there for a minute and then leaving again. I don’t want to quit this job as I rely on the money to support my living (rent, food etc) so I have no choice but to stay. I am however committed to conquering my anxiety in the long run.

&lt;p&gt;The problem: I have always struggled with social anxiety, but it has recently hit an all time high while working this position. A lot of what my work consists of walking in mid lectures to count the amount of people in the room. These lectures can contain up to 300 people. What’s worse is that the entrances are at the bottom so I have to stand close to where the lecturer is standing to count up the amount of people. Since I am studying there aswell, I am fearful of being stared, laughed at and being recognised while I do this job. I don’t want to have this reputation of being this weird dude who walks in late to lectures with an iPad, standing there for a minute and then leaving again. I don’t want to quit this job as I rely on the money to support my living (rent, food etc) so I have no choice but to stay. I am however committed to conquering my anxiety in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anyone that can give me advice on my situation?&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"- feeling nauseous after hearing about loved ones or even other people’s indeterminate health scares or what they have been dealing with health wise

When I hear about other people's health scares or what they have been going through or see someone who is sick or has something wrong with them 
I get so nauseous and my body prepares itself to throw up. Today I heard some awful things my sister has been going through and I immediately felt nauseous and like I was going to pass out and one of my ears went out and all fuzzy. I don't know why this happens and I wanted to know if other people have had this happen to them and how to deal with it so I can be there for loved ones without feeling sick. 

Also when i begin to feel sick it just immediately comes up on me, I am not anxious for ages until i work myself up and it happens, it's strange

It has happened to me in many instances and I'm sure it's got something to do with anxiety and maybe even enegry I may be subconsciously picking up on. 

Anyway if anyone has had similar things happen to them please let me know, and any ways of dealing with it.
I would really appreciate it. 

Thankyou

,Anxietyhelp,"So, I don't tend to get anxious about very much, but sex is one of the few things that makes my anxiety skyrocket.  It's not the actual act of sex itself that bothers me, but rather the risks of sex with pregnancy and STDs.

For quite a while I got very nervous after sex because of the possibility of pregnancy, despite the fact that my partners (I've only had 2) and I have always used protection for everything that could cause pregnancy.  But tbh this is more of an outdated topic for me because I had a vasectomy and now don't feel nearly as nervous about this possibility.

However, the thing bothering me currently is STDs, and in-particular HIV.  So, truthfully the likelihood of me being exposed to HIV is quite low, I've only ever had sex with 2 people and it was pretty much always ""safe"".  My first partner had a full STD test set done before we met and hadn't slept with anyone in the time between their test and us having sex, so I never felt worried about it with them.  With my current partner, I wasn't worried about it for a long time (we've been dating for over a year) because they too had said they were tested before we had sex and didn't sleep with anyone between their test and us getting together.  

But then, a few days ago when I brought it up to them, they said that they weren't sure actually if that test included STD testing or was more of a general blood test.  Even still, we've used protection for everything except oral sex and oral sex has a very low likelihood of transmitting HIV, but them saying that they weren't sure sent my anxiety through the roof.  Plus, apparently within a few weeks of exposure to HIV a lot of people have flu-like symptoms, and about a month after we had sex the last time I fell ill for a while.  It was about two weeks, but the thing is after the first few days I started feeling better but then felt ill again.  The 2nd week it was definitely COVID because I tested positive for COVID, but I'm not sure if the first week was also COVID or if it was something else.

I plan on doing one of those home test kits for HIV you can buy right at Walmart and similar stores probably tomorrow because long enough has passed that if I were to have it, I'm well within the period where it would be accurate.  

So, if anyone has any advice on how to calm down in relation to this, please let me know!

I started having panic attacks every night, I would lose sleep and I lost 10 pounds because all I could think about was me having; heart attacks, strokes, cancer ect…I’ve been on several meds since then, but the one I’m on right now is Zoloft. It helps, but recently it’s stopped being super effective. I have panic attacks every so often now, thoughts of me having a heart attack and just overall worry for my health. I’m relatively healthy, overweight but blood tests are pretty clean nonetheless…I’m just worried that it’s not anxiety and I’m gonna have a heart attack. I had gone to the ER about 6 months ago for thinking I was in Afib because of my Apple Watch, they told me my bloodwork was perfect and that my ECG/EKG was good. They told me if I was still worried to go to my doctor and get a monitor put on me for a week. My doc didn’t think it was necessary, so I just kind blew it off. Does anyone else have these fears? &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out to this community because I’m feeling really stuck and overwhelmed in my life right now. Here’s a bit about what I’m going through:

I’m a 31-year-old woman who has been sensitive my whole life, but my anxiety became much worse about six years ago. I struggle with an extremely low tolerance for frustration and can’t accept even minor mistakes, which leads to a cycle of anxiety and self-doubt. This perfectionism has robbed me of confidence, and my self-esteem is at an all-time low.

Socially, I find it incredibly difficult to connect with others. My efforts to avoid social interactions have resulted in profound loneliness, and I often cry in public, which I think discourages others from approaching me. I’ve tried therapy and medications over the years, but I haven’t seen much improvement, and self-help books often feel insincere and unhelpful.

My husband doesn’t understand my struggles and prefers not to be affected by my negativity, which adds to my sense of isolation. Living in a rural area without a driver’s license makes everything feel more confining. I’ve also faced challenges in my career; I have issues with authority and tend to overextend myself, leading to burnout. I’ve started self-employment, but my anxiety makes self-promotion feel impossible.

As a migrant, English isn’t my first language, which complicates my interactions further. I often fantasize about disappearing and starting fresh, but I know that wouldn’t solve my problems. I feel like I’m stagnating, and as I get older, I worry that change will become even harder to achieve.

Financially, I can’t afford therapy anymore, and my anxiety makes it difficult to hold down a regular job. I’m reaching out for advice or support—has anyone else experienced something similar? What steps can I take to start feeling better? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

before that i had a binge over a 5th of vodka, panic attacks took a day to go away, but the anxiety lasted. and that was the first time i experienced that.

and before that... i havent drank in months but ive had a brain fog and dizziness for a very long time prior.

,Anxietyhelp,"I can’t figure out if I lean more towards agoraphobia or amaxophobia.

Long story short. Haven’t left the property (live on a farm) in 7 months except once. A 5 minute car ride one way, and by the time we got to the destination, I didn’t think I could make the ride back. It was a short stop to pick something up and get back home. I felt like an attack was creeping in. Felt it right  before arriving.

I have noticed that the risk of going into an anxiety episode is triggered most easily by car ride, but that’s not the only time I experience it. (I’m not claustrophobic, either.)

I have things I need to do urgently, and they can’t wait, but I don’t know how to handle car rides in order to make it there. Car rides ranging from 30 - 45 minutes to 2+ hours. 

I can leave on foot or by horse and be totally fine. Those things never evoke the sense of an impending attack.

Does anyone have experience with this? Any tips or tricks to distract on rides or out and about so that I don’t slip into a hyper focus on the “what if” of the situation? If I cannot stay glued to something else, my brain likes to lock in on the anxiousness, and obviously that makes it worse.

Once it passes a certain point, I can’t seem to break it. I’ve had attacks last 3 - 4 hours once they reach the “too far gone” state.

&lt;p&gt;Any advice is appreciated. I’m genuinely angry and tired of fighting with this. &lt;/p&gt;

Hi everybody!

So for the past like six months I’ve been freaking out that I have MS. It started with chronic dizziness in March. Got a clear brain MRI in April. Dizziness ended around mid-May.

I moved on accepting it was anxiety, but then I started to feel like I constantly had to urinate. So I moved back to fearing it was because of MS. Dizziness started to come back. My doctor said it was from my anxiety that was so high I was bordering on psychosis.

She didn’t want to do another brain MRI as I already had one in April and I also had one for the same symptoms in 2019, all clear. So we did a full spine MRI. Came back completely clear.

Obviously after two clear brain MRI and a clear full spine MRI, the chances of me having MS are pretty much zero. But I keep thinking “What if we did the MRI too soon and the lesions appeared after?"" and stupid stuff like that. I still feel dizzy so it’s like I can’t move on.

How do you move on after clear tests even when you still experience all these physical symptoms?

Thanks!

,Anxietyhelp,"I feel like this is going to get ranty and may be more of a vent than anything. This post brings up intimate NSFW topics so if that upsets you, that's okay, no need to read it. 


Anyway. I don't really know where to start and I don't know where else to post this. It's definitely fueled by my anxiety, so I hope it's appropriate to post here. I'll try to keep it condensed. My husband and I have been together for 7 years, married for almost 4. Almost an entire decade, and we haven't had sex once. Not once. Not even close. We've been intimate with each other. We have our preferences and our kinks and shit. I have had sex with one person before. My husband has not. He is a virgin still to this day. Intimacy is hard for him and he doesn't know why. He says for some reason he convinces himself that he doesn't want it. He says it's a mental battle every time just to say yes when I initiate, or a mental battle against himself to ask me. 


I have so many issues with myself, how I perceive my body. But I was relatively okay until things got bad about a year or so ago. I was confident in my sexuality and was willing to wait and be patient with my husband. But now I have the same issue. The exact same fucking issue. I have difficulties with guilt whenever I feel aroused. I've withdrawn from my husband in the past month or so. I adore him to pieces and can't get enough of spending time with him, but I've stopped snuggling him. I've stopped spooning him. I haven't asked for intimacy in about a month. The last time I did, I had a panic attack when he said no. And I feel so fucking guilty for that. I hate myself so damn much for that. So I decided to just bottle my shit up. I'm praying, hoping, that my husband can work through whatever it is that's keeping him from being intimate with me anymore. We haven't done anything in like 2 months. Before that, it was one month. Before that, it was 7 fucking months. I keep hoping he'll ask me. I keep hoping he'll go to therapy or some shit. 


I don't know what to do anymore. This isn't me. My love language is physical affection. I need hugs, I need snuggles, it makes me feel safe and secure, and it's my way of doing the same for my husband. But ever since I decided to stop doing that, I've been hurting so fucking much, and I'm trying so fucking hard to hide that from my husband. 


Is it ever going to get better? He wants to have kids some day. He knows how kids happen, right? So what, are we finally going to do it just to have a kid and then he's never going to touch me again? I've been bottling up all these feelings for weeks now and I just want to explode. I'm trying to keep myself distracted, I really am, but I feel like I'm going to break soon.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi all. My son, 23, has been facing increasing sources of anxiety that started at 18. First he couldn’t fly in a plane, then a train, then a bus, and now elevators. He is seeing a therapist weekly and he says it is helping but after 3 years he has now dropped out of college and is barely eating (at 6’2” he is 160 lbs) so I’m not so sure it is. It feels like he’s getting worse. 

I completely understand why his therapist can’t share anything with me, but I’m wondering where his father and I can turn for help in understanding how to best support him through this. We have a good relationship but I struggle with knowing when/where/how much to push. At the same time doing nothing feels not just difficult but also not something you do for a loved one.

My son, 23, has been facing increasing sources of anxiety that started at 18. First he couldn’t fly in a plane, then a train, then a bus, and now elevators. He is seeing a therapist weekly and he says it is helping but after 3 years he has now dropped out of college and is barely eating (at 6’2” he is 160 lbs) so I’m not so sure it is. It feels like he’s getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completely understand why his therapist can’t share anything with me, but I’m wondering where his father and I can turn for help in understanding how to best support him through this. We have a good relationship but I struggle with knowing when/where/how much to push. At the same time doing nothing feels not just difficult but also not something you do for a loved one. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi all -- I have a long-distance flight next week that I am increasingly anxious about.

I've never tried CBD (or weed in general). Could I take CBD oil just before the flight, or do you have to be taking it regularly to see benefits? Would Benadryl work as an alternative? What other options are there?

For me, by far the worst parts are security, boarding, and deplaning, and things like listening to music, tapping, etc., are not enough.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hear me out, this is not intentional. I've had some stomach issue, I feel hungry but have to force myself to eat cause my stomach is somehow always anxious feeling. and I do eat my full meals every day regardless. I force myself to. I noticed my pants that I LITERALLY BOUGHT LAST WEEK felt loose, my belt, was looser, my shirts, were looser. I started freaking myself out cause that wasn't the case last week and I'm like, I'm RAPIDLY losing TONS of weight then if my clothes feel baggier, right? I weighed myself after and I wasn't terribly lighter, 147 vs 150 (my normal). My weight even naturally fluctuates between 147 and 151 daily all the time, but it never manifested in clothing feeling looser. 

No one has told me I look skinnier, I even asked one of my coworkers who sees me once a week and she said I look the same. My stomach is much flatter, I usually look (and have been asked many times) if I'm pregnant, and that's my normal. I haven't had a flat stomach in ages. Thing is, I'm still eating my food, even if I am forcing it down, I am making sure I'm eating all of it so I get all my calories, the only dietary issue that has changed really is my chocolate intake. forcing myself to eat regular food has severely effected my interest in candy, which I always usually binge eat in the evening. 

I'm worried I have the ""C"" word and am just wasting away without actively losing weight. I don't understand why my clothes feel loose like I lost 20 freaking lbs, but my scale (which is accurate) consistently only says I'm maybe 2-3 lbs lighter. Maybe I'm really losing body mass and the weight is fake? Maybe it's just feces building up and my weight is actually withering away? Although, I am pooping some every day. My BF says that everything is all in my head, and I need to chill out and stop assuming the absolute worst thing. He says it's probably water weight because I suddenly stopped pigging out on candy. but I never 'swelled up' before, sure, my stomach was distended and I was a gassy nightmare but I didn't indent when I pressed on my skin or have actual symptoms of bloating on my body, like pain, or visible swelling anywhere on my body...

Maybe I&amp;#39;m really losing body mass and the weight is fake? Maybe it&amp;#39;s just feces building up and my weight is actually withering away? Although, I am pooping some every day. My BF says that everything is all in my head, and I need to chill out and stop assuming the absolute worst thing. He says it&amp;#39;s probably water weight because I suddenly stopped pigging out on candy. but I never &amp;#39;swelled up&amp;#39; before, sure, my stomach was distended and I was a gassy nightmare but I didn&amp;#39;t indent when I pressed on my skin or have actual symptoms of bloating on my body, like pain, or visible swelling anywhere on my body...&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi all,

I'll preface this by making clear I'm *not* 100% sure if I've got tinnitus. In the phase of trying to figure everything out so please bear with me. TLDR at the very end.

The last couple of months i have been in a pretty bad place anxiety wise, had regular panic attacks, etc. Three days ago I suffered a panic attack that went on for what felt like a couple of hours. It was pretty bad. A few hours after I calmed down I noticed a “ringing” in my head that I didn't pay much attention to at the time. Well, it's been three days, and it's still here. It's like a static noise that is constant, not TOO overwhelming (if I have the TV on, for instance, i can sort of ignore it) but still quite bad. 

Now, I was under the impression that tinnitus: 

1. Is ringing in the ears (left/right or both). Mine is inside my head, if that makes sense. I don't really feel it on either ear, but rather my brain. 

2. Is noise induced. In my case, the ringing is 100% NOT noise induced. I haven't listened to music in ages, and I don't live/work in a noisy environment. I know it can also be medication induced but again, I do not take any sort of medication. So the only logical explanation is that the constant state of anxiety/panic I was in caused this ringing. Is this possible? Can anxiety cause tinnitus? 

I have no idea whether I should see an ENT, GP, or just give it time... I don't want to sound desperate but the anxiety of NOT knowing what I'm dealing with here is making everything worse. I would really appreciate any sort of advice or help. Thank you.

,Anxietyhelp,"Anxious GI symptoms

31F, 8 months post partum, 2 months since I stopped breastfeeding, severe health anxiety 

On Zoloft 25 mg and have a mirena IUD 

I hope this post isn't too chaotic but for the past month my health anxiety was spiraling out of control about every little sensation, and I started Zoloft 25 mg exactly 2 weeks ago. I started having GI symptoms like nausea, upset stomach, and even vomiting. I didn't know if it was just anxiety related or a side effect. I moved my dose to the nighttime and it helped with that immensely. My anxiety was starting to feel better and I was doing great.

Last night I couldn't sleep and I randomly had diarrhea/ loose stools like 10 times. That stressed me out and triggered my health anxiety, I got heartburn and got nauseous and started dry heaving. Now I'm just a ball of anxiety and am so stressed, having chest pain, nausea continuing. I took a zofran and it helped a little.

My question is, do you think this is cancer or something sinister? I'm so scared to go to the doctor. Would the IUD be causing anxiety and/ or GI upset? I got it like 5 months ago. Idk what to do I'm so anxious and it's an endless cycle of nausea and anxiety.

This has started since I turned 19, or rather since my father turned 49. Both my parents are nearing 50. Some nights its worse than others and I can&amp;#39;t sleep without sobbing and shaking. Idk why this is happening but it&amp;#39;s ruining my life. I keep thinking how my parents just have around 30 years left and how they have already lived the majority of their life and how sad that is. And how little time I have left with them and how fast time seems to be moving. I can&amp;#39;t even comprehend we&amp;#39;re almost done with 2024- 30/40 years are gonna pass by in a blink at this rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need some serious advice. This has started to impact my thinking and studies. I no longer care about most things. Everything seems like a waste- what&amp;#39;s the point of studying or having a career when there is such a bigger issue around. I can&amp;#39;t focus on anything, and even friends seem not so important now.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi, I'm a college going student and my college is quite far away from my house. It's around 2.5 hours away and I have to commute as I do not have money to afford accomodation near college or get a hostel. 

When I am commuting, the only thought that goes in my mind is ""oh my god when will I reach college/home"" and I keep on counting every minute. This begins as soon as I leave my house. This thing has increased so much in the near past that I cannot do anything else and I cannot put my mind anywhere, only this thing keeps on going inside my head.

It has increased so much that I'm crying several times of the day thinking how I'll reach home late and if I'm going to get a seat to sit down in the metro while my way home or college. I have my exams and this thing is causing me more stress than my exams itself. 

People are laughing at me when I tell them this problem, but I can no longer take it and simply do not know why this is happening or how I can stop it. This is taking a serious toll on my mental and physical health. This is all i can think about these days and I can't even sleep. Somehow I'm not able to accept the fact that yes it takes time to reach.

It gets so bad that I even end up crying in front of my classmates and can't even control it once it starts, and everyone asks why I'm crying but I SIMPLY DONT KNOW. BUT ITS JUST HAPPENING.

However for the next few weeks i delt with it and continue living life. Then one night as i was walking to a train station after a packed football game the same symptoms however i learnt to control it quickly before it became worse.

,Anxietyhelp,"I have some social anxiety and a lot of performance/perfectionism based anxiety. 
I work as a retail manager and had to unload a warehouse truck when my schedule was changed around. I had some anxiety about it because I haven’t unloaded a truck a lot of times but the times I did do it, it turned out okay. Still, all day I could feel the anxiety build.
Then the truck driver shows up, shouting, grumbling, angry that “there was nobody that can unload the truck” even though I told him I will do it, he just needed to have some patience with me (I’m not even officially power jack trained nor did I have steel toes).
Me and him unloaded the truck together because he complained about being late but all the while he was grumbling, berating me, looking down on me and being generally rude and sarcastic to everything I said.

Then the truck driver shows up, shouting, grumbling, angry that “there was nobody that can unload the truck” even though I told him I will do it, he just needed to have some patience with me (I’m not even officially power jack trained nor did I have steel toes).
Me and him unloaded the truck together because he complained about being late but all the while he was grumbling, berating me, looking down on me and being generally rude and sarcastic to everything I said.

,Anxietyhelp,"This is my first Reddit post, I hope I may get some help as not sure where else to turn to. So, I have anxiety I went to the doctors in 2019 and they said I had GAD. I was in a bit of a state in the doctors and they said I had depression too. They put me on (I think 20mg) fluoxetine, and i tried this for about 2 weeks and it just felt horrible I felt like I was on speed or something like grinding my teeth all the time. So I came off them and then things sort of went a lot further downhill and I kind of had some kind of break down (I can’t remember a lot of what was happening at the time) and my mum dragged me to the doctors and they put me on quite strong mirtazipne, which helped with the insomnia. However, at the time I had a bit of a problem with taking Valium (bought from dealer, not prescription) and obviously they work wonders with anxiety and any medication the doctors gave me were not doing the same thing, so I stopped taking the mirtazipne. So fast forward to now, I’m off Valium and Xanax and everything and I’m doing ok-ish. But I do have a lot of anxiety in social situations still and really struggle with health anxiety. 
My question is, since I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember, it’s quite hard to tell what’s normal and I’m wondering a lot lately if my quality of life would improve if I went back on the SSRIs. At the moment, I’m really struggling with like going to the shops and just generally panicking quite a lot about my health and talking to people and such.

I (22f) moved across the world for a year on a working holiday and I’m currently living with some distant family members. There’s an event happening at a hostel near me and I want to go and check it out because I haven’t made any friends yet and I’ve been in this country for about a month. However, the thought of going makes me feel extremely anxious.

,Anxietyhelp,"This is the situation in a nutshell, using attachment theory to best describe both myself and my friend: I met my best friend last year and we grew closer pretty quickly. She visits me at my college. I visit her at her college, which takes hours by bus. Eventually, the two of us began texting very frequently. Multiple hours of texting every few days with Facetime, as well. I don’t Facetime or text almost anyone and the same goes for her. My anxious attachment really, really enjoys the intensity and frequency of communication – and, from what I gather now looking back, I assume the anxious part of her fearful avoidance attachment was activated. Both of us liked the arrangement. 

By this point, I’m learning a *lot* about her. She tells me things about her past relationships, showing me photos of people and herself. I tell her about my past, as well; I trust her very deeply, as I believe she does too. 

Eventually, I went on *vacation* with her to Italy over the summer, and when I arrived to spend time with her, my insecurities and fears of abandonment flared up severely. I began to feel jumpy, looking for signs that she loved and cared about me even though our relationship was as consistent as ever. I believe this happened because I was acutely aware that this friend is severely fearful avoidant, distancing herself at the first sign of trouble/when very upset, and yet we had gone almost an entire year without any conflicts which was big. Us going on vacation together also signified that this wasn’t just some surface-level connection I over-valued in my head: this was real, and we *were* that close. Realizing this made me lose my shit mentally and go into panic mode. 

Long story short, I freak out and begin to attempt to pry validation out of her unconsciously, growing increasingly upset when I wasn't receiving anything until I became very upset by what was meant to be a half-joking, half-uncomfortable (avoidant habit most likely) dismissal to someone asking if we were best friends. It was only after I was visibly upset that she admitted I was one of her closest friends. After that, we had a difficult conversation where I said I would like more verbal affirmation, using another friend of mine who we’re both best friends with as an example.

The vacation comes to an end, and she does say that it was nice to have me, which I appreciate - but things are off after I leave. At first, I chalked it up to both of us being busy, but she stopped sending me posts she finds funny or that remind her of me as I know she sends frequently to everyone. I tried to ignore this, believing my anxiety was making things up, and process my own mistakes on the trip. 

After two months, I tried to start a conversation where I apologized for my actions which I wasn’t even aware I was doing at the time. She says it’s okay, and she understands, but I continue over-apologizing. When she doesn’t answer for a week, I feel hurt, internalizing the silence as a form of abandonment/lack of care for my honesty (telling her I was ashamed and embarrassed of my actions), I text once more in a somewhat passive-aggressive tone suggesting we stop the conversation if she can’t handle it.

It’s now been three weeks of radio silence. I asked her boyfriend to check in on her, and apparently, she’s been upset with me the entire time without communicating this. I told her boyfriend I hadn’t even gotten the chance to ask if I made her upset before she deactivated and withdrew completely. He had a conversation with her and said that she agreed with almost everything he pointed out and that he ‘thinks’ she will talk to me but doesn’t know when. My other best friend who’s close with her also says that her silence is stupid and to not take her actions seriously, as I was only apologizing - but I feel incredibly guilty for having done what I did during the summer without even being aware. I’m incredibly scared she’s going to not return and not allow me to show her that I see my mistakes and won’t overstep her boundaries again. 

Everyone I’ve spoken to about this believes she’ll come around, but I’m finding it very hard to believe in this as the time continues to pass. It’s about to be a month soon and I miss her a lot. She sends me photos daily on Snapchat, as this is an important thing for her, and I’m trying to see that as a piece of consistency that is telling of her return, but I feel like I’m going stir-crazy just sitting and waiting for our conversation to resume. I also feel angry that she would do this to me as I’m quite literally attempting to take accountability for my actions. I just don’t understand her actions and it’s all overwhelming me. 

So, yeah. I’m trying very hard to be patient with her because I love her a lot but this hurts and I don’t want her to leave.

,Anxietyhelp,"I am 17 f. I don’t usually do this type of thing, but I am at a total loss.

For context, my anxiety really started getting bad this past summer. I am a hypochondriac, so almost every week I’d have a new symptom that would send me spiraling. My health anxiety turned into existential anxiety, and now I am starting to get depressed as well. Unfortunately, I’ve turned to SH as a way to get some kind of relief. 

I used to be an avid gym goer, and around the same time, I was going to therapy. I started the gym early winter of last year, and would go with my mom. She isn’t allowing me to drive despite me begging to do so, so when she stopped going, I had to as well. The gym was my life. It might sound silly, but I could spend hours in there. Once that was off the table, the SH started. Therapy was a big help too (not specifically for health anxiety, that hadn’t started yet), but my therapist switched offices. After being ripped away from the gym and therapy, my health anxiety started. Ever since then, my mind has become hell. I’m constantly thinking I’m dying, thinking about how much of a failure I am, and how I’d be better off not around since I’m so miserable. I’ve tried telling my mom, and although she’s supportive, she isn’t getting me back to the gym or in therapy like I’ve been begging. My anxiety has been paralyzing me every day. I lay in bed for hours after school and work to distract myself. Im terrified of dying, but terrified of living. I’m so disappointed in myself for my lack of motivation and drive. I just want to want to live again. If I’m not deathly anxious, I’m severely depressed. I am currently on buspar, but if anything, I feel more depressed than anxious now. I feel the need to cry all the time. I just can’t live with this mind anymore. I guess what I’m truly asking is for some advice- anything that maybe helped you or would help someone in my position. I don’t have a lot of friends, but do have a really good relationship with my family. I just don’t want to burden anyone I care for with these miserable feelings.

I’ve tried telling my mom, and although she’s supportive, she isn’t getting me back to the gym or in therapy like I’ve been begging. My anxiety has been paralyzing me every day. I lay in bed for hours after school and work to distract myself. Im terrified of dying, but terrified of living. I’m so disappointed in myself for my lack of motivation and drive. I just want to want to live again. If I’m not deathly anxious, I’m severely depressed. I am currently on buspar, but if anything, I feel more depressed than anxious now. I feel the need to cry all the time. I just can’t live with this mind anymore. I guess what I’m truly asking is for some advice- anything that maybe helped you or would help someone in my position. I don’t have a lot of friends, but do have a really good relationship with my family. I just don’t want to burden anyone I care for with these miserable feelings. Apologies for the long post, but thank you if you took the time to read this. I know it’s not very uplifting.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"For about a year I’ve been dealing with this weird version of anxiety that comes with eating/drinking. I want to gain weight but eating too much gives me anxiety. I’ve tried constantly eating a little throughout the day to hit my calorie count but it consistently ruins my day.

,Anxietyhelp,"Around two years ago, my anxiety started getting really bad. I was constantly nauseous and could hear my heartbeat 24/7, it felt like I was always about to throw up and I'd just run up three flights of stairs. I was always exhausted because it took so much energy to function with my nervous system being on such constant high alert all the time. 

I also consistently threw up my food (WITHOUT TRYING) after and during almost every meal, gagging constantly whenever I tried to swallow a bite of food. ecause of the constant nausea, I lost all the pleasure of eating. It became a situation where I would try to cram as many calories into my body in the smallest quantity as possible because it was physically painful/exhausting for me to eat. I would take 30mg of Hydroxozine (a sleeping med) and ondansetron hcl (an anti nausea med for chemotherapy patients) before every meal, and it would only prevent vomiting half the time. Throughout that time, I lost around 20-25 lbs, getting to around 100 lbs as an adult woman. It was horrible -- I looked skeletal. I was starving to death.

2024 was my first year in a while where I became free of this. I gained my weight back, I got the joy of eating back, but I'm constantly afraid that it could come back with no warning, and I don't feel too sure I could make it through another time.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey all. I am not sure whether this is the correct sub to post something like this but I figured since I panicked the past 3 weeks with no end I might aswell try it here:

So about 3 weeks ago, I was a bit constipated. Nothing too serious. Just less coming out than I was expecting. But this already sent me into a deep spiral where I worried about cancer. Fast forward about a week later, where I had to get up at 7 am regularly now (instead of my usual 9 am the 2 months prior). On that day I had very loose stools. Not diarrhea, but still very loose and ""Shapeless"". And this spiked my anxiety. For that coming week, I went to the bathroom observed my stool and worried almost all day long. Fast forward to the weekend of that week and I began to develop a loss of appetite. And this sent me into absolute panic mode. I started to google and read and I was absolutely 100% convinced I had cancer and was about to die.

I went to the GP twice who told me it might be a viral infection or a bacterial infection caused by food (because I ate something from outside the weekend before the loos stools) and so he prescribed antibiotics which I took. He told me the situation would get better by thursday. Saw no improvement so I panicked and went to the GP again and broke down crying, 100% convinced its cancer. He asked me a bunch of questions and living circumstances and then sent me off telling me he does not think it is cancer.

So, fast forward to today, I am still in panic mode continuously for 3 weeks now. I force myself to eat and each BM i have is softer than what I am used to.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi all, 

I've been suffering with a mix of genralized anxiety disorder (GAD), depression, and depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR) for almost two months. I had an episode similar 7 years ago and I can't remember how long it lasted or how I managed to get rid of it. I know this time it was triggered due to prolonged stress from work, school, and family issues. I have been living in a nightmare for almost two months and can't get any relied. Turning on social media for the first time to help with any suggestions.   
  
I have a primary care provider that has checked all my bloodwork resulting in only a vitamin d defficiency. My phsychiatrist who recommended to focus on sleep as much as possible. Trying to get 7-8 hours is our goal. I also tried theraphy but I did not get benefits from it from two different therapists. 

For supplements I take magnesium glycitate, ashwaghandha, fish oil, and multivitamins. 

Here's a quick timeline and my test results and hope someone out there can find a pattern to stop this feeling. It is a shot in the dark but I am desperate as every day is hell and only get relief when it's bed time. 

August 15, 2024: Issue started. It had been lingering for a while but this is the day I finally broke down and fear took over. 

August 18th, 2024: Started Lexapro 10 MG medication. Daily Hydroxizine 25 MG and 5 MG Ambien to sleep daily. Didn't see much improvement on Lexapro after 4 weeks and talked to my phychiatrist about it. 

September 20th, 2024: Switched to Prozac 20 MG medication. 

October 7, 2024: It's been a few weeks on Prozac and I feel the anxiety calming down but I am having mood swings. Based on the gene testing, my phychiatrists says my ANK3 gene could be the issue. They're putting me on 25mg of Lamotrigine (Lamictal) to try to fix this. 

  
During this journey, I have discovered that having a set routine, exercising, meditation, and socializing is the best way to help with the anxiety and having the endless thoughts. The book Hope and Help for your nerver by Dr Claire Weekes helped me understand this is a response from my anxiety. The dp manual by Shaun also put me at ease. 

  
During my research on ANK3 I found that it could be linked with bipolar disorder, which one of the therapists did think I had. The Gene CACNA1C on my lab results also showed a strange result that my phsyciatrist was facinated by.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been suffering with a mix of genralized anxiety disorder (GAD), depression, and depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR) for almost two months. I had an episode similar 7 years ago and I can&amp;#39;t remember how long it lasted or how I managed to get rid of it. I know this time it was triggered due to prolonged stress from work, school, and family issues. I have been living in a nightmare for almost two months and can&amp;#39;t get any relied. Turning on social media for the first time to help with any suggestions.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a primary care provider that has checked all my bloodwork resulting in only a vitamin d defficiency. My phsychiatrist who recommended to focus on sleep as much as possible. Trying to get 7-8 hours is our goal. I also tried theraphy but I did not get benefits from it from two different therapists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For supplements I take magnesium glycitate, ashwaghandha, fish oil, and multivitamins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a quick timeline and my test results and hope someone out there can find a pattern to stop this feeling. It is a shot in the dark but I am desperate as every day is hell and only get relief when it&amp;#39;s bed time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August 15, 2024: Issue started. It had been lingering for a while but this is the day I finally broke down and fear took over. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August 18th, 2024: Started Lexapro 10 MG medication. Daily Hydroxizine 25 MG and 5 MG Ambien to sleep daily. Didn&amp;#39;t see much improvement on Lexapro after 4 weeks and talked to my phychiatrist about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 20th, 2024: Switched to Prozac 20 MG medication. &lt;/p&gt;

I catch myself thinking a lot about time and it feels like I am getting ild and I have not accomplished anything and I don’t know where to get started, especially in this job market.

My personal recovery experience is proof of this. After medication and psychotherapy failed to help, I turned to a combination of a scientifically tailored diet, regular exercise, and nutritional supplements, and I fully recovered within 8 months. While medication and psychotherapy remain the primary treatments for anxiety disorders, research indicates that nearly half of patients do not respond to these methods. This has led many to seek alternative therapies. Numerous studies have demonstrated that diet and exercise, as key components of alternative treatments, are highly effective in managing emotional disorders.\n\nFirstly, a healthy diet has a highly beneficial impact on depression and anxiety.\n\n**Anti-inflammatory Foods:**\n\nResearch suggests a significant link between chronic inflammation and depression. An anti-inflammatory diet, such as the Mediterranean diet rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, and healthy fats, can improve emotional well-being by reducing systemic inflammation. A 2019 systematic review conducted by Katie Tolkien and colleagues highlighted that anti-inflammatory foods help alleviate depressive symptoms. The study found a correlation between pro-inflammatory diets and an increased risk of depression. Adopting an anti-inflammatory diet is an effective intervention or preventive measure for reducing the risk and symptoms of depression.\n\n(Katie Tolkien, Steven Bradburn, Chris Murgatroyd, *An anti-inflammatory diet as a potential intervention for depressive disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis*, Clinical Nutrition, Volume 38, Issue 5, 2019, Pages 2045-2052, ISSN 0261-5614, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.11.007.)\n\n**Gut-Brain Axis Research:**\n\nThe gut microbiota is closely related to brain function and emotional regulation. By improving the balance of gut microbiota, mental health can be enhanced. Research on the gut-brain axis and mental health is abundant, and a 2019 review published in *Annals of Medicine* pointed out that the gut microbiota plays a key role in regulating the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin. By improving diet and supplementing with probiotics, it is possible to reduce gut-related inflammatory responses and improve mood.\n\n(Halverson, T., &amp; Alagiakrishnan, K. (2020). *Gut microbes in neurocognitive and mental health disorders.* Annals of Medicine, 52(8), 423–443. https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2020.1808239)\n\n**Role of Omega-3 Fatty Acids:**  \nA meta-analysis published in [*Translational Psychiatry*](https://www.nature.com/tp) found that Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA (a major component of fish oil), have a significant effect on alleviating depressive symptoms. The study suggests that Omega-3 can reduce brain inflammation and regulate neurotransmitter function, thus helping to relieve depression and anxiety.\n\n(Liao, Y., Xie, B., Zhang, H.\xa0*et al.*\xa0Efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs in depression: A meta-analysis.\xa0*Transl Psychiatry*\xa09, 190 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-019-0515-5)\n\n**Vitamins and Minerals:**\n\nDeficiencies in nutrients such as vitamin D, B vitamins, magnesium, and zinc are closely related to depressive symptoms. Vitamin D is not only beneficial for the immune system but also affects areas of the brain responsible for mood regulation. Studies have shown that supplementing with vitamin D can reduce depressive symptoms. Magnesium plays a key role in neurotransmission, and low magnesium levels are linked to mood disorders. A systematic review conducted by Anglin in 2013 found that vitamin D deficiency is strongly associated with depressive symptoms, and supplementing with vitamin D helps improve mood. Research by Tarleton and Littenberg in 2018 indicated that magnesium intake significantly improves symptoms of depression and anxiety, particularly in individuals with magnesium deficiencies, where supplementation effectively stabilizes mood.\n\n(Anglin, R. E. S., Samaan, Z., Walter, S. D., &amp; McDonald, S. D. (2013). Vitamin D deficiency and depression in adults: Systematic review and meta-analysis. *The British Journal of Psychiatry*, 202(2), 100-107. doi:10.1192/bjp.bp.111.106666)\n\n(Tarleton, E. K., &amp; Littenberg, B. (2015). Magnesium intake and depression in adults. *Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine*, 28(2), 249-256. doi:10.3122/jabfm.2015.02.140176)\n\nExercise also has significant and undeniable effects on depression and anxiety.\n\n**Exercise and Depression:**\n\nA large-scale study published in *The Lancet Psychiatry* found that regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise, significantly reduces the incidence of depression. The research analyzed data from over 1.2 million people and concluded that even light physical activity can substantially improve mental health.\n\n(Association between physical exercise and mental health in 1·2 million individuals in the USA between 2011 and 2015: a cross-sectional study Chekroud, Sammi R et al. The Lancet Psychiatry, Volume 5, Issue 9, 739 - 746)\n\n**Promoting Neuronal Growth (Aerobic Exercise and BDNF):**\n\nAerobic exercise can stimulate the hippocampus, a brain region closely associated with memory and emotional regulation, and enhance the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This, in turn, helps repair damaged neurons and promote the formation of new neural connections. A 2015 study by Kristin L. Szuhany et al. found that regular exercise increases BDNF levels, particularly in the hippocampus, contributing to better mood regulation and neuroplasticity. The study demonstrated that the increase in BDNF is directly associated with improvements in symptoms of depression and anxiety. This supports the idea that exercise can serve as a natural and effective means of enhancing mental health by promoting neural growth.\n\n(Kristin L. Szuhany, [Matteo Bugatti](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Bugatti%20M%5BAuthor%5D),and\xa0[Michael W. Otto](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Otto%20MW%5BAuthor%5D) (2015). *A meta-analytic review of the effects of exercise on brain-derived neurotrophic factor.* Journal of Psychiatric Research, 60, 56-64.)\n\n**Stress Relief:**\n\nResearch by Hillman et al. (2008) demonstrated that consistent physical activity results in lower cortisol levels and increased resilience to stress. Participants who engaged in regular aerobic exercise experienced a reduction in stress-induced anxiety and depressive symptoms, further underscoring the role of exercise in managing mental health.\n\n(Hillman, C. H., Erickson, K. I., &amp; Kramer, A. F. (2008). Be smart, exercise your heart: Exercise effects on brain and cognition. *Nature Reviews Neuroscience*, 9(1), 58-65. doi:10.1038/nrn2298)\n\nThe research highlighted above is just the tip of the iceberg. Compared to traditional drug treatments for anxiety, much of the research on diet and exercise remains in the laboratory and meta-analysis stages, with relatively few clinical trials. However, current findings confirm that exercise and diet have clear benefits for alleviating anxiety.

My personal recovery experience is proof of this. After medication and psychotherapy failed to help, I turned to a combination of a scientifically tailored diet, regular exercise, and nutritional supplements, and I fully recovered within 8 months. While medication and psychotherapy remain the primary treatments for anxiety disorders, research indicates that nearly half of patients do not respond to these methods. This has led many to seek alternative therapies. Numerous studies have demonstrated that diet and exercise, as key components of alternative treatments, are highly effective in managing emotional disorders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly, a healthy diet has a highly beneficial impact on depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-inflammatory Foods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Research suggests a significant link between chronic inflammation and depression. An anti-inflammatory diet, such as the Mediterranean diet rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, and healthy fats, can improve emotional well-being by reducing systemic inflammation.

,Anxietyhelp,"I’m a 23-year-old woman with a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering, currently pursuing a master’s in bio- and chemical engineering. While it may seem impressive to have achieved this at a relatively young age, I often feel hopeless. I didn’t pass an exam last semester, which means I have to retake it this semester, and I worry that I will fail again. If that happens, I fear that the last two years of my education will have been wasted.

Additionally, I’m anxious about my job prospects. I feel like I lack practical experience, and I’m concerned that companies will only hire candidates with a significant background in the field.

While it may seem impressive to have achieved this at a relatively young age, I often feel hopeless. I didn’t pass an exam last semester, which means I have to retake it this semester, and I worry that I will fail again. If that happens, I fear that the last two years of my education will have been wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"I, 19(F), had kind of a rough time obtaining my drivers license. I started learning how to drive when I was 15 and I started off very eager. The problem was, I was a really bad driver. When I was doing my 50 hours of behind the wheel driving, my dad made me do the first 25 hours just in my neighborhood. I think that really tanked my confidence as a driver because it went on for almost a year. 

When I was 17, I gained some of that confidence back and attempted my driving test. I ended up failing it two times and the second time really affected me. I was so frustrated that it was taking me so long to learn how to drive when I had friends becoming expert drivers at 16. By the third attempt, when I was 18, I passed my test but I truly think it was because instructor pity passed me.

I don’t think I ever got over failing my test that second time as I’ve had severe drivers anxiety ever since. Now it’s been a year with my license and the only places I drive to are to school and that’s always accompanied by a family member. I get anxiety whenever there are too many cars on the road and I feel my heart plummet whenever there’s a car tailgating me. It also doesn’t help that I’m still kind not the best driver and can barely park. I’m yet to drive myself alone anywhere. 

It’s become a problem now because I just found a part time job that pays really well, is only a half hour from my school, and is honestly the perfect fit for me. But I could not bring myself to apply for the job because the thought of driving there by myself makes me so anxious. I was basically forced to apply for the job by my mother and I had two mental breakdowns in the process. When I got the email this morning that my application was being reviewed, I felt so sick to my stomach and was in a mental freeze for hours. 

I’m so tired of feeling so scared and anxious and I want to move on with my life. I’m the only one in my friends groups that doesn’t drive. I’m avoiding social gatherings now because I don’t want to be that friend that has to wait for a ride. I’m also the only one without a job because I’m too afraid to actually drive there.

I am in therapy and have been for many years , I got my borderline diagnose about 6 years ago and made the mistake of going on forums to learn more about what exactly borderline means. 

I have been met with comments such as ""they are not worth the time"" ""you can't trust them"" ""they will hurt you and enjoy it"" ""they have no empathy and I will never even entertaine getting to know someone with borderline"" ""they should just not exist, all they do is ruin people"" and these are just a few of the most common comments. 

I have heard the horror stories about us and what we are capable of and it gives me so much anxiety that maybe I am also someone worth hating? 

I work hard on being kind and regulating my feelings and I have never hurt anyone, being aware of how I am and what I suffer from I usually ask for a minute and step away before my emotions take over. I avoid alcohol and drugs and try to be vigilant on thinking before feeling. 

The hate towards us with borderline has become overbearing for me and I feel anxious every day, feeling like I am just a pure evil to the world. 

If you have borderline, how do you cope with it?

,Anxietyhelp,"hi there! for starter - im diagnosed with gad, agoraphobia and cptsd. we strongly think that i might have ocd but thats not on paper yet, so i wont say that i have it.

sometimes, i get this weird, overwhelming feeling that im forgetting something.
my head is so loud, theres so much happening *constantly* and my memory is horrible.
i truly do be forgetting things but i always eventually remember them and do them - late but at least i do them!
but sometimes, theres this weird feeling that im forgetting something but i have no idea what.

,Anxietyhelp,Does anyone else think about death and fear it ? I mean to where it keeps you up at night and floats through your daily thoughts like it just belongs in the loop. In the last year and a half I have had time where I think about death and how much it scares me and every scenario in my head plays like a broken record. Records of how I could die tonight and how would everyone feel about that or what if I get into a car accident all those scenarios. It even scares me more when I jump on Facebook or and media platform and you see that someone has passed away old or even my age. It plays in my head. Usually it goes away and I can’t think about other stuff but lately after my hectic month and dealing with this weird sensation in my chest I think about it more and how much it scares me. It is to the point where I am afraid to even go to bed and I get so scared but I know I need proper sleep because I have been lacking in that department for a good month or so since I moved and had my wedding. I have been trying to avoid the thought but each time I sink deeper and it scares me even more. I tell myself nothing will happen and I will grow old with my husband but most days now I can’t relax at the idea. Every night before I fall asleep I ask my husband “am I going to die tonight” and he tells me “no you aren’t” and I am starting to feel bad in the department of him having to help me but he’s been a huge support.

Everyday, I feel like I’m having a mental break and it just gets worse and worse.

&lt;p&gt;I have been a teacher for the last three years. The school that I was at traumatized me so much with their high expectations and never ending workload, so I decided to switch schools. My new school environment is great, but I feel even worse now than I did before. I have panic attacks everyday before going to work. I physically cannot get anything done because I feel like I’m being weighed down by stress and anxiety. I’m worried about my physical health, especially since I am a diabetic. There are days when I cannot bring myself to eat at all and days when I stress eat into oblivion. I’m worried about my mental health. Everyday, I feel like I’m having a mental break and it just gets worse and worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason I am still teaching is because my master’s program requires fieldwork. I have this semester and next semester and I’m done! I don’t know if I can make it that long.

,Anxietyhelp,"s the title says. Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I moved a year ago and had my second appointment with my OBGYN recently. I called the office last week and told them I’m going on a flight soon (next week) and wanted to request some anti anxiety meds to help. 

Quick backstory, my previous doc in my previous state when asked about this gave me 10 0.5 mg lorazepams for my flight. She wanted me to have extra in case of connecting flights and of course some to get back. 

I showed up at the pharmacy and saw that my total was 16 cents and there was ONE PILL. It was 1mg lorazepam. Am I right for feeling mad? Like she’s not taking into consideration that I have a flight back home let alone if there are connecting flights. Why is she being so stingy? 

I have my primary care physician appointment on Tuesday. Can I tell them the situation and see if they’ll prescribe me more? I don’t want to look like I’m doctor shopping but I’m stunned that my OBGYN gave me ONE pill. Never had a history of abuse.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi all,

I'm like 90% sure I don't have GAD, but my job has been really rough lately. I'm juggling way too many chainsaws, and the thought of dropping one if them is starting to make me sick. The problem is, I knew what I signed up for, and I'm getting paid to do exactly what I'm doing. This isn't a case of being overworked- it's a case of a demanding job that pays me well.

I've been starting to mentally take my work home with me. I'm struggling to sleep, and have resorted to snacking on small things to keep my food down.

This isn't the first time this has happened, and I know that when things calm down a bit, this will go away.

Is this something that would be helped by some temporary pharmaceuticals? I don't see it as an anxiety disorder, because I'm very vividly aware of the cause and know it's only temporary. Unfortunately, knowing these things isn't helping me eat or sleep.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey guys,

I live in FL and we’re getting ready to be hit by at least a Cat 3 hurricane.

I’ve been through many hurricanes before, i’ve lived here my entire life and Ian was the worst one i’ve been through and it has given me extreme anxiety about storms and hurricanes.

I’m not scared of not having power for days or anything like that. It’s during the storm that scares me. During Ian it sounded like the roof was gonna get ripped off.

This time we’re most likely putting boards on our windows and we have generators and plenty of food and water. As far as i know we’re not in a major flood zone.

I’m just scared, more like terrified. I hate the sound of the wind and the unknown. especially seeing what happened in north FL / GA / TN and NC with helene. It’s giving me unbearable anxiety and i don’t know how to calm myself down.

Before you suggest leaving, I can’t. I live with my mom and her fiancé and we have a very aggressive dog who hates people and other animals. We have no where to bring him, plus the surrounding states are destroyed from Helene. We’ve stayed every other time and end up being fine. I just hate it.

I guess what i really need is advice or reassurance or anything to help me have some piece of mind.

I’m also starting to worry about the aftermath like with work and school. If there’s no power i’m not gonna be able to sleep AT ALL for work because i have sleeping issues already, so if im not PERFECTLY comfortable it’s almost impossible.

I would like to address something anonymously.

A year ago, I developed Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS), which led to severe panic attacks. I’m in treatment and learning to cope with it, but I still often have moments when the symptoms get worse and I feel overwhelmed with fear. These situations often arise when I’m dating someone or talking to new people. I always hide the anxiety because, unfortunately, the world expects us to function “normally.”

My girlfriend left me back then when I started having panic attacks because she said my “baggage” was too “heavy” for her, and many friends found it strange that I ended up in a psychiatric clinic afterward. I find it exhausting that I have to suppress my emotions and can’t simply express what’s going on inside me.

I just don’t want to be alone, and I know that if I show my true self, I’ll be left behind. But this constant pretending is so incredibly draining that after two hours around people, even though I’m naturally extroverted, I can’t handle it anymore and just want to be alone again so I can give my fear the space it needs and let it out.

I’m asking for tips and help.

Ive been struggling with Anxiety for about a year now. It was quite bad, however i started to eat better, added more exercise, started eating better etc.. Its still there but its much better now.

This is also accompanied by shortness of breath and a small anxiety attack afterwards. My grandparents are both doctors, not heart doctors but i had the Chance to consult this with them and got the examinatons they said is should get (EKG, Holter device, bloodwork) - everything ok.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey everyone, I’m really desperate for advice here because I’m freaking out.

For the past 5-6 months, I’ve been prescribed Ativan for my insomnia, panic attacks, and anxiety. It has completely turned my life around – I take it exactly as prescribed, and it has made such a huge difference. But during my last appointment with my PCP, she started pushing me to switch to antidepressants. I’m absolutely against this because my close family has had horrible experiences with them, and I don’t want to go down that road.

The worst part is, she only gave me a 1-month supply of Ativan instead of the usual 3 months, and I have this sinking feeling that she’s not going to prescribe it again. I’ve been panicking about what to do because this medication is the only thing that’s worked for me. Without it, I honestly don’t know how I’ll cope with the anxiety and panic attacks.

I’ve been looking into telehealth psychiatrists, hoping they can help me continue my prescription. But I’m so scared they’ll just try to push antidepressants on me too, and that I won’t be able to get Ativan anymore. I’ve never done telehealth before, so I don’t know how it works. Can I just explain my situation to them and ask if they can prescribe it? Do they need my medical records, or does my PCP have to know?

I feel like I’m running out of options and the thought of losing my Ativan is terrifying. It’s the only thing that’s helped me live a normal life, and I don’t want to go back to constant panic attacks that make me feel like I’m dying.

My parents separated when I was about four years old and live well over 1,000 km apart from eachother, they get along and are happy, they consider themselves friends even.

,Anxietyhelp,"I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for many years now, and I’ve started to reach a stage where I’m trying to work through it and intervene more (because quite frankly I’m bored of being anxious all the time).
I attended CBT and found the mindfulness techniques useful to an extent, mainly for panic attacks, but personally I didn’t feel like it helped with the thought processes, because how am I supposed to actively ground myself every second of the day right? At least for me, it was a real struggle. I’ve spent years on antidepressants too, and still found myself with the same thought processes.
Recently I’ve attempted to break down the components of my anxiety in a bid to analyse them with logical thought, so I thought I’d share some of them in case it helps anyone else reframe their thought patterns. I know it’s a massively complex subject, and everyone’s experience differs as it’s shaped by their individual life experience, so I’m not trying to ‘fix’ anything, but instead provide some alternative thinking points perhaps.
I don’t want to make the post super long that you lose focus, but I also have a lot to say, so I apologise if it reaches novel length!

Worrying about the future - We cannot predict the future, there are too many variables that could occur. My anxiety forces me to the negative variables, the ‘what ifs’. My intervention is to start considering the positive variables too, because if all these ‘bad things’ could happen, there’s just as much probability that good things could happen, so logically, you have to factor those in too. 
In a similar theme, the same can be said about regret, I regret not doing ‘x’, because ‘y’ would have happened. How do you know? That timeline doesn’t exist, so how could you possibly know it would have been a more positive outcome? As strange an exercise as it may be, if you regret anything, try factoring in some negative variables that could have happened instead! It’s funny how we factor in these pretend negative scenarios for looking forward, and pretend positive scenarios for looking back, as if we really know what would happen either way! 

Guilt and shame - Ok this is really tricky, and I’m actually still trying to work through this. I’ve made a bit of progress over some of my actions in the past, primarily working on forgiving myself but It. Is. Difficult. Living with depression, for me, came with some poor life choices, and I have to live with that. What has happened in the past is out of my control, I cannot change it, but how I analyse my decisions has helped me reframe my guilt and shame. 
If a past decision yielded a negative outcome, and the primary decision was made with good intentions, or at the very least it was the best decision you could make at the time, you cannot continue to beat yourself up for that negative outcome. What was not intended should not be a cross to bear for life. Man, I have beaten myself up for some poor decisions for so many years, but how many years are enough? Be realistic, if a lesson has been learned, and you no longer align with those decisions morally, it really is time to let go. 

Above all else, it’s not your fault your mind works the way it does. Your anxious brain is misfiring, and the region that processes emotion and fear does not regulate properly, rendering the logical section of your brain less effective. Remember, the logical section is there still, even if it doesn’t feel like it. You may not be able to control your mind starting to spiral, but you have absolute control over the logic you apply to it when you clock what it’s doing. See it for what it is, and practice applying logic where you can. 

Another way of looking at it is that the past and future quite literally do not exist in the present moment. Ruminating over historical events, or worrying about the possibility of future events is a fruitless torture of your present self. I have lost years being in my own head, I haven’t been truly ‘present’ for a long time, I’ve always been looking forward or looking back. I can’t stress this enough, give yourself a break. You deserve to be present, allow yourself time just living in the present moment, even if it’s just a tiny bit to begin with. You’ll be surprised how quiet it is.

Also, I feel like it’s important to say that I’ve been processing my anxiety/depression in a safe environment, and even then it’s been difficult on occasion to ground myself back in reality. This post isn’t about encouraging you to deep dive, you do that on your own timeline when you’re ready, it’s about offering a different perspective.

   Growing up I wasn't like this...I could speak freely, engage with my peers and all cause I didn't know what fear is . I started developing this habit of not looking people in the eye cause of my dad's   habit of telling me never to look him in the eye when he's talking to me cause to him it's ""disrespectful and I'm challenging him"" he also told the young 10 year old me to stop having the habit of wanting to go outside to play and I should stay indoors, presently he now questions why i dont have the habit of going out.. Over the years the habit of not living my room grew on me. My mum couldn't even do anything cause my dad's anger knew no bound...there are good times when we are together as a family and just enjoying the company of my other siblings. but there's always this troubling feeling like everything could go wrong or we might say something that triggers our parents to be angry and shout on us. Borderline we couldn't be ourselves...
I won't really blame my sister for dishing out her anger on me cause she was also stressed out but what I can't really forgive is my mum letting all these happen so that peace will once again reign. Being the first born took a turn on my sis and growing up, I knew she had it all worse. I'm sure she was angry cause the young me didn't get all the treatment she had received...so the only way to cope was to retaliate back at me by screaming and sometimes throwing things at me...she's different now I know...and we still vibe but I can't be close to her like I want to.

The feeling that I'm about to break down still can't go away...I know people have recommended talking it out with ur family ...you can't talk to a parent that tells you ""I can say what I want to say to you cause I'm your mother"" or ""talking to me is not a conversation but a command""
   I won't lie, when I'm financially stable, I'd reduce the contact i have with my family and treat ""these feelings better"".

My Neighbor banged hard on my wall and spam ring my doorbell.

&lt;p&gt;I start my treatment on monday, I can’t wait to have access to medication that can help me. This sleep anxiety/panic is really scary for me and I’m convinced I somehow have brain damage/a tumor/etc. This sucks. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"I’ve personally had OCD for 8 years and was misdiagnosed with generalized anxiety multiple times. It’s frustrating because **the treatment for anxiety and OCD is NOT the same.** In fact, regular CBT can often make OCD symptoms worse.

I’ve been dealing with anxiety for the past 15 years and it has been crippling. I have been on multiple medications and none have seemed to help. Currently I am taking Duloxetine and I am going to ask to be weened off of it at my next appointment because I do not believe it has done anything.


Recently I got into a relationship for the first time after 2 years of being single. I love my boyfriend to death and he is the most supportive man I have ever met. The only issue is I feel like I have become increasingly anxious over the past few months. This looming fear of him leaving me and or lying to me is excruciating. It doesn’t help that I am constantly anxious about everything else in life which causes me to breakdown when I’m with him and have anxiety attacks. Now this is not every-time I’ve seen him but it has been increasing. For a bit of context I am a paramedic and these past few weeks I have dealt with some difficult calls as well. I struggle with talking to him about that because I don’t want him to think my job is going to be an ongoing issue for me. I love my job but some days it can be taxing.

So lil story..

Today I was supposed to have a first time doctors appointment for my anxiety and help get medicated. For context, I had this appointment scheduled two weeks ago but it got canceled so I rescheduled. I show up at the door at on the dot 2pm, ready and a bit excited to feel the relief, until the front door was locked. I’m like hm okay maybe they’re the type of place that keep them locked and you need to call to be let in. I called and was on hold for 10 minutes.. nobody responded. So I tried to call a few other locations of the same company but was still on hold! At this point I go to my car… and start having an anxiety attack😭. I was crying and so mad like I was looking forward to this appointment and thought I might be getting scammed or something since I’ve never been to there before. I left a voicemail trying to keep my composure but I was obviously crying/ tearing up in it LOL and said “I’m so confused why nobody’s here, I got no heads up on any cancellation wtf blah blah blah”. I even left a lil note in the door saying “Im so confused why nobody’s answering when I had an appointment today, please call me back at (insert phone number).” 

Once I get back to my car one location calls me back.. and tells me.. my appointment is actually on Monday. BRO I FEEL SO CRAZY NOW! I checked the email again and I don’t know WHYY I thought my appointment was on Saturday these whole last couple days when it’s actually on Monday. Why did I even schedule it at that day, I have class??  Bro I don’t even want to deal with rescheduling again atm I’ll do it tmr or just miss class idk bruh😭. I just feel insane.. like why does my body react like this? It’s so hard for me to keep my composure in frustrating situations like why do I cry and lash out? And it makes me feel especially stupid now because it’s MY FAULT! 

And I left that stupid note in the door, so now they’re gonna be like “what’s dis crazy gal talkin bout?” 

And part of me is so scared they won’t help me with getting medicated now because I seem unhinged or something. 

How’d I even get to dis point bruh, any advice yall got? This situation has honestly gotten me so anxious now about how ill be judged for the opportunity to be medicated.

Hello, today I had an incident with a school bus. So I was headed to meet a family member to pick something up this afternoon, I was driving in a neighbourhood and was coming up into a four way intersection and see a school bus coming up the same road just on the other side. They had no lights or stop pulled out or anything they look like they are about to turn right and continue on down that street so not thinking anything about it I proceed forward as like I said they had no indication that they were stopping to let kids off so I assumed they were turning right as that’s what it looked like he was doing and I’m not aware that it’s a bus stop area so as I just proceed and enter the intersection the bus driver then decides he’s going to come to a complete stop and pull out the stop sign and get ready to let kids off. I’m right in the middle of the intersection and I panic cause I obviously know that you’re not supposed to pass by a bus with their lights on and stop sign out but you’re also not supposed to stop in the middle of an intersection so I pull slightly to the right and head to the start of the sidewalk/curb on my side so I’m out of the intersection and stopping for the bus. As I’m pulling over the bus driver hasn’t even opened the door or let kids off or anything and just waving his hands like there is a shark in the water freaking out for me to stop and I start getting heated and start yelling that I’m fucking stopping. Three kids finally get off and as he’s about to pull away he’s glaring at me and being all nasty and of course I’m pissed off at this point and just mouth off to him and getting angry and I was about to flip him off but held back. I’m a mom myself whose kid rides the school bus I’m not stupid, I also just left the hospital as I’m 7 months pregnant and just finished a 3 hour glucose testing which I had to fast for, plus a full bladder so I was extra agitated. I also suffer from extreme anxiety as I have an anxiety disorder so anytime something happens I dwell and get really worked up over even the smallest things, it’s really hard. After the anger subsided I was immediately overcome with emotions and just called my husband and cried on the phone to tell him what happened and just mixed with anger and sadness and stressed. Beating myself up trying to figure out what I did wrong what I should have done and then confusion. I included a picture and the red circle is where I stopped for the bus, he waited till I was in the middle of the intersection before stopping and pulling the stop sign out and I know you can’t sit in an intersection so just wondering what your opinion is and what you would have done. My husband says I did the right thing and just to fuck him and don’t dwell on it, as I stated I have anxiety on top of pregnancy hormones and this really really upset me. Also now paranoid that police will come for me cause I know buses can forward license plates to police. Just any reassurance would be great or advice or any of your own nightmare bus or driving stories I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. (This occurred in Alberta, Canada.

They had no lights or stop pulled out or anything they look like they are about to turn right and continue on down that street so not thinking anything about it I proceed forward as like I said they had no indication that they were stopping to let kids off so I assumed they were turning right as that’s what it looked like he was doing and I’m not aware that it’s a bus stop area so as I just proceed and enter the intersection the bus driver then decides he’s going to come to a complete stop and pull out the stop sign and get ready to let kids off. I’m right in the middle of the intersection and I panic cause I obviously know that you’re not supposed to pass by a bus with their lights on and stop sign out but you’re also not supposed to stop in the middle of an intersection so I pull slightly to the right and head to the start of the sidewalk/curb on my side so I’m out of the intersection and stopping for the bus. As I’m pulling over the bus driver hasn’t even opened the door or let kids off or anything and just waving his hands like there is a shark in the water freaking out for me to stop and I start getting heated and start yelling that I’m fucking stopping. Three kids finally get off and as he’s about to pull away he’s glaring at me and being all nasty and of course I’m pissed off at this point and just mouth off to him and getting angry and I was about to flip him off but held back. I’m a mom myself whose kid rides the school bus I’m not stupid, I also just left the hospital as I’m 7 months pregnant and just finished a 3 hour glucose testing which I had to fast for, plus a full bladder so I was extra agitated. I also suffer from extreme anxiety as I have an anxiety disorder so anytime something happens I dwell and get really worked up over even the smallest things, it’s really hard. After the anger subsided I was immediately overcome with emotions and just called my husband and cried on the phone to tell him what happened and just mixed with anger and sadness and stressed. Beating myself up trying to figure out what I did wrong what I should have done and then confusion. I included a picture and the red circle is where I stopped for the bus, he waited till I was in the middle of the intersection before stopping and pulling the stop sign out and I know you can’t sit in an intersection so just wondering what your opinion is and what you would have done. My husband says I did the right thing and just to fuck him and don’t dwell on it, as I stated I have anxiety on top of pregnancy hormones and this really really upset me. Also now paranoid that police will come for me cause I know buses can forward license plates to police. Just any reassurance would be great or advice or any of your own nightmare bus or driving stories I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. (This occurred in Alberta, Canada.

,Anxietyhelp,"I feel so dumb. For my whole life I’ve had the fear of throw up. In high-school it evolved form moderate to slightly severe and then subsided into my 20s. When I was 27 I had my son and it ramped up again. 

My biggest fear and worst case scenario is my son and I have the stomach bug at the same time. Luckily up until this point when we have had a bug it hits us different days but the thought of us both having it makes me shake and feel like I’m going to pass out. 

I’m not sure if this is hormone coupled with environment related but I want to work through this so bad. I see two therapists (one for EMDR) that don’t seem to take it very seriously because when I’m in therapy there is no active threat of being sick or my son being sick. 

I’ve made up some affirmations and I’d love if anyone would be able to add. This is what I have so far. 

And yes I’ve been on the emetephobia page and it makes my fear worse. 

- [ ] This will stop 
- [ ] I trust myself
- [ ] The panic I feel is temporary 
- [ ] I am safe and secure
- [ ] My anxiety can’t hurt me it is just uncomfortable 
- [ ] If I can think of the worst case scenario I can think of the best case scenario 
- [ ] I accept and acknowledge my anxiety symptoms because I know they are harmless 
- [ ] Anxiety is just trying to protect me, it is not trying to hurt me
- [ ] My mind is thinking of the worst case scenario NOT the most realistic one 
- [ ] This feeling will pass 
- [ ] I will be okay and I don’t have to plan for the worst all of the time

,Anxietyhelp,"I was dumped after a 10-year relationship. I’m f30, he’s 34. We got together young, and I focused on my education and career (law school, navigating law as a female attorney) for most of my 20s, before wanting to move in together, (that would have been the next step in our relationship).

While there was no abuse or trauma, when it came time for deeper commitment, he felt like it was too late. On my side of things, I feel like I asked him for the smallest amount of formal commitment throughout the relationship, like coming to my family and expressing his love/desire to be with me. But it never came. He felt like he was ready earlier on in the relationship because he found a stable, good paying career (vocational training) while I had to navigate my education. Other external factors include, cultural expectations (man taking the lead), (first daughter of immigrants prioritizing personal development before marriage), global pandemic, and just overall finances. Personally, I got to a point where I recognized my flaws and shortcomings in the relationship and was prepared to tackle everything head on and make things better. He felt like it was all too much too late. And he seemed to spiral into a really negative place mentally towards the end of our relationship due to unmet needs and expectations that in his words turned into resentment.

Ultimately, he monkey-branched to someone else and had a shortlived relationship. After that failed, he reached out to me after several months of no-contact. After a period of reconnection, he has left again due to deteriorating mental health and recently identified childhood traumas. I worry that my shortcomings as a partner exacerbated his trauma. Was he just unhappy all this time? Is it a midlife crisis? Is he just not that into me? Will he come back again? Was this fearful avoidant discard?

,Anxietyhelp,"
Exactly what the title of this post says. I’ve experienced this a couple of times and I’m going through it right now. I just finished a therapy session which was super helpful but I guess a little triggering as well. I don’t know what happened, I was feeling okay, but all of a sudden after it ended, I started getting random unrelated, mostly incoherent racing thoughts that felt scary (still does feel a little scary), like I don’t have control over my thoughts anymore, I’m experiencing depersonalisation, and that I’m going through psychosis. I would describe this whole thoughts/experiences or feelings to kinda being on psychedelics like LSD. 

There is a rational voice in my brain that’s telling me I’m just anxious but the fear of losing my mind is scaring me into believing that it’s not anxiety, and there’s this other part of my brain that is convincing me I’m going insane. Also, I’ve had like a total of two hours of interrupted sleep unfortunately so that might just be adding to it. I am going to be receiving ERP in therapy because I have OCD-like symptoms. I’ve also been diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder and ADHD, if that helps for some context. 

Also, I have a deep-rooted fear of experiencing psychosis because I’ve seen my uncle (diagnosed with bipolar) go through it and it’s been really scary and traumatising. 

I think me just typing this post right now is helping me put into words and perspective, what I’m experiencing, but I wanna ask if anyone here has experienced/or has heard of a similar experience so I don’t feel like I’m alone or “crazy”.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi, 27f here

In June I started experiencing sensations in my body (headaches, chest pains, shortness of breath, rapid heart beat) that kept causing huge panic attacks. A lot of these panic attacks happened either
1. when I was alone in my room, doing a hobby
2. when I woke up, also alone in my room
3. right before trying to sleep. also alone in my room lol

Because of the way my body felt, I legitimately thought I was going to die, and it seemed to get worse with each panic attack. De realization set in, I lost my ability to sleep for days at a time, kept having panic attacks while trying to sleep. Etc. I started having family members share a bed with me every night, and I haven’t slept alone since July.

To make a long story short, after 2 ER visits, many tests and wearing a heart monitor for 2 weeks, and a trip to the doctor, it turns out that I’m severely iron deficient and had way too much Vitamin D in my system. I was given hydroxyzine, which I’ve taken and had success with a handful of times, but I don’t like how it makes me feel the next day and would rather not take medication to get over this problem.

What I need advice for is this.
This whole thing has put me in a very terrible state. I’m afraid of my bedroom. I’m afraid of going to sleep alone. When I go in there and try to do any of the things I love to do, or try to sleep on my own, I feel consumed by dread and anxiety, and it makes me feel depressed in that I wish this whole debacle never happened. I don’t want to have to change my room or sleep with someone else for the rest of my life, I value my independence, and now it’s terrifying to be on my own. Ive been trying to take steps towards exposure and therefor recovery; I’ve slept alone about 4-5 times since, and I’ve been trying to spend more time in my room doing the things I usually do, but I hate the way it all feels so far. It doesnt help that I had an issue just like this way earlier in life and while I was able to overcome it, it’s excruciating for me to face the reality of it having come back.

Has anyone ever had an issue like this, and how have you overcome it? Please note that I’m really not interested in medication and therapy unfortunately isn’t that accessible in my state with the insurance that I have. How do I break these associations? Am I on the right track? Any hope? I’m having a pretty hard time recovering because of this.

For context, I seen my electrophysiologist so much he recommends I seek therapy. 


Hello everyone I wanted to make this post as a way to vent because I'm so frustrated and tired of living in fear. 

Every once in a while. It happens maybe once or twice a year, I'll get this weird episode where my heart will skip and pause and then just start fluttering/skipping really fast. It feels like a bird is flapping its wings in my chest and I feel really anxious when it happens. Sometimes it lasts 15 seconds and sometimes it lasts about 2 or 3 seconds. I've had like 3 echocardiograms, countless ekgs. Several holter monitors for 24 and 48 hours. My last echo said 

(right ventricle cavity is mildly dilated.)
I looked that up and it said it's thickening of the heart chambers

My LV ejection fraction SIM was 52.16% though it did also say
A2C EF 51%
A4C 54%


I spent ke with my electrophysiologist about these results and he said when I lose weight it will go back to normal and these results didn't concern him. 

He also said a little while back he believes I should either seek a second opinion if I don't trust him or seek therapy. I've messaged him countless times asking him questions about my heart. I did have wolff Parkinson white syndrome which felt sorta similar to this weird flutter I'd get. As a matter of fact the one time it happened, I immediately was like ""crap the wolff Parkinson white wasn't cured in the ablation.""

Someone on one of these subreddits told me last time I posted:
 
""During your ablation your physician may have also tested your ventricle with pacing and already ruled out VT from extrastim, and with a structurally normal heart, it reduces the chance even further.""
 
So I sent that exact message to my electrophysiologist and he said 
""Yes that is correct.""

He really believes it's not VT or NSVT. 


My mom did have NSVT on a holter monitors and she did say she gets fluttering in her chest but she has I think a leaky valve plus a murmur. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to trust my doctor that it's not VT but I worry that when my heart flutters, I won't have enough time to get to the hospital. I heard if VT lasts longer than 30 seconds it can be fatal. I wouldn't have any way of getting to the hospital that fast.

,Anxietyhelp,"**Didn't know where else to post this. It's a bit of a long read too, so sorry about that:** I have had anxiety around sleeping outside of my own bed since at least 13 years old, stemming from a bad experience I had at a sleepover at my cousin's house, in which we stayed up playing video games and didn't sleep except for maybe thirty minutes (needless to say, that next day was downright awful). It seems like a dumb thing to continue to fret about after that situation, especially now that I am twelve years older, but welcome to my highly neurotic world... Since then I was still able to sleep knowing I'd spend the next night outside of my own bed, but last year that all changed... I traveled three times last year, and each time I did not sleep the night before. This year it has gotten worse, in that I now have TWO bad nights before departing. In this particular case that has caused me to vent/seek advice about it, I'm not even going to be spending the night away from home. I am simply going out of town to an event related to my hobby, which makes this even more frustrating - I can't enjoy travel anymore, or at least not the first few days of it because of my broken piece of crap brain always gets this idea to behave like this when I have to travel or have something big coming up.

The thing is, there's not usually one particular thing on my mind in these situations. Sometimes I might have a song stuck in my head or something, but my brain just kinda keeps me awake... like it knows what it's doing, and simply rejecting sleep. None of the usually-recommended sleep hacks help in these situations like meditation, muscle relaxation, breathing exercises, getting up for thirty minutes then going back to bed, counting backwards, imagining yourself in a hammock or boat, white noise, etc. Even the mechanisms I found most useful in past insomnia episodes like journaling, trying to make lists in my head, drinking ""calming"" tea before bed, taking melatonin, or tiring my eyes by trying to watch a video on my phone placed far away with brightness down and volume low don't help either. I toss and turn all night because I seem to be more aware of my uncomfortable arm placement, get insanely hot, then try to remove my blanket because of this only to find it hard to sleep without it on top of me - all while time paradoxically goes by in a cruel flash. Usually by the third night I am so tired that I just KO anyway, but by then the damage has already been done. I have already had a miserable experience where I should have been enjoying myself.

I really don't know what to do anymore. As mentioned, I find this case particularly upsetting because I have an event tomorrow that I have been looking forward to for well over a year and have already spent nearly a hundred dollars on, and I just know my brain will come back for round two tonight to ensure my time there on Saturday turns out pretty miserable.

,Anxietyhelp,"
I started getting like dead tired after breakfast, woke up tired but after eating it was like my body needs to shut down, go to sleep asap type fatigue 

Which was scary af for me bc it's abnormal so it triggered high anxiety, I got a thing to check my BP and blood glucose cause I was like, I need to know this is, it lasted for like 3- 4 days bad and then subsided

This whole time my hands felt oddly cold. Sugar &amp; BP normal. I kept thinking this could all be caused by anxiety because I've  proved to myself that I can literally make myself have anxiety if I just snowball thoughts of hypochondria or anything stressful or negative

And as this tiredness subsided over the days I started to feel dizzy everytime I leaned down or leaned my head back or turned. I still do, but it's barely there now.. still got cold hands though. And I kept thinking this could all be anxiety related because I know I can literally make myself feel sick with anxiety and even get instant stomach issues if I don't control it

But yea I decided to make a doc appointment

Turns out my ferrertin is at 6. Low. Iron level &amp; everything else perfectly normal except for ferretin which is the stored iron

Between the time that I felt deathly tired and I had my blood drawn was a little over a week so I think my ferratin may have been lower before and it slowly started resolving itself

But I obv still need help because it's in deficiency right now 

I have been feeling low energy &amp; tired off &amp; on for a while and it became normal to me. And low iron isn't the only reason for all my past anxiety over the years but I know it can certainly exacerbate it.

If you have anxiety or ever feel suddenly extremely fatigued or you start feeling tired randomly, check your iron. Low iron can cause anxiety for many people. So can a bunch of other deficiencies or over abundance of nutrients or minerals so start ruling things out as soon as you're able to, it feels good to find a cause knowing you can probably figure out exactly what to do to fix it. Just that alone can give you a peace of mind. And also, of course, eat as healthy as you can, cycle ways to release stress regularly and move your body regularly. Something I slept on for a very long time especially when I've had anxiety so bad in the past that I thought there's no way this could actually help - has been deep, slow belly breathing. It really does work if you give it a little time, it's scientifically proven.
Anxiety is made a billion x worse by just our thoughts so it's like a hack to nudge the body into relaxation through the breath first so that the thoughts can follow.

Anxiety has tainted many many days of my life but over the years I found what works for me to keep it at a minimum - and I still look forward to completely eliminating it but it's a process for me because I identified with it for so long. Years ago I was bed ridden for about a week and wouldn't leave the house bc of anxiety, someone suggested that I may have anemia, got tested for it then, and I wasn't. Just giving you the extent of how bad it's been in the past... Random attacks in public and needing to retreat, it's been bad bad.

There is always something different we can try to reduce and eventually be free of it. And a health thing could even be the source which is kind of comforting since we know we can control our chemistry though food... and gaining a more positive mindset, exercise, etc. Thoughts can literally create disease because stress causes disease. Meditation &amp; eckart tolle's philosophy in ""the power of now"" have been my main helping factors but everything is connected. Eft tapping is a new thing I found recently that I've been experimenting with.
If you made it this far, don't forget you are so much stronger than you think and you absolutely can get better if you just keep trying, keep researching, you are capable and you are so loved. And if you don't have anyone then let me be the one to say I love you. I know it sounds weird but I actually feel it. I have a lot of love and I'm telepathically sending it right now and giving you a giant hug. Lol this is kinda cringe but I love you.

&lt;p&gt;Which was scary af for me bc it&amp;#39;s abnormal so it triggered high anxiety, I got a thing to check my BP and blood glucose cause I was like, I need to know this is, it lasted for like 3- 4 days bad and then subsided&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole time my hands felt oddly cold. Sugar &amp;amp; BP normal. I kept thinking this could all be caused by anxiety because I&amp;#39;ve  proved to myself that I can literally make myself have anxiety if I just snowball thoughts of hypochondria or anything stressful or negative&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as this tiredness subsided over the days I started to feel dizzy everytime I leaned down or leaned my head back or turned. I still do, but it&amp;#39;s barely there now.. still got cold hands though. And I kept thinking this could all be anxiety related because I know I can literally make myself feel sick with anxiety and even get instant stomach issues if I don&amp;#39;t control it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But yea I decided to make a doc appointment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out my ferrertin is at 6. Low. Iron level &amp;amp; everything else perfectly normal except for ferretin which is the stored iron&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the time that I felt deathly tired and I had my blood drawn was a little over a week so I think my ferratin may have been lower before and it slowly started resolving itself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I obv still need help because it&amp;#39;s in deficiency right now &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been feeling low energy &amp;amp; tired off &amp;amp; on for a while and it became normal to me. And low iron isn&amp;#39;t the only reason for all my past anxiety over the years but I know it can certainly exacerbate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have anxiety or ever feel suddenly extremely fatigued or you start feeling tired randomly, check your iron. Low iron can cause anxiety for many people. So can a bunch of other deficiencies or over abundance of nutrients or minerals so start ruling things out as soon as you&amp;#39;re able to, it feels good to find a cause knowing you can probably figure out exactly what to do to fix it. Just that alone can give you a peace of mind. And also, of course, eat as healthy as you can, cycle ways to release stress regularly and move your body regularly. Something I slept on for a very long time especially when I&amp;#39;ve had anxiety so bad in the past that I thought there&amp;#39;s no way this could actually help - has been deep, slow belly breathing. It really does work if you give it a little time, it&amp;#39;s scientifically proven.
Anxiety is made a billion x worse by just our thoughts so it&amp;#39;s like a hack to nudge the body into relaxation through the breath first so that the thoughts can follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anxiety has tainted many many days of my life but over the years I found what works for me to keep it at a minimum - and I still look forward to completely eliminating it but it&amp;#39;s a process for me because I identified with it for so long. Years ago I was bed ridden for about a week and wouldn&amp;#39;t leave the house bc of anxiety, someone suggested that I may have anemia, got tested for it then, and I wasn&amp;#39;t. Just giving you the extent of how bad it&amp;#39;s been in the past... Random attacks in public and needing to retreat, it&amp;#39;s been bad bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is always something different we can try to reduce and eventually be free of it. And a health thing could even be the source which is kind of comforting since we know we can control our chemistry though food... and gaining a more positive mindset, exercise, etc. Thoughts can literally create disease because stress causes disease.

Wanted to try Magnesium glycinate but seen it lowers blood pressure and I’m already on a med that lowers it, so don’t want to risk it. Any ideas on meds to try out? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey y’all!

Basically, a few weeks ago, I had a really nasty flare up with some stomach issues that made basically everything I ate trigger the flare up even worse. Even things on the BRAT diet would cause problems. I’ve been to a doctor about my stomach issues many times, had many different tests run, &amp; I keep coming back clear of anything more than just extreme IBS.

I suffered through that for a week straight. It’s now been about five days now and while things seem to be ok-ish, I’m having a lot of trouble with eating anything. Even foods I ate with no issue prior to the flare up make me insanely nervous that I’m gonna give myself another episode. I haven’t ate since like 4 pm today and it is now 10:30pm. I ended up feeling so nauseous &amp;/or anxious about eating anything else that I got severe cold chills and that gross, impending sense of doom that you might get before you throw up. (I didn’t, thankfully). It’s made me completely lose my appetite…

How do I make sure I’m still eating without causing myself another episode? I really don’t wanna be retracted to something like the BRAT diet for the rest of my life, but it kinda feels like it might be that way. Maybe I’m just doom spiraling?

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey everyone, I could really use some advice as I’m stuck between two major decisions right now.

I recently moved to Charlotte, NC, and honestly, I really like it here so far. I’ve already become besties with my roommate, and it feels like I finally have a solid friend to be social with, which is something I’ve wanted for a long time. One of the main reasons I moved was to be more social and grow in new ways, and Charlotte seems like the perfect place for that. Plus, at 36, I’m getting ready to put myself out there and hopefully meet someone.

However, I was just offered a fantastic job back home in Florida. It’s the exact type of job I want, and it comes with a bonus and travel reimbursement, but there’s a reason I left Florida in the first place—I wanted to distance myself and honestly, I hate the weather there. If I move back, I’ll have to live with my parents temporarily while I find a place, which will feel familiar but maybe not ideal long-term.

The job I currently have in Charlotte isn’t what I expected. It’s very difficult, the atmosphere is unsupportive, and it’s extremely demanding. I’m worried it could lead to burnout if I stay, which adds another layer to this decision.

On top of that, I can’t help but compare myself to my younger sister, who recently got married, is expecting a baby, and her husband just bought them a house. I feel like I’m so behind in life, and that’s making this decision even harder.

The job in Charlotte pays slightly more, but the Florida job offers those extra perks. The thing is, I don’t really see myself staying in Florida long-term, so I’m wondering if it’s even worth moving back just for the job.

When I first got to Charlotte, I was homesick, but that feeling has gone away, and I’m starting to feel more settled here. But with this new job offer, I’m so confused and lost about what to do next.

Any advice, wisdom, or thoughts would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much.

,Anxietyhelp,(16M) No one typically responds to me with anxiety posts but Id say I wanna give it one last shot because I really need closure because I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’ve been having a sensation of like someone is pulling me and I feel woozy if I stand up but I don’t show any physical signs of it such as me falling or off balance I don’t do any of that but it feels like I am. I also have this irrational fear of brain eating bacteria. It all started when I was showering and got water in my right nostril and immediately started panicking and told myself “I’m dead.” I immediately had pressure in my face afterwards because I have health anxiety and whatever symptom I imagine it’s there. I started making a final goodbye letter because I thought it was gonna be over but then I felt better after a little bit of calming down.

,Anxietyhelp,"Sorry if this may seem long. 
I also definitely have health anxiety. 

These last 1-2 weeks, I’ve been really worrying about the big breast C. I’ve been having some random pain in the side of my right breast, it comes and goes throughout the day. The pain doesn’t wake me and I mainly notice it when I’m sat watching telly, I don’t notice it as much when pottering around or out doing things. I also get some pain in my armpit and shoulder of the same side &amp; occasionally some pain in the left breast, again on the side. My right breast also feels a little heavier than my left and is a little bigger than my left. I know this can be normal in woman and I think I mentioned this to my partner ages ago, so I’m not entirely sure if this is new or not, I think I’m noticing it more as my health anxiety is playing up. 
I’ve also noticed that I’ve got a very slightly raised area in my chest on my right hand side.

Just for background. I had a baby 2 months ago and I also had my gallbladder removed 2 weeks ago. 

I did see a nurse at my doctors regarding this and she had a feel of my breasts and couldn’t feel anything concerning (I do have a soft lump in my right armpit which has been checked twice at two different hospitals and been told it’s axillary breast tissue). The nurse also thinks that the slightly raised area in my chest is possibly residue gas from my operation (as they put gas inside you to see more clearly). I think the raised area in my chest may have reduced slightly but I’m not 100% sure. 

I contacted my doctors again today because I was concerned about the one breast also feeling a little heavier than the other and they just said that if things haven’t settled down in another week then to go back to them as they think this is all linked to having a baby and having surgery.

I'll try to keep 15 years of pain short.

I first remember having sharp, burning pains in my lower back after prolonged sitting when I was in middle school (I'm 27). I'd jump up, do a few stretches, keep moving so it doesn't feel painful. Eventually manage to cut out the pains by finding the right, odd position 
Aaaand I basically did that for the following years. Untile it became ALL THE TIME. 

After the back pain followed headaches, stomach cramps, neck pains; then shoulder, knees, jaw, feet, hands. I broke my wrist a couple years ago in a car crash, but my neck wss fine on x-rays. Like every test I ever did (not done yet). But if you remember above, I DID NOT want to feel pain (duh, i know). So you know, i just instintctually tighten the painful muscles until it overrides the pain. And I keep doing that, over and over and over until some of them are so tight all the time that I don't even feel them anymore. 

If I even *try* to relax my entire body, I feel sharp and burning pains all over, as well as a feeling of breathlessness and I cannot keep myself up.

But here's the kicker. If I breath deeply and manage to relax, I start cramping and twitching one piece at a time. Eventually I do feel a bit better, though shorty, if I manage to fight the urge to move for long enough.

Now: could I actually hate myself so much that I shut out  potentially disabling, if not paralizing pain just so, you know, I'm not an inconvenience? I mean, that does sound like me, but it does feel unrealistic to be able to handle all that pain for so long without anyone suspecting. Soooo yeah that's it.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi all. 

OCD &amp; anxiety (GAD) Sufferer here. 

Two months ago I stopped taking my SSRI cold turkey (I know...) thinking I was “cured” as i was doing pretty well. Well, as a result, for the past month I've been really struggling mental-health wise. My anxiety, in particular, has been through the roof. 

Last week I started using benzos to manage, which has helped somewhat, but I know I can't be on them long term. 

My psychiatrist wants me back on my SSRI (Luvox) but I'm just tired &amp; tbh... scared, of going through the entire process again. OTOH, I realise getting back on them might be the best bet for me. 

I've also been considering taking Kratom to help me manage my anxiety/OCD and lift my mood but idk how wise going down that route would be. I've used it before, so I know it helps but it comes with a lot of side effects, plus potential for addiction. Has anyone here used it, long-term, successfully? 

I guess I'm just ranting here, but I would really appreciate any sort of advice, especially if you've been in a similar situation after stopping your meds. 

Thanks.

,Anxietyhelp,"My anxiety got pretty bad again lately so im trying to cope with it by calming myself with some positive affirmations.
It helps me to think of my anxiety as my younger self that never overcame the bad experinces she's made and therefore tries everything to protect present me. I imagine myself telling these things to her aswell and making it clear that im trying to help her, because we both deserve to feel safe.

- I will provide my body and mind with the patience that is needed to overcome this, because I deserve it.

- I deserve to feel good. I deserve to make experiences that arent overshadowed by anxiety and guilt.

- I am loved and im enough.

- I am stronger than my anxiety. I wont go down without a fight. And I will win that fight.

- It is scientifically proven that anxiety can manifest itself as physical discomfort. This is not real and I will be okay.

- I can overcome this because I did it before. I am safe.

Has anyone had it where they start obsessing over random past memories and twisting them around so much in your head that it makes you sick? 

I’ve been bed bound for the last 2 weeks with anxiety so bad it makes me feel like my world is ending like proper world ending anxiety. My stomach feels like it’s had a hit knife stuck in it and I can barely eat. 

I recently started a course of SSRIs and beta blockers but so far neither seems to be touching it. I’m crawling the walls here.

,Anxietyhelp,"(TRIGGER WARNING: C word and unalive word mentioned) First off I’m a long time sufferer of anxiety. I know pretty much all the ins and outs of this terrible disease that unfortunately plagues so many of us. What I don’t know is how to make it stop or just lessen it. My worry for the past 2 years or so is fixated around my gi tract. I’ve been to the doctors/hospital a few times for the same reason. I’ve had tons of blood tests done, physical exams, etc. and everything is fine. I know for a fact that all of these symptoms are caused by my anxiety, (too many to list but revolving around stomach) but at the same time my anxiety tries to convince me otherwise. I am absolutely utterly obsessed with my bowel movements, I have gone through phases where I will look at it so closely that I begin to see things that aren’t even there. I think everything is blood and that my days are numbered. I have never had blood in my stool aside from a hemorrhoid that I’ve had for over 8 years that flares up every once in a while and I get a slight amount of fresh blood on the tp. That usually sets me off too even though I know what it is, I’ve taken picture of said hem so I know that’s what it’s from and I use cream for it and it has improved it significantly. What my problem is that I think every little thing in my stool is blood, I can’t stop thinking this way, I obsess over it. I don’t even look at it anymore but yet here I am still worried about it. I don’t allow myself to look at anymore. I just don’t know how to stop this way of thinking, something has to give. I’ve done everything you’re supposed to do. I’ve talked to therapists, I’m on meds, I’ve went and got exams and things to make sure I’m healthy but yet I still think I’m not. I just don’t know what to do, I feel trapped in this way of thinking.

i used to go camping every year with my family for like a week but the last time we did (2019, 2020, something like that) i had such a horrible experience and i just felt sick the entire week. it kind of put me off any sort of holiday trip and now just overnight trips in general. it doesn’t help that im also quite a bad emetophobe now too. i’m also anxious about the sleeping space. i’ve managed to get a room that is just exclusively me and my friends but i haven’t had to share a room with anyone in ages and i think it’s also making me nervous. i like my own space because if i do freak out nobody is gonna judge if i have to turn on a fan, or start pacing about or anything really.
i really want to go on the residential because ive been excited to go since year 9 and i genuinely want to enjoy it. i’m just worried about the whole overnight thing? i mean im trying to rationalise it in my head, ive done a sleepover since and i was perfectly fine, i was perfectly fine for literally every other camping trip apart from that one, etc etc. i also stay at another family member’s house every weekend (so for 1 night a week i sleep elsewhere) and im also using that to rationalise it but im worried it’ll be different because ive been sleeping at that family member’s house since i was very little.

I have an upcoming medical appointment next week, rheumatologist. Since I've been 12 years old, I've dealt with constant joint pain/weakness and crepitances. We had shit healthcare so my mom wasn't able to ever address it. Now as an adult (mid 20's), I finally managed to get an appointment. I've waited 8 months for this, and I honestly didn't think much of it. However, now that the appointment is around the corner I'm SO nervous. I think I'm scared ill ""fail"" at the appointment or something as if it was a job interview hahah.

TLDR: Nervous about going to a specialist appointment because my brain loves to assume I'll say the wrong things and ""fail"" the interaction.

A little nugget from me though, if someone gives you an appointment for a freakishly long time away, take it. Even if it's discouraging, the time will pass anyway.

I think I&amp;#39;m scared ill &amp;quot;fail&amp;quot; at the appointment or something as if it was a job interview hahah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Nervous about going to a specialist appointment because my brain loves to assume I&amp;#39;ll say the wrong things and &amp;quot;fail&amp;quot; the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little nugget from me though, if someone gives you an appointment for a freakishly long time away, take it. Even if it&amp;#39;s discouraging, the time will pass anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi all,

Recently, I've been working really hard on managing my anxiety and panicky feelings whenever they're about to come. I get the anxious bouts in public places that are usually crowded where I feel like I'm walking on a trampoline but other than that, I've been doing good. 

However, I was out to dinner finishing up my food the other night and started feeling a panic attack coming so I immediately got up and went to the bathroom where I started doing box breathing and EFT tapping. Luckily we were already getting ready to leave so that also helped.

Then this morning, I woke up to go to the bathroom and just had this feeling of dread/scared/doom/panic... and the feeling as if I was going to cry. I went back to bed, slept for a few hours and now I'm doing okay. I've had these feelings before when I was out and about that would only be for like 5 seconds but I haven't experienced it in a while.

I was doing some research and it indicates high cortisol levels (high stress response) first thing in the morning.

Has anyone else experienced this before and if so, what do you do to help it?

Then, about a month later, I was going to a friend’s house for a party and nearly threw up before going in. I figured it was anxiety, but had never felt anything like it before. Then about 2 weeks ago, I once again felt nauseous - seemingly for no reason. But the feeling has stuck since. I went out to dinner with family a few days ago and felt sick the entire time. 

Additionally, I had been interviewing for various jobs and got a few offers. No anxiety through the whole process. I turned the offers down solely because they weren’t really what I was looking for. Now I have an interview for a career that I think I would love and can’t even fathom going into that office this week. Once again, I feel sick.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi everyone,

I’ve struggled with anxiety and panic attacks for most of my life, but this year, I’ve been putting in a lot of effort to break the cycle—and I’m finally starting to feel like I’m making progress! Last month, I was able to travel and stay away from home twice without experiencing a panic attack, which is a huge win for me.

Some of the things that have been really helpful for me include lifting weights at the gym and reading two great books: *Hope and Help for Your Nerves* and *Dare*.

I’m curious—what’s been the most effective for you in reducing your anxiety or managing panic attacks? Whether it's an activity, a book, or even a mindset shift, I’d love to hear what has worked for you.

,Anxietyhelp,"I don’t know what’s specifically triggering it. Recently I’ve gotten a hyperfix on an old show I used to watch, and part of me is really enjoying it, but another part is feeling intense dread that I can’t control.
It’s upsetting cause I’ve been stuck on the same interest for almost five years and want a change + I’m genuinely getting attached to the characters.
At first I was uncomfortable cause my original rewatch was during a really bad time in my life + I hadn’t switched my interest in 5 years.
Then I started worrying abt all these little details, like if I could make friends with other fans, or if it would be thematically fulfilling like my last interest (might be confusing- I write au’s + fanfics of the stuff I like so in a way I borrow the media). 

Now I’m just anxious that I’m gonna get anxious if I watch the show or think abt it.
I’m not entirely sure if I’m still feeling dread because it reminds me of the past, or if I’m not ready for a change..? I want it to go away so I can pursue this fixation but it refuses to. It’s been 2 weeks now.

-hyperventilating
-unable to make decisions
-shame and guilt
-self-deprecating comments and feelings
-uncontrollable crying

,Anxietyhelp,"There was no way around it, no sugar coating it, a full fledged panic attack was underway. All my reassuring motivating mantras and positive rational thinking were out the window. I couldn’t be sure I wasn’t in danger. This one really put me over the top. I’d ask myself, what do I really think the outcome will be? The outcome will be that I will be fine. Never mind what I think MIGHT happen some day. Is there any reason this time will be different than the last 200 times? I can put up with this for now and let it settle itself down later. I don’t need for it to go away right now. As soon as I am thinking about something else this will be gone. NO HURRY. Yes, it would come back, but as long as I wasn’t dwelling on it all the time, it gradually wore out. It would nag at me, want my attention, but I would dismiss it over and over again without much thought til it faded away. If I couldn’t see it as being no big deal when I felt anxious, I certainly could see it that way the rest of the time. It wasn’t about what I did as much as it was about what I didn't do. I learned to not get hung up on the fact that “yeah, I know. I tried all this, but it’s not going away, and why does this happen, what do I do, I’m so frustrated.

I’d ask myself, what do I really think the outcome will be? The outcome will be that I will be fine. Never mind what I think MIGHT happen some day. Is there any reason this time will be different than the last 200 times? I can put up with this for now and let it settle itself down later. I don’t need for it to go away right now. As soon as I am thinking about something else this will be gone. NO HURRY. Yes, it would come back, but as long as I wasn’t dwelling on it all the time, it gradually wore out. It would nag at me, want my attention, but I would dismiss it over and over again without much thought til it faded away. If I couldn’t see it as being no big deal when I felt anxious, I certainly could see it that way the rest of the time. It wasn’t about what I did as much as it was about what I didn&amp;#39;t do. I learned to not get hung up on the fact that “yeah, I know. I tried all this, but it’s not going away, and why does this happen, what do I do, I’m so frustrated. I’ know I should leave it alone, but how do I leave it alone” You wait it out. That sort of anxious, negative thinking was just reinforcing it in my brain.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hey guys. I’ve been having severe panic attacks this past month, with ER visits included, and I just wanted to write out an update about my own situation.

When I visited the ER the social worker there got me an appointment with a mental health facility. I had my appointment there today to get assessed by one of their therapists and was referred to an outpatient treatment program for 4 hours a day, 5 days a week. The treatment includes counseling and a psych to hopefully get me on some meds that will actually work.

My panic attacks have gone down in frequency, now only ocurring in the night for the past few days. It is still difficult to get myself to sleep due to my fear of dying in my sleep, but it is a definite improvement over fearing dying 24/7. I am hopeful with my doctor appointment tomorrow I may be able to get on the medication they gave me in the ER that calmed me down.

I’m still struggling with major health anxiety, but I am trying my hardest not to think about everything that could be wrong with my body because I know that does more harm than good.

,Anxietyhelp,"Hi all - 

I’m 18 years old and supposed to go to the eras tour in November. I went last summer as well, but got tickets to this show at the end of last summer. In April, I had a major anxiety breakdown and couldn’t eat/be in a car/leave the house without having a panic attack for about a month or so. In May, I spent all of it trying not to have more panic attacks. I have emetophobia, and I felt nauseous from anxiety so I was constantly at the peak of my anxiety. I tried to drive to the beach with my friends in May, and had a panic attack in the passenger seat. I am now remedicated on Zoloft and it seems to mostly help. I can now drive for I know at least 45 minutes without having a panic attack. The concert is 2.5 hours away and I’m supposed to go with 2 of my friends but they’re both in college so my girlfriends family would drive me down and already rented out 2 hotel rooms (cancellable)

My anxiety hasn’t been tested in a while since I haven’t had a chance to go anywhere far away. I haven’t had a car panic attack in months, but I’m worried about the sound in the concert and having a panic attack in front of my friends. I don’t want to be almost 3 hours from home and freaking out about the car ride. I’m not sure if I can do it and I’d rather disappoint them than have a panic attack and ruin their night. I’d probably sell the ticket to one of my friends who is also their friends if I did sell it. 

I need advice. The pros to cancelling are a weight lifted off of my shoulders and not having to be scared anymore. The cons are I will miss the concert, maybe disappoint my friends, etc. The only thing I have fomo about is surprise songs and/or if she announces anything (Indy N3).

&lt;p&gt;I’m 18 years old and supposed to go to the eras tour in November. I went last summer as well, but got tickets to this show at the end of last summer. In April, I had a major anxiety breakdown and couldn’t eat/be in a car/leave the house without having a panic attack for about a month or so. In May, I spent all of it trying not to have more panic attacks. I have emetophobia, and I felt nauseous from anxiety so I was constantly at the peak of my anxiety. I tried to drive to the beach with my friends in May, and had a panic attack in the passenger seat. I am now remedicated on Zoloft and it seems to mostly help. I can now drive for I know at least 45 minutes without having a panic attack. The concert is 2.5 hours away and I’m supposed to go with 2 of my friends but they’re both in college so my girlfriends family would drive me down and already rented out 2 hotel rooms (cancellable)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My anxiety hasn’t been tested in a while since I haven’t had a chance to go anywhere far away. I haven’t had a car panic attack in months, but I’m worried about the sound in the concert and having a panic attack in front of my friends. I don’t want to be almost 3 hours from home and freaking out about the car ride. I’m not sure if I can do it and I’d rather disappoint them than have a panic attack and ruin their night. I’d probably sell the ticket to one of my friends who is also their friends if I did sell it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need advice. The pros to cancelling are a weight lifted off of my shoulders and not having to be scared anymore. The cons are I will miss the concert, maybe disappoint my friends, etc. The only thing I have fomo about is surprise songs and/or if she announces anything (Indy N3). I’d be devastated if something happened and I was supposed to be there, but I’m not sure how to guarantee I won’t freak out while there. I trust once I’m in the venue it would probably be fine but getting there and getting out is really scaring me. It was the best day of my life last time, but I was with my girlfriend and I wasn’t having this anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help me&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"To start off, this isn't just anxiety - there Autism, OCD, IBS, a major phobia of vomiting, trauma and ARFID thrown into the mix. Fun stuff!! (Sarcasm). 

The long and short of my backstory is that I spend the best part of 3 years at home 24/7, with parents who I was reliant on to help me manage panic attacks and anxiety. I was doing a lot better last year when I first started at Uni, but over the last 10 months I've had several traumatic events that have deeply upset me and made me want that comfort of home more regularly. I have been home for the summer since May and I'm now due to start back at uni next week. I'm in therapy and on medication but I don't think they do much. 

I'm currently staying in my student accommodation with my best friend, but I'm finding it so hard to cope with everything. I've tried twice to be in this new accomodation for a half-week but only been able to manage two days each time - which both ended in me having massive panic attacks before being picked up to come home, or catching the train back. Today is the second day of my third attempt - I've already had multiple panic attacks and an IBS flare worse than I've had in ages. 

The comfort of being home (and hy extension, my parents) is so deeply important to me, and being away from it is terrifying. I'm not comfortable here - if I had a panic attack right now, I'd only be able to call my mum and have her talk to me down the phone, compared to at home where she'd be able to help me just by being by my side. Theses so much pressure here too - if I have a bad panic attack at home, I have my parents to take care of me and help me through it. Here, I only have my best friend, who I'm not comfortable being 100% vulnerable with, unlike my parents. 

I'm 20 years old and I shouldn't be feeling like this. Everyone I know loves being away from their parents, and look forward to the freedom of uni. But I'm just sitting here worrying that I won't be able to reach them when something horrible happens to me. I just want their help but they're so far away. I'm meant to feel free but I feel trapped. And I don't know what to do. 

I desperately want to be normal and have a normal university experience - having fun in class, joining societies, meeting new people, getting into a relationship, playing videogames with my extended friend group, dressing up and going out, buying gifts for my friends, forming new connections... But I don't get to have that.

Classes start back next week - I need to be better for them. But I can barely stay a day at this new accomodation without feeling viscerally unwell from the anxiety and panic attacks. I can barely take care of myself - getting out of bed and dressed, making meals, cleaning up after myself... All these come naturally to me at home (I want to make it clear that I *do not* rely on my parents to take care of me in terms of housework or taking care of myself physically) but feel 1000x harder when I'm in a bad mental state. It's so much pressure, all the time, with no escape!!

,Anxietyhelp,"So I’ve been on this anxiety/panic ride on and off for 25 years BUT I still get a little concerned about some of the symptoms it can cause. Shocker! 

The best way to describe this concerning symptom I’m having is feeling like my vision gets blurry but I can see clearly (if that make sense). It’s almost like I can see everything around me but I can’t focus on one item- it’s like complete vision overwhelm and when it happens, it triggers panic.

Example- today I was picking my kid up from school. I always get a bit anxious doing that as it’s chaotic. There is no pick up line, parents are cutting other parents off, it’s jam packed on a small one way road and is just an overall overwhelming 10 minutes. When I can get in and out, I’m ok. But today, that was not the case. It’s was so backed up I felt trapped. Cue in the anxiety- “I need to get out! Please, let’s go. What if something happened to me, I’m trapped on this one way road and nobody is going to give a crap, everyone is just concerned about getting home.” Then all the sudden comes the weird unfocused visions that makes me feel like I might be lightheaded but I’m not. It just feels like visual chaos.

,Anxietyhelp,"I need someone to tell me if I’m overreacting?? Or I’m having some severe anxiety in general right now and don’t know what to do. Like I feel like I’m losing my mind.

I just got home from a new patient wellness appointment with my first ever adult PCP. I’m 25, autistic, and haven’t been to a doctor in general in ages unfortunately due to lack of insurance, time, etc.
I have severe anxiety in general, but it will get 10x worse in medical environments due to bad experiences in the past.
I went by myself because I don’t have family in this area and I had no friends available that could come with me.

Are PCP visits supposed to be so damn short and rushed??
I genuinely went in thinking I could have the time to go over what I wanted or be able to feel out this primary to see if I wanted to come back, but everything was so speedran??
I listed on my profile that I struggle with severe unmedicated anxiety, verbally told the doctor that I have a hard time in medical settings. I didn’t expect to be in there for an hour or more or anything, but the entire visit had to been less than 15 minutes. All she did was listen to my heart, wiggle my knees because I blanked and mentioned joint pain when she asked about concerns and I could only think of most recent. Like everything was so fast, I couldn’t have a chance to even gather myself and sort my thoughts so I could communicate anything properly. I went straight into a survival/flight autopilot the entire visit. The usual “Yes” “No” “Sometimes” responses.

I was on the verge of having an attack the entire visit and couldn’t think straight enough to go over even half of what has been bothering me to we could plan next steps. I kept choking up and was clearly on the verge of tears the entire time. I even went in with a list like I’ve seen people recommending to help with anxiety and I just completely forgot about it. I wanted to ask about medication possibly, or a psychiatrist to go to, but didn’t get the chance because I was so out of it.

They let me sit in the room for a minute to finish filling out my paperwork afterwards and I broke down. I realized I didn’t understand half the questions on the paperwork and it just tipped me over the edge.
They came back after like three minutes and told me again that I was good to go and then just left the room door wide open while I was in the middle of an anxiety attack. The hall and lobby were full of people and I was hardly able to pull it together to leave. I left the building so fast after I gave the desk the paperwork, and I don’t even know if I filled all of it out correctly. I was going to try googling things as I was filling it out, but I was panicking and didn’t have enough time.

I feel absolutely ridiculous, frustrated, and embarrassed right now, and like I don’t even want to go back anymore. It felt no different than if I just went to an urgent care or something. I have no idea if this was a normal experience, a bad experience, or if I’m overreacting? Or I don’t even know at this point.

,Anxietyhelp,"my boyfriend just left for school across the county for college and since he's left i have had a burning chest, nausea, high blood pressure and shakiness. coincidentally, i just had my birthday on wednesday and have been drinking almost every day since then and im assuming a lot of it may be hangxiety?? but i just don't know how to fix it.

for reference, i know my boyfriend will never cheat on me. i don't think that he would go out to a party and make out or sleep with someone or anything of that sort. I'm scared that he will realize he is happier without me and that he might fall for someone else.

he has female friends here at home, and now he has some at school. but i don't know why it feels different. he made a mistake recently and had a girl in his dorm late at night to watch a movie with him and his roommate (who have been friends for years, they moved up there together) and didn't think to tell me until i asked. he apologized profusely but it has made my anxiety even worse.

and before he left he broke up with me because he thought the long distance would be too hard but then asked me back 4 hours later because he realized he wanted to be with me forever and that he couldn't imagine life without me.

we both acknowledged that this would be hard but worth it. he is the love of my life and i have to just trust that he feels that way too. he's always made it very apparent. we've wanted to get married since the day he asked me to be his.

his classes are just now starting today so he's just been going wherever with all these friends that he's made since he got there. and he updates me when he can, i just can't shake this sinking feeling. we've gone from texting everyday and calling every single night and seeing each other once a week to calling for an hour or less every once in awhile and texting much less frequently. i don't want to be overbearing and stress him out and inadvertently push him away, i just don't know what to do with myself. i know that once he has all of his syllabuses and knows what his day to day schedule will be like we will be able to plan our once a week date nights and have set aside times for us to call and chat. but i'm just so stressed right now.

,Anxietyhelp,"I feel like I'm constantly trying to reach out to people who just don't care to reach back, and like my entire life revolves around my husband and son; like I don't really have anything for just myself. And all of that causes me anxiety and makes me sad (not that i don't love my husband and son and want to be there for them, but we all have our limits). How do those of you who have similar feelings/concerns deal with them? 

When I was growing up, my entire life revolved around my parents - especially my mother - and trying to please them as best I could, which meant not having a voice of my own and constantly being physically and verbally abused whenever I tried to assert myself or didn't quite do things the way my mom wished. I'm in therapy and it has helped immensely, but I haven't been in a few weeks. I know I need to get back to it and I will soon. But in the meantime, I'm here to vent a bit... Heh. 💕

I know I need people - more than my husband, son, a couple of close friends and my therapist, but whenever I try to branch out in person, my social anxiety pulls me back and makes me feel less than which in turn makes me spend money on needless items that I'm constantly trying to declutter my home of and then I end up recluttering again and again (one of those vicious cycles) or I eat junk food to try to cope (this hasn't been as bad of late, for the most part).

Anyways, any advice or virtual support would be greatly appreciated. I feel so down of late, more than usual, and I can't seem to get out of this funk.

,Anxietyhelp,"Im currently 22, Female and I've had the worst health anxiety ever since I was a little kid. Any little thing that I thought was wrong with me would somehow make me panic. Fortunately back then I was under Medicaid so any sort of issue I had I could easily go to the hospital and get checked without any problems or issue. Well last year I lost my Medicaid and haven't had any health insurance until this past June thanks to my new full time job. And because of it I went months without getting checked out due to not being able to afford it even if I had issues.

 Well in the end of august I started getting this ice pick head pain any time I would bend over, strain in some sort of way or turn my head in certain directions. I still have this issue going on and it's making me feel crazy and anxious. I'm also dealing with headaches, nausea, and dizziness. Another thing is I have a swollen lymph node under my jaw that hasn't grown but has stayed hard and the same since like the beginning of September. Another thing is I started noticing I've been having symptoms of oscillopsia for a couple months now and can't tell if I've had this for years now. Either way I'm going through so many health issues that my health anxiety is worse than usual. And it all just makes me think straight to cancer and I'm so terrified. I've had one friend die from brain cancer and another die from leukemia. And overall it has become my worst fear since middle school. 
Either way I've just become so stressed and anxious about my health that I can't even enjoy anything anymore without those things coming into mind. I do have a doctors appointment this upcoming Friday as well as a vision doctors appointment in November but I'm tired of waiting. 

Also some added info: I got into a car accident 1 year and a half ago where a guy hit me from the side. It was a minor accident but I'm not sure if that could have been the reason for my symptoms now. I've also gotten covid in the past. 

Edit: I'm also anxious because the doctors I've had check me in the past for any issues would never fully check me and would just assume it was something rather than actually examine my body. Which has left me sometimes so frustrated and angry at them because they're the professionals. Yet they cant find what's wrong with me.

Especially now that I have to actually pay out of pocket for these check ups.&lt;/p&gt;

The only way I can describe it is like anxiety but only the physical side of it. I have no mental issues and nothing serious to worry about. I have never had issues with anxiety or caffeine before.

I’m here in seek of guidance on how I can help my girlfriend.

We have been together for almost a year and she has always struggled with anxiety. Specifically she experiences the worst of it late at night when we are trying to go to bed.

,Anxietyhelp,"What I’m dealing with is potential agoraphobia, BUT the anxiety symptoms are not linked to just leaving the property. (Live on a farm. So it isn’t just leaving the house.)

I have only left the house once in roughly 7 months. It’s a family farm. I can go outside and do all kinds of chores/manual labor without a single issue. I also work remotely via computer. So I rarely have to go in to an actual office. When I do, it’s 2 hours one way. The anxiety has gotten so bad that if a car ride exceeds 5 minutes, maybe slightly less, the symptoms and panic start to set in.

I’m not claustrophobic, and I have not been in a severe accident. The worst was being rear ended by a motorcycle while riding passenger. (Everyone was fine, other than the damage to the rear bumper and the bike.)

My symptoms actually seem to make me panic more. The biggest one is that my anxiety seems to have a direct link to my stomach. (It is true that your anxiety has a direct line to your stomach &amp; nerves.) Making me have to use the restroom, and urgently at that. When the nearest big towns are 30 - 45 minutes away, this is not great. Nearest small town is about 15 - 20 minutes away.

Other symptoms:
- Feeling shaky
- Feeling my pulse all over my body/heart beating super hard, but not necessarily rapidly.
- Feeling really hot
- Mouth goes dry
- Muscles contract and shake involuntarily. I can try to stop it by relaxing them, but that lasts only a few seconds before they seize again.
- Nausea, but it’s not every single time. That’s a hit or miss symptoms.
- Unable to talk or it’s extremely hard physically to force words out.
- Disassociate/become so wrapped up in my thoughts that it amplifies and it’s hard to put focus anywhere else.

I do not want to go on medication. It’s no shade to people that use it, but I personally am not going to rely on a medication if it isn’t necessary. (Life or death situation.)

I am wondering if others have these symptoms as well, and if there’s any methods that seem to really help control or even totally relieve some, if not all symptoms.

The only reason I don’t believe it’s agoraphobia solely is because I can still have these moments at home, but they’re less common.

I try to fast before going anywhere, but then I can wind up with severe headaches and feel ill from not eating. I don’t drive, so I’m always with someone and don’t want to inhibit their plans because I’m stuck in the bathroom somewhere and they have to work around me. I miss when I could jump in a vehicle and go without ever considering where the nearest bathroom is, or calculating exact times of leaving, travel, and arriving somewhere.

Even as these episodes happen I’m logically thinking “There’s no reason for this.” but we know anxiety isn’t always logical. It’s infuriating to a degree, and it’s even worse when you already don’t care to go do stuff because you’re a homebody by nature and there aren’t many pros that outweigh the cons of having to leave and go places. I’d be happy if I could manage it enough to comfortably go do things that are necessary to do without them being stressful. Car rides leave me feeling like I ran a marathon and I’m utterly exhausted. That feeling of when your social battery is 100% drained and you have no more energy to put into anything else? That’s me after a ride. Even if it was 20 - 30 minutes round trip.

I have no clue what to do. So I’m looking for advice. Especially if it’s a method someone has tried and found some success with. 

Thanks.",t2_17ku0os46j,False,,0,False,Anxiety (Agoraphobia),[],r/Anxietyhelp,False,,,0,,,False,t3_1ft3oia,False,light,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Need Advice,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1727723115.0,text,,,,text,self.Anxietyhelp,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I’m dealing with is potential agoraphobia, BUT the anxiety symptoms are not linked to just leaving the property. (Live on a farm. So it isn’t just leaving the house.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only left the house once in roughly 7 months. It’s a family farm. I can go outside and do all kinds of chores/manual labor without a single issue. I also work remotely via computer. So I rarely have to go in to an actual office. When I do, it’s 2 hours one way. The anxiety has gotten so bad that if a car ride exceeds 5 minutes, maybe slightly less, the symptoms and panic start to set in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not claustrophobic, and I have not been in a severe accident. The worst was being rear ended by a motorcycle while riding passenger. (Everyone was fine, other than the damage to the rear bumper and the bike.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My symptoms actually seem to make me panic more. The biggest one is that my anxiety seems to have a direct link to my stomach. (It is true that your anxiety has a direct line to your stomach &amp;amp; nerves.) Making me have to use the restroom, and urgently at that. When the nearest big towns are 30 - 45 minutes away, this is not great. Nearest small town is about 15 - 20 minutes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms:
- Feeling shaky
- Feeling my pulse all over my body/heart beating super hard, but not necessarily rapidly.
- Feeling really hot
- Mouth goes dry
- Muscles contract and shake involuntarily. I can try to stop it by relaxing them, but that lasts only a few seconds before they seize again.
- Nausea, but it’s not every single time. That’s a hit or miss symptoms.
- Unable to talk or it’s extremely hard physically to force words out.
- Disassociate/become so wrapped up in my thoughts that it amplifies and it’s hard to put focus anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not want to go on medication. It’s no shade to people that use it, but I personally am not going to rely on a medication if it isn’t necessary. (Life or death situation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering if others have these symptoms as well, and if there’s any methods that seem to really help control or even totally relieve some, if not all symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason I don’t believe it’s agoraphobia solely is because I can still have these moments at home, but they’re less common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to fast before going anywhere, but then I can wind up with severe headaches and feel ill from not eating.

,Anxietyhelp,"I'm struggling right now. I'm trying to make things better, I'm trying to get myself well and be the dad my kids deserve and actually live my life instead of just existing in others. But I'm so tired. My mental health is shit and has been all year. I've been dealing with possible menieres disease which is making my health anxiety so much worse. 

I'm so worried about my ex wife. I can see she's struggling more again but I can't do much to help and I'm worried I'm making things worse for her. I can't cope without her. I can't tell my kids their mums never coming home but I've had that conversation in my head a thousand times and everytime it destroys me more. These thoughts just won't stop and I'm so fucking tired. 

Thoughts about my family dying, about me getting sick, about someone getting into a car accident, the tree falling over and crashing into my daughters bedroom, about being attacked by dogs walking to schools, about my son mixing with shitty kids at school and getting into something bad. My mum dying. Being evicted. It never stops. 

I'm scared about everything. I'm scared to do anything in case I screw it up. I'm scared to go anywhere in case I'm ill. I'm scared to be happy because I feel like if I am then something really, truly awful will happen. 

I can't see anything good in my future. Only everything I fear coming true. My ex dying, then me dying leaving my kids without either of us, if they haven't died first. 

I feel sick. I just want her well and for things to be normal and boring and to not feel this overwhelming dread that won't stop. I hate being this weak and afraid and useless.

I mentioned that to my doctor and she brushed it off. Now here I am on a Sunday afternoon with really bad chest pain on my left side but also sort of in the middle and I’m debating going to the ER. How am I supposed to know if it’s serious or just anxiety? It physically hurts and it’s hard to catch my breath. Of course google is making it 10 times worse. Here wait times are hours so I also don’t want to waste my time going just for it to be dismissed as nothing. My other option was wait till Tuesday (long weekend) to get a referral for an xray or something but again, I don’t know if this is something serious or just my anxiety acting up. Please help!&lt;/p&gt;

2. About diabetes after Covid

5. About my GI issues
6. About the CFS / long covid in general

I’m 20 yr old female.

I’m also a student, I need to study, get back to uni. 


I’ll do blood tests in 2 weeks after covid(letting it stabilize). But I’m a wreck. I lost weight, because my body seems not to absorb nutrients. I’m having constant tachycardia which is very very high. I am also having some mucus cough left. And it’s my 3rd week. 
I did medical tests already, for my heart esp, because I can’t live like that. It seems to be fine on mri, holter ahead of me yet. 
I hate it, I hate that it generated so much anxiety for me. Maybe it’s even biological, I don’t know. But it doesn’t matter at this point… I’ve always been a bit anxious but I’ve managed it for a while now. And Covid has taken away my ability to calm down and also excerise which were a huge part of my well being.
I hate it. I hate that I got it and I hate what it did to me. I know I need time.

,Anxietyhelp,"We’re discussing a lot! Anxious and Avoidant Attachments, Clingy, Fear of Abandonment, Self-Sabotage, Seeking Attention, Ghosted, Hot and Cold, Heartbreak, People Pleasing, Soulmates, Feeling Stuck, Trust and Commitment Issues, Unconditional Love, Detach vs Live in the End, Feeling Confident and Worthy, Closure, Letting Go and Moving On.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR: **You feel lonely, rejected, and attract emotionally unavailable relationships because you judge yourself** (and others). It’s a **reflection you’re emotionally unavailable with yourself.** When you feel ghosted by others, that’s a reflection you're ghosting yourself. As odd as it sounds, **emotionally unavailable men feel safe. Fear of abandonment is actually faith in abandonment;** expecting people will leave, than stay. And to find your soulmate, look in a mirror.

* **Ulterior motives cause relationship issues** (and that’s not a judgement; just clarity for awareness). I.e. *“I believe my emotions come from outside of me. So I want to change my circumstances and other people, so then I can feel better.”*

**You feeling loved in the relationship is your job;** not theirs. The other person can’t make you feel loved, because they can’t control your thoughts. You're afraid of feeling fear. But **fear is loving guidance** that just wants to help you love yourself more. You’re sad because you have a new relationship with yourself and others that’s ready to begin, and you’re not allowing it. As you **focus on flowing more love to yourself and the world, then you allow the world to find many ways of reflecting back your self-love to you.**

**Negative emotions are positive guidance** (although it might not feel that way) letting you know you’re focusing on (and judging) what you don't want. **Negative emotions are just messengers** of limiting beliefs you're practicing. They're a necessary part of your emotional guidance; like GPS in your car. But the more you avoid or fight them, you keep yourself stuck. **All emotions are equal and worthy.** But people unknowingly create a hierarchy for their emotions (i.e. positive = good; negative = bad). As you start seeing **negative emotions as worthy and supportive friends,** then you work together as a team to help you emotionally connect with yourself.

**Your emotions come from your thoughts;** they don't come from your circumstances or other people.

* When you **focus on what you want** = You **feel better.**
* When you **focus on (and invalidate or judge) what you don't want** = You **feel worse.**

That’s empowering to know because then you have the freedom and ability to feel better, if you want to. And hypothetically, **if you never judged anything** (which isn’t realistic, but this is just an example), **you would never feel negative emotion.** Isn’t that interesting?

.

# The Cycles of Feeling Stuck in Relationships

Here's why you’re stuck attracting primates instead of prime mates:

* **Unwanted/ Negative Cycle:** Meet someone → Believe your emotions come from them and make them responsible for how you feel → Judge them and need them to be different → They feel rejected and back off to feel their freedom → You move on → They come back and/ or you meet someone new who’s also not a match to what you want.
* **Wanted/ Positive Cycle:** Meet someone → Know your emotions come from you, so you let them off the hook for how you feel → Appreciate them → They feel supported and free to be themselves → They stay and/ or you meet someone new who’s a better match to what you want.

*.*

# Honeymoon Phase

The honeymoon phase is created when you **focus more on what you like.** It wears off after you learn more about them because **when you know more specifics, you focus more on (and judge) what you don’t like.** So theoretically, you could always be in the honeymoon phase if you only focused on what you appreciated about them.

**How you feel now being single is how you’ll feel in the relationship** (and vice versa). But people typically believe a relationship will magically make them happy; that’s the illusion of the honeymoon phase. But **even if your life changes, you would still believe somewhere else is more important than where you are** (i.e. grass is greener). **So you will feel lonely, frustrated and disappointed no matter what.** And after you try and fail enough times, that’s why you feel stuck attracting the same unfulfilling relationships.

*.*

# Falling in Love Too Fast

You quickly get attached because **you don’t give yourself enough appreciation;** so their affection feels like a refreshing cold glass of water when you’ve been stuck in the desert (e.g. **love bombing is only effective when you don’t love yourself**). Which can be a projection in response to trauma and/ or emotionally unavailable parents, and not because you genuinely know who they are as a person. **You’re in love with the idea of them.**

.

# Putting Them on a Pedestal

**You didn't put them up. They only appeared higher because you put yourself down.** Otherwise, you'd simply see them as equally worthy.

With limerence, you hold on to people whose behavior makes it clear they’re not interested in a mutually satisfying relationship (romantic or friendship); i.e. parasocial relationships (e.g. K-Pop idols, streamers and influences) and situationships you’ve put your life on hold waiting and hoping for it to become something more.

**You put people** **on a pedestal because you believe they create your emotions.** You bring yourself up by giving yourself what you really want; which is feeling better (i.e. judge less; accept and appreciate more).

.

# Signs

**People ask for signs because they feel insecure and need reassurance.** Seeking signs is seeking validation. Making your emotions dependent on signs is the same as making emotions dependent on people. Negative emotion is a sign to stop putting them on a pedestal. Physical signs can help, but **you’re always receiving signs in the form of emotions** (they're consistent; thus reliable).

* **You are worthy, loved and supported. And negative emotion is a sign you’re not allowing yourself to remember that.**

.

# Hot and Cold

&gt;**“Why is it the more I want them, the less they want me. But when I don’t care, they’re interested?”**

To clarify, *“When I’m interested, I need them to like me and* ***make my emotions dependent on them,*** *so I offer resistance and they lose interest. But when I don’t care, I don't need them to be different, so I allow them to like me.”* The push-pull dynamic only exists when you believe your emotions come from them. They’re **reflecting you’re being hot and cold;** with sometimes needing or relaxing. They have hot and cold behavior because you have hot and cold thoughts and beliefs.

&gt;**“He’s giving the silent treatment and won’t respond to texts.”**

That's a **reflection you're giving yourself the silent treatment.** People match your expectations of them. He’s not ignoring you; he’s responding to the expectation texts you don’t know you’re sending, *“I practice the limiting belief you’re not going to respond. So please ignore my texts until I focus on feeling better.”*

&gt;**“They’re indecisive of whether to get back together or not.”**

That’s a **reflection you're indecisive.** When you think about them being indecisive, you match their energy and play emotional follow the leader. When you’re waiting for them to decide how you should feel, that inevitably pushes them away.

.

# Ghosted

There’s multiple reasons why people ghost (and that’s a normal part of building relationships), but the issue is you feel ghosted.

* **When you feel ghosted by others, that’s a reflection you're ghosting yourself.**

You’re normally ghosted in other areas of your life and you don’t care. For ex: You see a cute cat or have a nice chat (that rhymes) with the cashier for a few minutes; they scamper off and never hear from them again. You’re not upset because you had no expectations of how they should be; you simply enjoyed the experience for what it is. **To stop ghosting yourself, you want to stop ghosting your negative emotions.** Communicate and create a supportive relationship with them.

.

# Feeling Loved

&gt;**“I’m never someone’s first choice in love.”**

That's a **reflection you aren't your first choice for someone to love.**

&gt;**“I can't seem to get people to fall in love with me.”**

Do you want to **feel loved** or **have someone love you?** If you want the first; you’ll get both. But if you need the second; you won’t get either.

* **If you need them to love you, you won't feel loved.** (Even if they do, you won't allow yourself to receive it.)
* **When you love yourself, you allow people to love you,** because you're not dependent on it. You don't care if they do, because you’re too busy appreciating yourself.

&gt;**“If I was in a relationship, I’d feel less lonely.”**

Yeah, temporarily (i.e. honeymoon phase). But **if you feel lonely now, you’ll feel lonely in the relationship. If you’re unhappy without them, you’ll be unhappy with them** (and vice versa). You’re craving intimacy and connection with yourself.

&gt;**“Why can other women get engaged, but not me?”**

You are engaged. **You’re engaged to the belief you’re not worthy and supported.** You’re engaged to believing you can’t have the relationship you want. And is that the kind of belief you want to get married to? Because there’s still time to call off the wedding haha. **Do you want to be in a loveless marriage with yourself?**

&gt;**“I do love myself. But why don’t they love me?”**

If you care, then you don't appreciate yourself as much as you could. **They don’t value you as much as you want, because you don’t value yourself as much as you deserve.**

&gt;**“Why do I care so much for jerks and men who aren’t right for me?”**

They’re playing a pivotal role **showing you how little you care about yourself.**

&gt;**“I loved them the best I could, but I see now they had their own issues and that’s why they broke up with me.”**

**Their capacity to receive love wasn’t about you. You were good enough, but they didn't feel good enough.** Both of you feeling loved has nothing to do with whether you’re loving each other, and has everything to do with whether you are allowing yourself to feel loved (i.e. loving yourself).

.

# Conditional vs Unconditional Love

When people want to move on they mean, *“How can I move forward knowing they won’t return the love I have for them?”* That lets you know you were giving love, so you’d receive it; love quid pro quo.

* **Conditional love** = **Give love so you can receive it.**
* **Unconditional love** = **Give love because it feels better.**

When you make your love conditional, you’re setting yourself up for heartbreak, because you have strings attached: *“I’ll love you, if you love me. But if you don’t, I’ll be upset.”* That causes breakups. You placed impossible expectations on them to behave only in ways you want so you can feel better (and to be fair, they probably have the same expectations). You don’t want giving love to be contingent on whether you receive it. Not to mention the simple fact you can’t control if, when or how much someone loves you. But you can control the love you give. If you feel worse when you love, you’re focused on lack. **Love feels good. Lack feels wack.**

It’s natural for you to love. You are love. Living, breathing love. And when you decide to hold back your true nature, you feel worse. Unconditional love says, *“I’m loving because it feels better; you just also happen to benefit from it. But I’m loving you for my own satisfaction. I don’t care if you love me or not. Me loving you isn’t dependent on you, because I already feel loved from myself.”*

.

# Getting vs Giving — Transactional Relationships

When you feel worse, you’re focused on what you can get from people (to fill the void). When you shift from getting to giving, then you don’t care how people feel about you.

* **Getting** = Feels **anxious, heavy and disempowering.** **Attached to an outcome.** Focused on lack and what you can't control.
* **Giving** = Feels **effortless, light and empowering.** **Attached to enjoying yourself and the journey.** Focused on abundance and what you can control.

Giving appreciates people as they are; getting is rejecting them. **Do you give to give? Or give to get? If you’re giving love to receive it, then you’re blocking love** (i.e. ulterior motive).

&gt;**“How is giving different from people pleasing?”**

**People pleasers are more focused on getting acceptance.** In business, are you focused on what you can get from customers, or what value can you give? And as a customer, which companies do you appreciate: ones that care more about getting money? Or giving you the best value and service? **Do you believe people are a delivery service for your emotional needs?** Because that will push everyone away. Getting makes people become your suppliers. You invest time and money into relationships to get people to treat you only in ways you want.

**Giving is unconditional; it has no expectations of how a person receives the gift** (thus no resentment if it’s not reciprocated). Their appreciation is nice, but not necessary for your enjoyment. I.e. *“I’m not giving love to get love. I’m giving love… to give love. That’s my gift to myself.* ***How you receive my gift is none of my business.*** ***What matters is I do it because it feels better for me.****”*

.

# Soulmates and Love of Your Life

**If you want to find your soulmate, look in a mirror. You are your soulmate.** You'll find your relationship, when you don't spend any time worrying when you're going to find them because you're too busy enjoying your life to notice or care. If people say, *”You complete me,”* what they mean is, *""I don't feel complete with myself.""* **You allow people to love you as much as you love yourself.** And then you allow the second love of your life.

.

# Feeling Confident and Worthy

The irony of not feeling confident is: **You feel confident... that you lack confidence.** Because if you lacked confidence in your ability to have a lack of confidence, then you wouldn't feel insecure.

* **You always feel confident and worthy of something — it's either what you want or don't want.**

You believe you deserve what you don't want (rejection), instead of what you want (acceptance). So the good news is, **you don't have to learn how to feel confident and worthy; you already do.** You’re just **redirecting the confidence and worthiness you already have** from what you don't want, to what you do want. And an easier way to feel worthy of what you want is:

* **You don't have to convince yourself you're worthy. You just want to stop convincing yourself you're unworthy.**

Think of it like holding a cork under water. Asking, *“How do I feel confident, worthy and love myself?""* is like asking, *""How do I get the cork to float?""* The solution is simple: You don't have to make it float. When you stop holding it down, it automatically floats. So you don't have to accept and appreciate yourself if it feels challenging. **If all you did was judge yourself less, then your feelings of confidence and worthiness would naturally begin to float.**

&gt;**""It's hard to be positive.""**

**You can’t always be positive, but you can always feel a little better.** It’s more practical; thus sustainable and empowering. Feeling better is anything that soothes you, gives you a sense of relief, or is fun and interesting.

&gt;**""I’d prefer not to lower my standards in relationships.""**

You're talking about standards of them, which are valid, but **raise your standards of yourself; of what you focus on and beliefs you practice.** Be less willing to judge, and accept and appreciate more.

&gt;**""How do you feel confident when people ask why you’re single?”**

What do you believe being single says about you as a person? I.e. *""I believe people think I’m not good enough. And* ***because they reject me, I'm also going to reject me.*** *I believe their opinion about my life is more important than my own.""*

.

# Trust Issues

&gt;**“I don’t trust myself.”**

**You never lack trust. You always trust something — it’s either what you want or don’t want.** It’s easy for you to trust. So to clarify, *“I trust that I don’t trust myself. I trust more in my ability to make decisions that get me what I don’t want, than what I want.”*

&gt;**“I have trust issues with my partner, despite them being super sweet and supportive.”**

That's a **reflection you don’t trust yourself.** You trust you don't know how to control your emotions, so it’s understandable why you don’t trust others; to feel safe from being blindsided and hurt.

&gt;**“It’s hard to believe men want a serious relationship.""**

When you don’t feel worthy, you view yourself as disposable; someone not worth keeping in their life as a valuable partner. **You accept the same behavior from others as a reflection of how you treat yourself.**

.

# Fear of Commitment — Why You’re Emotionally Unavailable

&gt;**“I only like guys who don't like me.""**

As odd as it sounds, **emotionally unavailable men feel safe.** You can trust and know what to expect: abandonment and heartbreak. But with available guys, it can feel uncomfortable because it's unknown, you feel unworthy, lack of freedom, and/ or you have to be authentic with them, but you're not even comfortable being authentic with yourself. **You pick men who don't make you a priority as a reflection you don’t make yourself a priority.**

&gt;**“I’m afraid of being in a relationship. I'm in a satisfying situationship, but I think it’s because there’s no risk of it becoming more serious.""**

You’re afraid of making your emotional stability based on another who will disappoint you. And you’re right. If you believe your emotions come from them, you will be disappointed. **Being emotionally unavailable is a defensive mechanism and safety net to protect your heart in case (which you believe is probable) you feel heartbroken.** Think of it like if you’re standing 10 ft. away from someone vs 1 ft. If you expect them to fart, then you naturally distance yourself to mitigate the damage to your nostrils.

&gt;**“Why is him being so open about being in love shutting me down emotionally?”**

You feel pressured to do the same but you're not ready, don’t feel worthy, and/ or believe if you fully open up you'll get hurt. But you don't have to be afraid if they leave, because you know you can feel better, which allows you to be open to love.

.

# Anxious and Avoidant Attachments, Fear of Abandonment and Self-Sabotage

&gt;**“I feel anxiety it won't work out (because it’s happened before), so I get clingy or distant.”**

**Feeling anxious attachment is being avoidant to yourself.** You don't feel anxiety they might leave. **You feel anxiety because you abandoned yourself;** and anxiety wants to help you reconnect.

**Fear of abandonment is actually faith in abandonment;** you’ve practiced more thoughts expecting people will leave, rather than stay. And you might sacrifice yourself in the hope someone will stay (i.e. people pleaser).

You grew up in an environment where you weren't with people who made you feel safe and supported, and some of your needs weren't met with your parents (i.e. your first relationship in the world). That causes your nervous system to basically always be on alert and assessing your environment for consistent reassurance (i.e. anxious and worried), and being in that state naturally makes you feel drained and exhausted.

You cling to feel secure, but that makes your partner feel less free. So they pull away to feel their freedom, which you interpret as losing interest, so you cling more… until eventually they feel more free by not being in the relationship. **You needing them to stay, ironically caused you to push them away.**

&gt;**“My boyfriend is so sweet and he’s too good for me. He deserves someone worthy of his love.""**

Shouldn’t that be his decision? You're making assumptions on his behalf and sabotaging yourself as a result. He's an adult. And if he chooses to be with you, then you want to **respect his decision that he believes you're worthy. A quality partner makes you uncomfortable because they’re a reminder** **you're not measuring up to your own ideals.** So to feel safe and free, you either have to improve your self-worth, leave, or convince them to leave.

**When you have a fear of rejection and abandonment, you can ironically reject them first before they reject you.** It feels more empowering to push someone away (i.e. you did it to them), than have them leave (i.e. they did it to you). You self-sabotage because you feel more secure in knowing things won’t work, than being constantly on edge, unsure of if or when something will go wrong.

* *“I have two options: Wait until the person I care about rejects me (which makes me feel powerless). Or take power into my own hands and force them to leave. And as painful as that is,* ***it's less painful to intentionally ruin a good thing, then try to live happily ever after while worried it won’t last.*** *Because if they left for no obvious reasons I provided (e.g. clingy, arguing, distancing, etc.), that means they left ME, and I wasn't good enough for them to stay. And that feeling is unbearable.* ***It feels better they left because of what I did, instead of for who I am.*** *I feel a little less powerless, and a little more secure over uncontrollable circumstances.”*

.

# Seeking Attention and Validation

&gt;**""Why am I so invisible? Some women complain their friends flirt with them and I get jealous. How do I stop seeking male validation?""**

**You're outsourcing your self-love and self-worth to other people.** And ironically, some women might feel the same. They feel invisible because their friends only see them as something pretty, but not as a person with intelligence, value and feelings. And so they may question their male friendships, *“Are they actually authentic friends?”* Wanting to be seen by others is a **reflection of wanting to be seen by yourself.** **You stop seeking male validation, when you start giving self-validation.** Everyone wants to feel validated; that's healthy. But if you don't give it to yourself, then you naturally look to get it from others.

&gt;**""Even if I get attention, will it ever be enough?""**

No. Think of it like pouring water into a cup with a hole in the bottom. No matter how much goes in (i.e. external validation), it’s always empty.

.

# People Pleasing

**You're a people pleaser because you're afraid of rejection.** You practice a double standard lack of respect for yourself: You don't want to hurt people's feelings, but you're willing to hurt your own. People pleasing is a roundabout way of pleasing yourself; i.e. ulterior motive: *“I feel uncomfortable if you're uncomfortable. So how can I be different, to make you feel better and earn your acceptance, so then I can feel better?”*

.

# Fear of Rejection

**You’re afraid of rejection because you reject yourself.** And **you want them to accept you to compensate for the acceptance you don't give yourself.**

**You’re rejecting yourself to prevent you from being rejected.** The irony is, you're taking the fear of the possibility of being rejected, and 100% guaranteeing rejection by judging yourself. You're turning uncertainty into certainty; to help you feel more empowered over uncontrollable circumstances.

**Rejection doesn't mean you're unworthy; it’s just a reflection you believe you are.** Otherwise, you’d understand rejection is a projection of someone's issues that has nothing to do with you (i.e. why do you care about being judged by someone who judges themselves?), and/ or **appreciate rejection as a redirection to something more compatible and fulfilling.** (Another way to view rejection is pre-acceptance.) Being vs feeling rejected are two different things:

* **Being Rejected:** They weren't interested. That's okay, it wasn't a match.
* **Feeling Rejected:** You interpret that as a reflection of your self-worth and come to the false conclusion something is wrong with you and you won’t be supported in having the relationships you want.

You can't control people's perceptions. But, **you can control your perception of their perception;** and that’s the only reason you feel rejected. Rejection feels bad because **you’re rejecting the feeling of rejection.** And **you’re rejecting them for rejecting you.** Which is why **fear of rejection is your projection of rejection.** Because if you accepted rejection, then you’d feel accepted and the fear goes away.

&gt;**“Fear holds me back from the life I want.""**

Fear doesn’t hold you back. Fear is a symptom of the problem (i.e. judgment); not the problem itself. Think of a car. Being upset with fear is like getting upset at your gas gauge for telling you you're low. **The indicator doesn't make you have less gas; it's just doing its job** (that you want it to do) of **telling you when to fill up** (i.e. take care of yourself). You're afraid of feeling fear. But **fear is loving guidance** that just wants to help you love yourself more.

.

# Intuition vs Anxiety — Stay or Go?

* **Intuition:** Feels light, interesting, exciting, empowering, comfortable, clear and obvious.
* **Anxiety:** Feels heavy, worry, doubt, fear, disempowering, uncomfortable and confusing.

You can have intuition, judge your intuition and then feel anxiety. If you decide to move on, focus on feeling better where you are first, and then leave (this also applies to jobs, home, etc.). Because if you leave feeling frustrated, then your next relationship will probably feel the same (and you’ll get stuck in an unwanted cycle). You’re not moving away from what you don’t want; you’re **moving towards what you want.**

.

# Sunk-Cost Fallacy

&gt;**“I don’t want to move on because of the time, effort and money I invested into the relationship; otherwise it feels like a waste.”**

Sunk-cost fallacy is one reason you hoard clothes and items, or why you go from losing $20 at a casino to losing $300. Nothing is a wasted experience. But, **let’s say you wasted two months or years on this relationship. Do you want to continue wasting another two months or years?**

You’re focused on what you lost, when there’s so much to gain by walking away (i.e. moving towards what you want). Sometimes, cutting your losses is the best thing for your mind, heart, watch and wallet. But **if you believe the other person needs to be different and creates your emotions, then you’ll willingly sabotage your present and future, for a past that’s meant to stay there.**

.

# Detach vs Live in the End

&gt;**""Should I detach and move on? Or live in the end and focus on them to come back?”**

It’s the same thing:

* **Detach = Focus on feeling better.**
* **Live in the end = Focus on feeling better.**

**Detaching = Letting go of resistance; not desire.** It's about **how you're focusing; not what you're focusing on.** So you can think about them, or anything else, as much as you want, as long as it feels better. Detaching and living in the end is remembering your emotions come from your thoughts about desire; not the desire itself. Also, **when you’re attached to needing a specific outcome, then you’re detached from yourself.**

.

# Heartbreak and Letting Go

**You feeling loved in the relationship is your job;** not theirs. The other person can’t make you feel loved, because they can’t control your thoughts. Which means the opposite is also true; **they didn’t break your heart. You did it to yourself, and gave them the credit** (and vice versa).

**Give yourself permission to grieve and feel what you need to** (i.e. sadness, anger, regret, etc.). How you feel is valid and it's a process. (And ironically, when you don't rush yourself, then you allow yourself to feel better faster.)

&gt;**“I miss them.”**

You’re not missing them, but how you felt when you were with them. You’re focused on their physical absence, instead of their emotional presence. You always have access to that connection, whether or not you’re in a relationship with them. And that connection feels better and is very respectful to the love you have for them.

**Heartbreak is really focusbreak: You broke your focus off of what you want.** Letting go can be hard because you believe you have to lose something important. So **an easier way to let go, is by letting in something else.**

* **Letting Go = Losing.** It’s focused on what you don’t want.
* **Letting In = Gaining.** It’s focused on what you want.

**What emotions and relationships do you want to let in?**

* *“I want to let in feeling accepted and appreciated. I want to let in more compassion for myself. I want to let in mutually satisfying relationships. And although I want to feel better, I understand it's a process, that might not happen overnight. But the emotional work I'm doing right now is enough to naturally guide me to feeling more of the support and comfort I'm looking for.""*

You’re not sad because the relationship ended. **You’re sad because you have a new relationship with yourself and others that’s ready to begin, and you’re not allowing it.** You could only feel that bad, because you’re depriving yourself of the good you deserve. You're incredibly strong and courageous. **You will come out of this better, stronger, healthier and with more love for yourself and others than you had before.** As you focus on flowing more love to yourself and the world, then you allow the world to find many, many, many ways of flowing love back to you.

.

# Closure and Moving On

&gt;**“How can someone move on so quickly and get another relationship after the previous one ends?”**

If they broke up with you, they made peace with their decision a while ago. And some distract themselves from negative emotions (and just attract another unfulfilling relationship; despite the honeymoon phase of cute photos on social media). While others appreciate you, which gave them clarity of what they want.

* **Closure =** ***""I need to know why, so I can move on.”*** Needing closure can be an ulterior motive, which keeps you stuck.

If they ghost you, **the fact they aren’t reaching out is all the closure you need; they’re not interested.**

Now, it’s possible to rekindle the relationship when you give them space. And sometimes people ghost because they don’t want to feel uncomfortable and hurt your feelings (because some people don’t handle rejection well). **You empower yourself to move on when you stop looking back to** **someone else** **so you can feel closure.**

Let's say I waved a magic wand *\*poof\** and you got closure. **What could they say that would help you feel closure?**

* *“I appreciate everything you did for me. I made a mistake. I didn't love myself, so I sought validation outside the relationship. It's not your fault. I was just dealing with my own unhealed trauma and insecurities. I was scared to tell you I wasn't happy. So to save both of us from pain, I avoided those conversations, and I betrayed your trust.* ***I'm sorry I hurt you. I was wrong. You are worthy, beautiful, and deserve respect and understanding.****”*
* *“I didn’t leave because you’re not great to be with. And it’s not that you scared me away.* ***I left because I’m not a match to the relationship of your dreams. I’m not a match to the relationship I helped you create.*** *It was because of my unwanted aspects that gave you clarity of new desires. Nothing’s gone wrong. Everything is working out for you. You can appreciate the time we spent together, while also being excited for the new relationship that’s just right for you. And maybe that relationship can be with me again. But* ***be open to allowing whoever is the best match to what you want to effortlessly come into your life.****”*

# Tips on How to Get the Relationship You Want

**1. Be Friends with Your Negative Thoughts and Emotions.**

Be open to **treating negative thoughts and emotions with kindness, humor and respect.** Welcome them into your home as **honored guests.** You’re creating a new relationship with yourself, so you become a partner, and not a prisoner. And sometimes when I can’t soothe myself, **I invite negative emotions to come along and join me in whatever I’m doing, so they don’t feel rejected or abandoned. They feel included,** and that helps me feel better. This work is about holistic integration — including all parts of you.

* *""Hey! What are you here to teach me? I want to be open to the idea you guys are my friends. I may not believe it yet, but I at least like the thought you want to support me. Negative thoughts and emotions, I know we haven't had the best relationship in the past, but are you open to working together? And maybe consider going easier on me as we figure out this new relationship? That'd be nice. I'd like that. So take a seat, get comfortable... Can I get you a drink? I got some snacks. And I’m inviting over some better-feeling thoughts and emotions to hang out as well.""*

.

**2. Be Friends with Your Body.**

Tune in to how your body feels; be aware of felt sense (e.g. do parts of your body feel warm, hot, cold, pressure, hollow, tense, relaxed, etc.). **Communicate with your body and ask if your friend needs anything** (e.g. more water, sleep, healthier diet, meditation, grounding, intentional breathing, exercise, connecting with nature, and physical touch; e.g. hug yourself or a pillow, or hand on your heart). Also **explore creative outlets to express yourself** (e.g. dancing, singing, writing, drawing, painting, etc.).

.

**3. Have No Expectations In Needing a Specific Outcome — Let Go of Ulterior Motives.**

* **Ulterior motive:** *“I believe my emotions come from outside of me. So I want to change my circumstances and other people, so then I can feel better.”*

Focus on feeling better with no expectation it needs to lead to a specific outcome (which paradoxically is the best way to allow it or something better). **Action is for satisfaction; not attraction.** Take action for the satisfaction of the process and act itself; not as means to make something happen. View dating less as trying to get something from someone, and more as showing up authentically and enjoying the experience for what it is.

Also, you might already know the type of relationship you want. So, **you’re not necessarily being guided to more clarity of your desire** (i.e. you know what you want)**, but clarity to soothe yourself to be a match to your desire** (i.e. drop the judgment, appreciate and expect you will get what you want, and not need it to happen in a specific way).

.

**4. Self-Reflection Questions:**

* *“What am I afraid would happen if my partner was emotionally available?”*
* *“What am I afraid would happen if I was emotionally available?”*
* *“What am I afraid would happen if I was in a mutually satisfying relationship?”*
* *“What am I afraid would happen if I let someone fully love me?”*
* *“Am I afraid of receiving? Am I uncomfortable receiving equal love, support and understanding from people? If so, why?”*
* *“Am I attracted to people who need fixing? So in an unhealthy relationship my role is to fix people. But what is my role in a mutually satisfying relationship?”*
* *“Am I emotionally unavailable because I believe a relationship means I have less freedom to be myself? Do I believe people have expectations of me to be a certain way? If I do, why?""*
* *“Do I outsource my self-love and self-worth to other people? Do I need people to love me so I can feel loved? If I do, why?”*
* *“Do I believe my satisfaction and fulfillment in life can only happen if I'm in a relationship with this specific person? If I do, why do I practice that limiting belief?”*
* *“Do I accept and appreciate people as they are? If I don't, why do I need them to be different?”*
* *“Do I expect people to treat me differently than how I treat myself? If so, why do I practice that double standard? That it's okay for me to judge and abandon myself, but it's not okay for other people to be a reflection of my lack of self-care.”*

.

* *“Do I judge myself? If I do, why? Why am I so hard on myself?”*
* *“What am I afraid would happen if I didn't judge myself?”*
* *“What are the advantages of judging myself? It's a good thing because ...”*
* *“What am I afraid would happen if I took full ownership of my emotions?”*
* *“What am I afraid would happen if I let go of the past, stopped worrying about the future, and focused on the present?”*
* *“What am I afraid would happen if I let myself feel satisfied now, have fun and enjoy the journey with dating and relationships?”*
* *“What am I afraid would happen if I accepted and appreciated my life just the way it is, and didn't need it to be different?”*
* *“What am I afraid would happen if I accepted and appreciated myself just the way I am?”*
* *“What did I learn about myself from this relationship so I can become a more understanding, appreciative and supportive person to myself and others?”*

.

**5. Focus on What You Want.**

**Why do you want a relationship? What do you want to feel?**

* *""I want to feel supported, heard and validated. I want to feel accepted, appreciated and valued. I want to feel loved for who I am. I like feeling loved. I want to feel connected to people who understand me. I want to feel freedom to be myself. I want to feel romantic. I want to feel attractive, beautiful and sexy. I want to have fun and be playful. I want to feel adventurous. I want to feel passionate. And I really like feeling eager and excited, and allowing the life and mutually satisfying relationships I want.""*

As you **allow those better-feelings to be enough** (and don't demand specific answers from yourself right now), then you empower yourself to be ready and open for new clarity, guidance and opportunities that allow the relationships you want.

&lt;p&gt;_____________&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;strong&gt;You feel lonely, rejected, and attract emotionally unavailable relationships because you judge yourself&lt;/strong&gt; (and others). It’s a &lt;strong&gt;reflection you’re emotionally unavailable with yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; When you feel ghosted by others, that’s a reflection you&amp;#39;re ghosting yourself. As odd as it sounds, &lt;strong&gt;emotionally unavailable men feel safe. Fear of abandonment is actually faith in abandonment;&lt;/strong&gt; expecting people will leave, than stay. And to find your soulmate, look in a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ulterior motives cause relationship issues&lt;/strong&gt; (and that’s not a judgement; just clarity for awareness). I.e. &lt;em&gt;“I believe my emotions come from outside of me. So I want to change my circumstances and other people, so then I can feel better.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You feeling loved in the relationship is your job;&lt;/strong&gt; not theirs. The other person can’t make you feel loved, because they can’t control your thoughts. You&amp;#39;re afraid of feeling fear. But &lt;strong&gt;fear is loving guidance&lt;/strong&gt; that just wants to help you love yourself more. You’re sad because you have a new relationship with yourself and others that’s ready to begin, and you’re not allowing it. As you &lt;strong&gt;focus on flowing more love to yourself and the world, then you allow the world to find many ways of reflecting back your self-love to you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this post is long, so feel free to skip around to just what you’re interested in.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_____________&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative emotions are positive guidance&lt;/strong&gt; (although it might not feel that way) letting you know you’re focusing on (and judging) what you don&amp;#39;t want. &lt;strong&gt;Negative emotions are just messengers&lt;/strong&gt; of limiting beliefs you&amp;#39;re practicing. They&amp;#39;re a necessary part of your emotional guidance; like GPS in your car. But the more you avoid or fight them, you keep yourself stuck. &lt;strong&gt;All emotions are equal and worthy.&lt;/strong&gt; But people unknowingly create a hierarchy for their emotions (i.e. positive = good; negative = bad). As you start seeing &lt;strong&gt;negative emotions as worthy and supportive friends,&lt;/strong&gt; then you work together as a team to help you emotionally connect with yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your emotions come from your thoughts;&lt;/strong&gt; they don&amp;#39;t come from your circumstances or other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you &lt;strong&gt;focus on what you want&lt;/strong&gt; = You &lt;strong&gt;feel better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you &lt;strong&gt;focus on (and invalidate or judge) what you don&amp;#39;t want&lt;/strong&gt; = You &lt;strong&gt;feel worse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s empowering to know because then you have the freedom and ability to feel better, if you want to. And hypothetically, &lt;strong&gt;if you never judged anything&lt;/strong&gt; (which isn’t realistic, but this is just an example), &lt;strong&gt;you would never feel negative emotion.&lt;/strong&gt; Isn’t that interesting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Cycles of Feeling Stuck in Relationships&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s why you’re stuck attracting primates instead of prime mates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unwanted/ Negative Cycle:&lt;/strong&gt; Meet someone → Believe your emotions come from them and make them responsible for how you feel → Judge them and need them to be different → They feel rejected and back off to feel their freedom → You move on → They come back and/ or you meet someone new who’s also not a match to what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wanted/ Positive Cycle:&lt;/strong&gt; Meet someone → Know your emotions come from you, so you let them off the hook for how you feel → Appreciate them → They feel supported and free to be themselves → They stay and/ or you meet someone new who’s a better match to what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Honeymoon Phase&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The honeymoon phase is created when you &lt;strong&gt;focus more on what you like.&lt;/strong&gt; It wears off after you learn more about them because &lt;strong&gt;when you know more specifics, you focus more on (and judge) what you don’t like.&lt;/strong&gt; So theoretically, you could always be in the honeymoon phase if you only focused on what you appreciated about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you feel now being single is how you’ll feel in the relationship&lt;/strong&gt; (and vice versa). But people typically believe a relationship will magically make them happy; that’s the illusion of the honeymoon phase. But &lt;strong&gt;even if your life changes, you would still believe somewhere else is more important than where you are&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. grass is greener). &lt;strong&gt;So you will feel lonely, frustrated and disappointed no matter what.&lt;/strong&gt; And after you try and fail enough times, that’s why you feel stuck attracting the same unfulfilling relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Falling in Love Too Fast&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You quickly get attached because &lt;strong&gt;you don’t give yourself enough appreciation;&lt;/strong&gt; so their affection feels like a refreshing cold glass of water when you’ve been stuck in the desert (e.g. &lt;strong&gt;love bombing is only effective when you don’t love yourself&lt;/strong&gt;). Which can be a projection in response to trauma and/ or emotionally unavailable parents, and not because you genuinely know who they are as a person. &lt;strong&gt;You’re in love with the idea of them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Putting Them on a Pedestal&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You didn&amp;#39;t put them up. They only appeared higher because you put yourself down.&lt;/strong&gt; Otherwise, you&amp;#39;d simply see them as equally worthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With limerence, you hold on to people whose behavior makes it clear they’re not interested in a mutually satisfying relationship (romantic or friendship); i.e. parasocial relationships (e.g. K-Pop idols, streamers and influences) and situationships you’ve put your life on hold waiting and hoping for it to become something more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You put people&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;on a pedestal because you believe they create your emotions.&lt;/strong&gt; You bring yourself up by giving yourself what you really want; which is feeling better (i.e. judge less; accept and appreciate more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Signs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People ask for signs because they feel insecure and need reassurance.&lt;/strong&gt; Seeking signs is seeking validation. Making your emotions dependent on signs is the same as making emotions dependent on people. Negative emotion is a sign to stop putting them on a pedestal. Physical signs can help, but &lt;strong&gt;you’re always receiving signs in the form of emotions&lt;/strong&gt; (they&amp;#39;re consistent; thus reliable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are worthy, loved and supported. And negative emotion is a sign you’re not allowing yourself to remember that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hot and Cold&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Why is it the more I want them, the less they want me. But when I don’t care, they’re interested?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify, &lt;em&gt;“When I’m interested, I need them to like me and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;make my emotions dependent on them,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;so I offer resistance and they lose interest. But when I don’t care, I don&amp;#39;t need them to be different, so I allow them to like me.”&lt;/em&gt; The push-pull dynamic only exists when you believe your emotions come from them. They’re &lt;strong&gt;reflecting you’re being hot and cold;&lt;/strong&gt; with sometimes needing or relaxing. They have hot and cold behavior because you have hot and cold thoughts and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“He’s giving the silent treatment and won’t respond to texts.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a &lt;strong&gt;reflection you&amp;#39;re giving yourself the silent treatment.&lt;/strong&gt; People match your expectations of them. He’s not ignoring you; he’s responding to the expectation texts you don’t know you’re sending, &lt;em&gt;“I practice the limiting belief you’re not going to respond. So please ignore my texts until I focus on feeling better.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“They’re indecisive of whether to get back together or not.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a &lt;strong&gt;reflection you&amp;#39;re indecisive.&lt;/strong&gt; When you think about them being indecisive, you match their energy and play emotional follow the leader. When you’re waiting for them to decide how you should feel, that inevitably pushes them away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ghosted&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s multiple reasons why people ghost (and that’s a normal part of building relationships), but the issue is you feel ghosted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you feel ghosted by others, that’s a reflection you&amp;#39;re ghosting yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re normally ghosted in other areas of your life and you don’t care. For ex: You see a cute cat or have a nice chat (that rhymes) with the cashier for a few minutes; they scamper off and never hear from them again. You’re not upset because you had no expectations of how they should be; you simply enjoyed the experience for what it is. &lt;strong&gt;To stop ghosting yourself, you want to stop ghosting your negative emotions.&lt;/strong&gt; Communicate and create a supportive relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Feeling Loved&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I’m never someone’s first choice in love.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a &lt;strong&gt;reflection you aren&amp;#39;t your first choice for someone to love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I can&amp;#39;t seem to get people to fall in love with me.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to &lt;strong&gt;feel loved&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;have someone love you?&lt;/strong&gt; If you want the first; you’ll get both. But if you need the second; you won’t get either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you need them to love you, you won&amp;#39;t feel loved.&lt;/strong&gt; (Even if they do, you won&amp;#39;t allow yourself to receive it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you love yourself, you allow people to love you,&lt;/strong&gt; because you&amp;#39;re not dependent on it. You don&amp;#39;t care if they do, because you’re too busy appreciating yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If I was in a relationship, I’d feel less lonely.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, temporarily (i.e. honeymoon phase). But &lt;strong&gt;if you feel lonely now, you’ll feel lonely in the relationship. If you’re unhappy without them, you’ll be unhappy with them&lt;/strong&gt; (and vice versa). You’re craving intimacy and connection with yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Why can other women get engaged, but not me?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are engaged. &lt;strong&gt;You’re engaged to the belief you’re not worthy and supported.&lt;/strong&gt; You’re engaged to believing you can’t have the relationship you want. And is that the kind of belief you want to get married to? Because there’s still time to call off the wedding haha. &lt;strong&gt;Do you want to be in a loveless marriage with yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I do love myself. But why don’t they love me?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you care, then you don&amp;#39;t appreciate yourself as much as you could. &lt;strong&gt;They don’t value you as much as you want, because you don’t value yourself as much as you deserve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Why do I care so much for jerks and men who aren’t right for me?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re playing a pivotal role &lt;strong&gt;showing you how little you care about yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I loved them the best I could, but I see now they had their own issues and that’s why they broke up with me.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their capacity to receive love wasn’t about you. You were good enough, but they didn&amp;#39;t feel good enough.&lt;/strong&gt; Both of you feeling loved has nothing to do with whether you’re loving each other, and has everything to do with whether you are allowing yourself to feel loved (i.e. loving yourself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conditional vs Unconditional Love&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people want to move on they mean, &lt;em&gt;“How can I move forward knowing they won’t return the love I have for them?”&lt;/em&gt; That lets you know you were giving love, so you’d receive it; love quid pro quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conditional love&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;Give love so you can receive it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unconditional love&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;Give love because it feels better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you make your love conditional, you’re setting yourself up for heartbreak, because you have strings attached: &lt;em&gt;“I’ll love you, if you love me. But if you don’t, I’ll be upset.”&lt;/em&gt; That causes breakups. You placed impossible expectations on them to behave only in ways you want so you can feel better (and to be fair, they probably have the same expectations). You don’t want giving love to be contingent on whether you receive it. Not to mention the simple fact you can’t control if, when or how much someone loves you. But you can control the love you give. If you feel worse when you love, you’re focused on lack. &lt;strong&gt;Love feels good. Lack feels wack.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s natural for you to love. You are love. Living, breathing love. And when you decide to hold back your true nature, you feel worse. Unconditional love says, &lt;em&gt;“I’m loving because it feels better; you just also happen to benefit from it. But I’m loving you for my own satisfaction. I don’t care if you love me or not. Me loving you isn’t dependent on you, because I already feel loved from myself.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Getting vs Giving — Transactional Relationships&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you feel worse, you’re focused on what you can get from people (to fill the void). When you shift from getting to giving, then you don’t care how people feel about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting&lt;/strong&gt; = Feels &lt;strong&gt;anxious, heavy and disempowering.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Attached to an outcome.&lt;/strong&gt; Focused on lack and what you can&amp;#39;t control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving&lt;/strong&gt; = Feels &lt;strong&gt;effortless, light and empowering.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Attached to enjoying yourself and the journey.&lt;/strong&gt; Focused on abundance and what you can control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving appreciates people as they are; getting is rejecting them. &lt;strong&gt;Do you give to give? Or give to get? If you’re giving love to receive it, then you’re blocking love&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. ulterior motive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“How is giving different from people pleasing?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People pleasers are more focused on getting acceptance.&lt;/strong&gt; In business, are you focused on what you can get from customers, or what value can you give? And as a customer, which companies do you appreciate: ones that care more about getting money? Or giving you the best value and service? &lt;strong&gt;Do you believe people are a delivery service for your emotional needs?&lt;/strong&gt; Because that will push everyone away. Getting makes people become your suppliers. You invest time and money into relationships to get people to treat you only in ways you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving is unconditional; it has no expectations of how a person receives the gift&lt;/strong&gt; (thus no resentment if it’s not reciprocated). Their appreciation is nice, but not necessary for your enjoyment. I.e. &lt;em&gt;“I’m not giving love to get love. I’m giving love… to give love. That’s my gift to myself.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you receive my gift is none of my business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What matters is I do it because it feels better for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Soulmates and Love of Your Life&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to find your soulmate, look in a mirror. You are your soulmate.&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#39;ll find your relationship, when you don&amp;#39;t spend any time worrying when you&amp;#39;re going to find them because you&amp;#39;re too busy enjoying your life to notice or care. If people say, &lt;em&gt;”You complete me,”&lt;/em&gt; what they mean is, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t feel complete with myself.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You allow people to love you as much as you love yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; And then you allow the second love of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Feeling Confident and Worthy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony of not feeling confident is: &lt;strong&gt;You feel confident... that you lack confidence.&lt;/strong&gt; Because if you lacked confidence in your ability to have a lack of confidence, then you wouldn&amp;#39;t feel insecure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You always feel confident and worthy of something — it&amp;#39;s either what you want or don&amp;#39;t want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You believe you deserve what you don&amp;#39;t want (rejection), instead of what you want (acceptance). So the good news is, &lt;strong&gt;you don&amp;#39;t have to learn how to feel confident and worthy; you already do.&lt;/strong&gt; You’re just &lt;strong&gt;redirecting the confidence and worthiness you already have&lt;/strong&gt; from what you don&amp;#39;t want, to what you do want. And an easier way to feel worthy of what you want is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to convince yourself you&amp;#39;re worthy. You just want to stop convincing yourself you&amp;#39;re unworthy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of it like holding a cork under water. Asking, &lt;em&gt;“How do I feel confident, worthy and love myself?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; is like asking, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;How do I get the cork to float?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; The solution is simple: You don&amp;#39;t have to make it float. When you stop holding it down, it automatically floats. So you don&amp;#39;t have to accept and appreciate yourself if it feels challenging. &lt;strong&gt;If all you did was judge yourself less, then your feelings of confidence and worthiness would naturally begin to float.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s hard to be positive.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can’t always be positive, but you can always feel a little better.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s more practical; thus sustainable and empowering. Feeling better is anything that soothes you, gives you a sense of relief, or is fun and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;I’d prefer not to lower my standards in relationships.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re talking about standards of them, which are valid, but &lt;strong&gt;raise your standards of yourself; of what you focus on and beliefs you practice.&lt;/strong&gt; Be less willing to judge, and accept and appreciate more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;How do you feel confident when people ask why you’re single?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you believe being single says about you as a person? I.e. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I believe people think I’m not good enough. And&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;because they reject me, I&amp;#39;m also going to reject me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I believe their opinion about my life is more important than my own.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Trust Issues&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I don’t trust myself.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You never lack trust. You always trust something — it’s either what you want or don’t want.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s easy for you to trust. So to clarify, &lt;em&gt;“I trust that I don’t trust myself. I trust more in my ability to make decisions that get me what I don’t want, than what I want.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I have trust issues with my partner, despite them being super sweet and supportive.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a &lt;strong&gt;reflection you don’t trust yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; You trust you don&amp;#39;t know how to control your emotions, so it’s understandable why you don’t trust others; to feel safe from being blindsided and hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s hard to believe men want a serious relationship.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you don’t feel worthy, you view yourself as disposable; someone not worth keeping in their life as a valuable partner. &lt;strong&gt;You accept the same behavior from others as a reflection of how you treat yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Fear of Commitment — Why You’re Emotionally Unavailable&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I only like guys who don&amp;#39;t like me.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As odd as it sounds, &lt;strong&gt;emotionally unavailable men feel safe.&lt;/strong&gt; You can trust and know what to expect: abandonment and heartbreak. But with available guys, it can feel uncomfortable because it&amp;#39;s unknown, you feel unworthy, lack of freedom, and/ or you have to be authentic with them, but you&amp;#39;re not even comfortable being authentic with yourself. &lt;strong&gt;You pick men who don&amp;#39;t make you a priority as a reflection you don’t make yourself a priority.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I’m afraid of being in a relationship. I&amp;#39;m in a satisfying situationship, but I think it’s because there’s no risk of it becoming more serious.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re afraid of making your emotional stability based on another who will disappoint you. And you’re right. If you believe your emotions come from them, you will be disappointed. &lt;strong&gt;Being emotionally unavailable is a defensive mechanism and safety net to protect your heart in case (which you believe is probable) you feel heartbroken.&lt;/strong&gt; Think of it like if you’re standing 10 ft. away from someone vs 1 ft. If you expect them to fart, then you naturally distance yourself to mitigate the damage to your nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Why is him being so open about being in love shutting me down emotionally?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You feel pressured to do the same but you&amp;#39;re not ready, don’t feel worthy, and/ or believe if you fully open up you&amp;#39;ll get hurt. But you don&amp;#39;t have to be afraid if they leave, because you know you can feel better, which allows you to be open to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Anxious and Avoidant Attachments, Fear of Abandonment and Self-Sabotage&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I feel anxiety it won&amp;#39;t work out (because it’s happened before), so I get clingy or distant.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling anxious attachment is being avoidant to yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; You don&amp;#39;t feel anxiety they might leave. &lt;strong&gt;You feel anxiety because you abandoned yourself;&lt;/strong&gt; and anxiety wants to help you reconnect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of abandonment is actually faith in abandonment;&lt;/strong&gt; you’ve practiced more thoughts expecting people will leave, rather than stay. And you might sacrifice yourself in the hope someone will stay (i.e. people pleaser).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You grew up in an environment where you weren&amp;#39;t with people who made you feel safe and supported, and some of your needs weren&amp;#39;t met with your parents (i.e. your first relationship in the world). That causes your nervous system to basically always be on alert and assessing your environment for consistent reassurance (i.e. anxious and worried), and being in that state naturally makes you feel drained and exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cling to feel secure, but that makes your partner feel less free. So they pull away to feel their freedom, which you interpret as losing interest, so you cling more… until eventually they feel more free by not being in the relationship. &lt;strong&gt;You needing them to stay, ironically caused you to push them away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“My boyfriend is so sweet and he’s too good for me. He deserves someone worthy of his love.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shouldn’t that be his decision? You&amp;#39;re making assumptions on his behalf and sabotaging yourself as a result. He&amp;#39;s an adult. And if he chooses to be with you, then you want to &lt;strong&gt;respect his decision that he believes you&amp;#39;re worthy. A quality partner makes you uncomfortable because they’re a reminder&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;you&amp;#39;re not measuring up to your own ideals.&lt;/strong&gt; So to feel safe and free, you either have to improve your self-worth, leave, or convince them to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you have a fear of rejection and abandonment, you can ironically reject them first before they reject you.&lt;/strong&gt; It feels more empowering to push someone away (i.e. you did it to them), than have them leave (i.e. they did it to you). You self-sabotage because you feel more secure in knowing things won’t work, than being constantly on edge, unsure of if or when something will go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I have two options: Wait until the person I care about rejects me (which makes me feel powerless). Or take power into my own hands and force them to leave. And as painful as that is,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;it&amp;#39;s less painful to intentionally ruin a good thing, then try to live happily ever after while worried it won’t last.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Because if they left for no obvious reasons I provided (e.g. clingy, arguing, distancing, etc.), that means they left ME, and I wasn&amp;#39;t good enough for them to stay. And that feeling is unbearable.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It feels better they left because of what I did, instead of for who I am.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I feel a little less powerless, and a little more secure over uncontrollable circumstances.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Seeking Attention and Validation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Why am I so invisible? Some women complain their friends flirt with them and I get jealous. How do I stop seeking male validation?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#39;re outsourcing your self-love and self-worth to other people.&lt;/strong&gt; And ironically, some women might feel the same. They feel invisible because their friends only see them as something pretty, but not as a person with intelligence, value and feelings. And so they may question their male friendships, &lt;em&gt;“Are they actually authentic friends?”&lt;/em&gt; Wanting to be seen by others is a &lt;strong&gt;reflection of wanting to be seen by yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You stop seeking male validation, when you start giving self-validation.&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone wants to feel validated; that&amp;#39;s healthy. But if you don&amp;#39;t give it to yourself, then you naturally look to get it from others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Even if I get attention, will it ever be enough?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Think of it like pouring water into a cup with a hole in the bottom. No matter how much goes in (i.e. external validation), it’s always empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;People Pleasing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#39;re a people pleaser because you&amp;#39;re afraid of rejection.&lt;/strong&gt; You practice a double standard lack of respect for yourself: You don&amp;#39;t want to hurt people&amp;#39;s feelings, but you&amp;#39;re willing to hurt your own. People pleasing is a roundabout way of pleasing yourself; i.e. ulterior motive: &lt;em&gt;“I feel uncomfortable if you&amp;#39;re uncomfortable. So how can I be different, to make you feel better and earn your acceptance, so then I can feel better?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Fear of Rejection&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re afraid of rejection because you reject yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; And &lt;strong&gt;you want them to accept you to compensate for the acceptance you don&amp;#39;t give yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re rejecting yourself to prevent you from being rejected.&lt;/strong&gt; The irony is, you&amp;#39;re taking the fear of the possibility of being rejected, and 100% guaranteeing rejection by judging yourself. You&amp;#39;re turning uncertainty into certainty; to help you feel more empowered over uncontrollable circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejection doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re unworthy; it’s just a reflection you believe you are.&lt;/strong&gt; Otherwise, you’d understand rejection is a projection of someone&amp;#39;s issues that has nothing to do with you (i.e. why do you care about being judged by someone who judges themselves?), and/ or &lt;strong&gt;appreciate rejection as a redirection to something more compatible and fulfilling.&lt;/strong&gt; (Another way to view rejection is pre-acceptance.) Being vs feeling rejected are two different things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being Rejected:&lt;/strong&gt; They weren&amp;#39;t interested. That&amp;#39;s okay, it wasn&amp;#39;t a match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling Rejected:&lt;/strong&gt; You interpret that as a reflection of your self-worth and come to the false conclusion something is wrong with you and you won’t be supported in having the relationships you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t control people&amp;#39;s perceptions. But, &lt;strong&gt;you can control your perception of their perception;&lt;/strong&gt; and that’s the only reason you feel rejected. Rejection feels bad because &lt;strong&gt;you’re rejecting the feeling of rejection.&lt;/strong&gt; And &lt;strong&gt;you’re rejecting them for rejecting you.&lt;/strong&gt; Which is why &lt;strong&gt;fear of rejection is your projection of rejection.&lt;/strong&gt; Because if you accepted rejection, then you’d feel accepted and the fear goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Fear holds me back from the life I want.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear doesn’t hold you back. Fear is a symptom of the problem (i.e. judgment); not the problem itself. Think of a car. Being upset with fear is like getting upset at your gas gauge for telling you you&amp;#39;re low. &lt;strong&gt;The indicator doesn&amp;#39;t make you have less gas; it&amp;#39;s just doing its job&lt;/strong&gt; (that you want it to do) of &lt;strong&gt;telling you when to fill up&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. take care of yourself). You&amp;#39;re afraid of feeling fear. But &lt;strong&gt;fear is loving guidance&lt;/strong&gt; that just wants to help you love yourself more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Intuition vs Anxiety — Stay or Go?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intuition:&lt;/strong&gt; Feels light, interesting, exciting, empowering, comfortable, clear and obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety:&lt;/strong&gt; Feels heavy, worry, doubt, fear, disempowering, uncomfortable and confusing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have intuition, judge your intuition and then feel anxiety. If you decide to move on, focus on feeling better where you are first, and then leave (this also applies to jobs, home, etc.). Because if you leave feeling frustrated, then your next relationship will probably feel the same (and you’ll get stuck in an unwanted cycle). You’re not moving away from what you don’t want; you’re &lt;strong&gt;moving towards what you want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sunk-Cost Fallacy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I don’t want to move on because of the time, effort and money I invested into the relationship; otherwise it feels like a waste.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunk-cost fallacy is one reason you hoard clothes and items, or why you go from losing $20 at a casino to losing $300. Nothing is a wasted experience. But, &lt;strong&gt;let’s say you wasted two months or years on this relationship. Do you want to continue wasting another two months or years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re focused on what you lost, when there’s so much to gain by walking away (i.e. moving towards what you want). Sometimes, cutting your losses is the best thing for your mind, heart, watch and wallet. But &lt;strong&gt;if you believe the other person needs to be different and creates your emotions, then you’ll willingly sabotage your present and future, for a past that’s meant to stay there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Detach vs Live in the End&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Should I detach and move on? Or live in the end and focus on them to come back?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the same thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detach = Focus on feeling better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live in the end = Focus on feeling better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detaching = Letting go of resistance; not desire.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s about &lt;strong&gt;how you&amp;#39;re focusing; not what you&amp;#39;re focusing on.&lt;/strong&gt; So you can think about them, or anything else, as much as you want, as long as it feels better. Detaching and living in the end is remembering your emotions come from your thoughts about desire; not the desire itself. Also, &lt;strong&gt;when you’re attached to needing a specific outcome, then you’re detached from yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Heartbreak and Letting Go&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You feeling loved in the relationship is your job;&lt;/strong&gt; not theirs. The other person can’t make you feel loved, because they can’t control your thoughts. Which means the opposite is also true; &lt;strong&gt;they didn’t break your heart. You did it to yourself, and gave them the credit&lt;/strong&gt; (and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give yourself permission to grieve and feel what you need to&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. sadness, anger, regret, etc.). How you feel is valid and it&amp;#39;s a process. (And ironically, when you don&amp;#39;t rush yourself, then you allow yourself to feel better faster.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I miss them.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not missing them, but how you felt when you were with them. You’re focused on their physical absence, instead of their emotional presence. You always have access to that connection, whether or not you’re in a relationship with them. And that connection feels better and is very respectful to the love you have for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heartbreak is really focusbreak: You broke your focus off of what you want.&lt;/strong&gt; Letting go can be hard because you believe you have to lose something important. So &lt;strong&gt;an easier way to let go, is by letting in something else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letting Go = Losing.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s focused on what you don’t want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letting In = Gaining.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s focused on what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What emotions and relationships do you want to let in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I want to let in feeling accepted and appreciated. I want to let in more compassion for myself. I want to let in mutually satisfying relationships. And although I want to feel better, I understand it&amp;#39;s a process, that might not happen overnight. But the emotional work I&amp;#39;m doing right now is enough to naturally guide me to feeling more of the support and comfort I&amp;#39;m looking for.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not sad because the relationship ended. &lt;strong&gt;You’re sad because you have a new relationship with yourself and others that’s ready to begin, and you’re not allowing it.&lt;/strong&gt; You could only feel that bad, because you’re depriving yourself of the good you deserve. You&amp;#39;re incredibly strong and courageous. &lt;strong&gt;You will come out of this better, stronger, healthier and with more love for yourself and others than you had before.&lt;/strong&gt; As you focus on flowing more love to yourself and the world, then you allow the world to find many, many, many ways of flowing love back to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Closure and Moving On&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“How can someone move on so quickly and get another relationship after the previous one ends?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they broke up with you, they made peace with their decision a while ago. And some distract themselves from negative emotions (and just attract another unfulfilling relationship; despite the honeymoon phase of cute photos on social media). While others appreciate you, which gave them clarity of what they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closure =&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I need to know why, so I can move on.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Needing closure can be an ulterior motive, which keeps you stuck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they ghost you, &lt;strong&gt;the fact they aren’t reaching out is all the closure you need; they’re not interested.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s possible to rekindle the relationship when you give them space. And sometimes people ghost because they don’t want to feel uncomfortable and hurt your feelings (because some people don’t handle rejection well). &lt;strong&gt;You empower yourself to move on when you stop looking back to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;someone else&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;so you can feel closure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say I waved a magic wand &lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;poof** and you got closure. &lt;strong&gt;What could they say that would help you feel closure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I appreciate everything you did for me. I made a mistake. I didn&amp;#39;t love myself, so I sought validation outside the relationship. It&amp;#39;s not your fault. I was just dealing with my own unhealed trauma and insecurities. I was scared to tell you I wasn&amp;#39;t happy. So to save both of us from pain, I avoided those conversations, and I betrayed your trust.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry I hurt you. I was wrong. You are worthy, beautiful, and deserve respect and understanding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I didn’t leave because you’re not great to be with. And it’s not that you scared me away.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I left because I’m not a match to the relationship of your dreams. I’m not a match to the relationship I helped you create.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It was because of my unwanted aspects that gave you clarity of new desires. Nothing’s gone wrong. Everything is working out for you. You can appreciate the time we spent together, while also being excited for the new relationship that’s just right for you. And maybe that relationship can be with me again. But&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;be open to allowing whoever is the best match to what you want to effortlessly come into your life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tips on How to Get the Relationship You Want&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Be Friends with Your Negative Thoughts and Emotions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be open to &lt;strong&gt;treating negative thoughts and emotions with kindness, humor and respect.&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome them into your home as &lt;strong&gt;honored guests.&lt;/strong&gt; You’re creating a new relationship with yourself, so you become a partner, and not a prisoner. And sometimes when I can’t soothe myself, &lt;strong&gt;I invite negative emotions to come along and join me in whatever I’m doing, so they don’t feel rejected or abandoned. They feel included,&lt;/strong&gt; and that helps me feel better. This work is about holistic integration — including all parts of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hey! What are you here to teach me? I want to be open to the idea you guys are my friends. I may not believe it yet, but I at least like the thought you want to support me. Negative thoughts and emotions, I know we haven&amp;#39;t had the best relationship in the past, but are you open to working together? And maybe consider going easier on me as we figure out this new relationship? That&amp;#39;d be nice. I&amp;#39;d like that. So take a seat, get comfortable... Can I get you a drink? I got some snacks. And I’m inviting over some better-feeling thoughts and emotions to hang out as well.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Be Friends with Your Body.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tune in to how your body feels; be aware of felt sense (e.g. do parts of your body feel warm, hot, cold, pressure, hollow, tense, relaxed, etc.). &lt;strong&gt;Communicate with your body and ask if your friend needs anything&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. more water, sleep, healthier diet, meditation, grounding, intentional breathing, exercise, connecting with nature, and physical touch; e.g. hug yourself or a pillow, or hand on your heart). Also &lt;strong&gt;explore creative outlets to express yourself&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. dancing, singing, writing, drawing, painting, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Have No Expectations In Needing a Specific Outcome — Let Go of Ulterior Motives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ulterior motive:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;“I believe my emotions come from outside of me. So I want to change my circumstances and other people, so then I can feel better.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on feeling better with no expectation it needs to lead to a specific outcome (which paradoxically is the best way to allow it or something better). &lt;strong&gt;Action is for satisfaction; not attraction.&lt;/strong&gt; Take action for the satisfaction of the process and act itself; not as means to make something happen. View dating less as trying to get something from someone, and more as showing up authentically and enjoying the experience for what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you might already know the type of relationship you want. So, &lt;strong&gt;you’re not necessarily being guided to more clarity of your desire&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. you know what you want)&lt;strong&gt;, but clarity to soothe yourself to be a match to your desire&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. drop the judgment, appreciate and expect you will get what you want, and not need it to happen in a specific way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Self-Reflection Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What am I afraid would happen if my partner was emotionally available?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What am I afraid would happen if I was emotionally available?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What am I afraid would happen if I was in a mutually satisfying relationship?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What am I afraid would happen if I let someone fully love me?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Am I afraid of receiving? Am I uncomfortable receiving equal love, support and understanding from people? If so, why?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Am I attracted to people who need fixing? So in an unhealthy relationship my role is to fix people. But what is my role in a mutually satisfying relationship?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Am I emotionally unavailable because I believe a relationship means I have less freedom to be myself? Do I believe people have expectations of me to be a certain way? If I do, why?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Do I outsource my self-love and self-worth to other people? Do I need people to love me so I can feel loved? If I do, why?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Do I believe my satisfaction and fulfillment in life can only happen if I&amp;#39;m in a relationship with this specific person? If I do, why do I practice that limiting belief?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Do I accept and appreciate people as they are? If I don&amp;#39;t, why do I need them to be different?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Do I expect people to treat me differently than how I treat myself? If so, why do I practice that double standard? That it&amp;#39;s okay for me to judge and abandon myself, but it&amp;#39;s not okay for other people to be a reflection of my lack of self-care.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Do I judge myself? If I do, why? Why am I so hard on myself?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What am I afraid would happen if I didn&amp;#39;t judge myself?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What are the advantages of judging myself? It&amp;#39;s a good thing because ...”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What am I afraid would happen if I took full ownership of my emotions?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What am I afraid would happen if I let go of the past, stopped worrying about the future, and focused on the present?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What am I afraid would happen if I let myself feel satisfied now, have fun and enjoy the journey with dating and relationships?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What am I afraid would happen if I accepted and appreciated my life just the way it is, and didn&amp;#39;t need it to be different?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What am I afraid would happen if I accepted and appreciated myself just the way I am?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What did I learn about myself from this relationship so I can become a more understanding, appreciative and supportive person to myself and others?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Focus on What You Want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you want a relationship? What do you want to feel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I want to feel supported, heard and validated. I want to feel accepted, appreciated and valued. I want to feel loved for who I am. I like feeling loved. I want to feel connected to people who understand me. I want to feel freedom to be myself. I want to feel romantic. I want to feel attractive, beautiful and sexy. I want to have fun and be playful. I want to feel adventurous. I want to feel passionate. And I really like feeling eager and excited, and allowing the life and mutually satisfying relationships I want.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you &lt;strong&gt;allow those better-feelings to be enough&lt;/strong&gt; (and don&amp;#39;t demand specific answers from yourself right now), then you empower yourself to be ready and open for new clarity, guidance and opportunities that allow the relationships you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ BFree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share your thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt; What’s one step you’re going to take to start feeling emotionally available with yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"It’s a bit difficult for me to explain how I feel but I hope this makes sense and someone can give me some advice on what I can do since it’s a lot of weight on my shoulders.

For as long as I can remember I’ve never felt good about myself. The way I look and my personality. This gives me anxiety when I go out in public and I feel like people are looking at me and judging me. Which is everything that I’m making up in my own head and I end up being very harsh to myself. 


These are some examples to explain myself a bit better since I’m pretty bad at it

I’ve also never been in a relationship. I’ve never had a girl show me any interest and this makes me view myself even worse. I feel like I’m unwanted and ugly. 
When I go to parties with my friends they ask me why I don’t speak to any girls but it’s because I feel like they will think I’m ugly and not want to speak to me. This gives me an anxiety as well since if I do speak to them since I’m telling myself in my head very negative thought about myself. This makes me feel so lonely since I’m 22yrs old and never has a gf. There are times where I wish I wasn’t alone and had someone 

If my friends or someone Ik makes a comment towards me which is usually a joke I can’t help but overthink about it for ages literal weeks to the point where I feel like I just annoy the friends I’m with and they just put up with me and would do much better without me. The problem is I love being around people so this doesn’t help. 


These are examples of what makes my feel like shit but on a daily basis I am my own bully. The way I speak to myself no one else speaks to me like this. I’m constantly judging myself my and putting myself down. I hate myself and idk what to do. Sometimes my thought go too far and I feel like I have no one to speak to. I use to cry about hating myself like why is my life like this, why I am like this and why do I look like this but now I’ve gotten to a point where I don’t cry. I even write messages to myself on my whiteboard sometimes to remind myself that no one cares about me and I’m just lonely in this world.
This gives anxiety and depression. I’ve not been a doctor about this but I feel like I’m just putting it on and feeling this way for no reason esp when I see other people post on here I feel like my problems aren’t very big

,Anxietyhelp,"For example: My partner usually works 5pm-12am. Sometimes he has to stay late. Its 2:21am and I haven't heard from him in almost 2 hours. He usually tells me when he's clocking out and heading home, as he works about 15 miles outside of town and drives like that, especially at night, make me anxious. 

So there's a few likely reasons I may not have heard from him yet - they got busy at close and he's still wrapping things up and hasn't been on his phone, maybe he's having an afterwork drink with a coworker, maybe his phone died and he forgot a charger, maybe he just forgot to message me tonight and is on his way right now. 

But here's where my brain is stuck at: he's dead. He crashed his car and he's either dead or slowly, painfully dying. I should call 911 because the sooner they find him, the higher the chance he'll make it. OR maybe he's cheating on me, maybe there was a new girl at work tonight or he saw a cute customer and went back to her cabin. OR maybe he got too drunk at the bar on the way home and got arrested (unlikely, I've been keeping an eye on the jail roster). OR maybe he's had enough of my shit and he's decided to ghost me. 

I know logically most of the things in the second list are very unlikely. But its not just with my partner and its all the time. If my sister doesn't message me until later in the day I spend all morning wondering if she got hurt or if she's been incapacitated somehow or if she just doesn't like me anymore. 

When I was a kid, it was always my parents. We lived about 30 minutes outside of town and I would lose my mind if anyone tried to go to town without me, I felt like I needed to be with them to keep them safe (like a good luck charm). 

But now, that doesn't help even. My anxiety has gotten to the point where even short car rides to the grocery store or even the bank 6 blocks from my house make me super nervous. I can hardly handle road trips anymore. When my partner wants to go for a drive it feels like my options are to either go with and be an anxious wreck the whole time or stay home and be an anxious wreck the whole time. 

It even happens with my cats. My cats have been acting up a lot so sometimes I lock them out of my bedroom. If they get too quiet, I become convinced that they hurt or killed themselves in someway and I basically have to go find them and see them for myself to get rid of the feeling.

,Anxietyhelp,"I'm 27, live in Canada and I've only started getting my deivers license this year. I've always been super anxious, stressed and scared of driving both because I'm afraid ill make a mistake and because I'm afraid of how badly others drive.

,Anxietyhelp,"I just want to share my story on how I overcame my anxiety.
For your preference, F(28) living abroad (still waiting for my PR) No job for 2 years, married, still no career path.

My anxiety started after my 2 weeks vacation with my husband, I just woke up in the morning without any plans and no motivation for everything. I just look at my Youtube channel the whole day and I didn’t know how to make videos again, I felt lost, restless, I lost interest of everything that I used to do, I was overthinking a lot, I spent a lot of time on social media and started comparing myself to the people I saw on it, I became more conscious about my physical appearance, I didn’t appreciate things around me, gatherings doesn’t excite me anymore,I felt like my friends doesn’t want to see me anymore, I felt so hopeless about my career, still don’t know what kind of job I wanted to get, it stresses me a lot and always ask myself “Why i don’t know what to do?”

It took me weeks to figured out how to heal myself and it turned out that I was also experiencing “QuarterLifeCrisis”. I checked videos on social media like (Tiktok) and I saw a post regarding “How to overcome Quartelifecrisis” i watched it and it was a big help.

I  just realized how negative I was and the reason I have anxiety is that I always think about future possible bad scenarios.

In order to help myself out from misery and distress, I have to revised my daily routine and my perspective in life. 

These are the following:

1. Go for walks (as soon as you wake up)
2. Be patient
3. Acceptance
4. Discover new skills and hobbies
5. Disconnect toxic people
6. Love yourself
7. Focus on the present
8. Minimize social media
9. Appreciate small achievements
10. Watch inspirational videos
11. Stop comparing yourself
12. Appreciation
13. Always practice “Self Gratitude”
14. Stop putting a lot pressure on yourself 
15. Positive mindset

You will never be healed if you are always on your negative mindset.

,Anxietyhelp,"Some of you may have seen me comment this on a few posts, but I figured it is important enough to want to share more widespread.

I’ve struggled with severe anxiety and panic attacks since 2017, and this has been the only thing that has truly helped me. I’m kind of past the point that breathing exercises and calming music can help, especially because I have not let my anxiety effect my schooling and career so I am often in a position where I can’t pause for 5-10 minutes and do breathing exercises in silence, if I am at work or school. 

Basically, my tactic is to essentially shock my body into focusing on anything BUT the panic attack. I have a really hard time self regulating/ talking myself out of them, and I often experience a spiral into the attack that heightens if I think about it too much. This tactic basically forces me to stop that spiral. 

The way I shock my system is with pain, but not an extreme kind. I want temporary pain. I am not self harming, I am not doing something that causes long term damage. There are multiple ways to go about it, but I prefer using a peppermint essential oil stick from amazon. They’re cheap, small enough to fit in a purse or pocket or hand without others noticing, and the way I use it is I stick it in one nostril and breath in deeply and for an extended period of time, to the point where it causes my eyes to water. Peppermint essential oil is a pretty strong smell, so it happens easily. Usually it takes like 2 seconds, I stick it in, smell until my eyes water and it burns, and then puts it away. It shocks my system enough to the point that I am no longer focusing, intentionally or not intentionally, on the panic attack and what caused it. 

I’ve also used other tactics. Sour candy, like warheads, worked well. Slapping myself hard across the face was a 1 time thing and made me look insane, so I probably wouldn’t do it again (but it did work…) 

if you’re worried about looking weird while doing it, just tell people it’s one of the Vicks decongestant sticks, and you have allergies/ a cold. Or, say you’re nauseous and it helps!

This past year I’ve been in and out of the hospital multiple times for gallbladder issues, complications from that, and then something completely unrelated called vestibular neuritis which was just a complete coincidence. I have no more FMLA time and my managers openly make fun of me when people ask me if I can take their shifts or whatever because the managers no my attendance suck and I will say no to taking the shift because I can barely come to my own shifts. 

I think I am going through malnutrition because of my illness but it’s made my anxiety and depression spike so bad that I don’t know what’s real or not anymore. I feel paranoid like everyone at work hates me. At home I constantly think about all my coworkers and managers and how they interact with me and in what ways that means they hate me. I do this with customers too (I’m a cashier). I go through every interaction in my head and I criticize myself because I know I’m stupid and can’t say the right things or be funny or witty. 

Lately I can’t relax at all. I can’t sleep through the night and I’m eating less than what I was already eating. I can’t even eat solid food at all and somehow I am consuming less. I have only lost 10 lbs in 3 months so I have no idea how my mental state has declined so bad. I can feel my sanity slipping. I can’t control my emotions anymore. If I think of anything sad at all I will start crying and I can’t make myself stop. I feel like such a burden on everyone and so useless. I wasn’t having panic attacks for a whole year and now they are becoming frequent again. 

Today right before I clocked on I had a huge panic attack. Some people were very nice and helpful but my mind is telling me that they really hate me and that my managers are going to pull me in and fire me. That’s where the spiral starts.  

Then, my boyfriend will leave me because he will think of me as a burden and won’t want to support me anymore. 

Soon I’ll be evicted from my apartment with nowhere to go. 

I’ll be forced to give my 2 cats away. I can see it already I see putting them in the carriers oh god and I have to give them to someone and they’re so scared I don’t think Sylvie will be okay because she’s pretty feral 

I’m spiraling out of control the only solution I can see is the permanent one, how do I stop thinking this way? It’s the only one that makes sense?

,Anxietyhelp,"
It's been 7 months since I took my last Lexapro medication but I'm struggling with tons of neurological symptoms without any relief and I'm scared if I've caused any neurological damage.
To give a brief history, I was on Lexapro at 5mg alongside etizolam at 0.5mg since October 2020 after several months of my struggle with anxiety and panic issues which all subsided after starting this combination which worked really great with no side effects. I was all great mentally and physically and was doing well in my college life up until my graduation last year in july. It was around October 2023 when I had just started to experience weird symptoms such as, extreme thirstiness, tightness in throat, light headedness and dizziness which I first ignored but eventually started stressing around. At first, my doctor blamed my BP which used to be around 130/100 and prescribed me with BP medication but neither my BP nor my symptoms subsided.

I constantly felt head pressure alongside non rotational dizziness, a feeling of being off balance, or better say, walking on a boat 24 × 7. I couldn't understand what was going on and my GP blamed it on anxiety and increased the dosage of Lexapro from 5mg to 10mg.That's when things began to get worse. While my dizziness reduced mildly, i was now experiencing new symptoms, like muscle twitches all over body, myoclonic jerks all over body while trying to sleep which turned me insomniac, vivid dreams which felt  too real, severe postural hypotension upon standing, muscle tightness in chest, and severe constipation.

 At first I thought it was my body just adjusting to the new dosage but when there was no relief, I visited my GP and he reduced the dosage from 10mg, back to 5mg However despite this change, all these new symptoms didn't subside. Within a few weeks, I now started feeling muscle weakness all across my body, particularly in my arms and legs and then, tremors began to develop in my hands, particularly in my left hand, my legs, and also in my tongue, and also I felt mild chattering in teeth and jaw tightness. But the weirdest of all this was now this reduced touch sensation in both of my hands and fingers which developed from nowhere. I don't know how to explain this feeling but anything I touched just didn't feel the way it used to before. It shit scared me, causing me to visit neurologists and all blamed it on anxiety without acknowledging or even accepting it as any side effect.

 i visited a psychiatrist too who just brushed it off as an anxiety issue and replaced Lexapro with trintellix and added sleeping pills and continued etizolam.
I continued being on this new regime of medication for 3 months but there was just no relief. I visited another neurologist who did some basic tests and everything came negative and referred me to a neuro-psychiatrist who at max just said that perhaps my body is unable to accept more serotonin and discontinued the entire regime of medications and told to take Clonazepam assuring it to help me with tremors. However there has been no respite from it either.

Currently I'm still experiencing muscle twitches all over my body from past 7 months, along with myoclonic jerks in night tremors in my hands, legs, tongue, teeth, reduced touch sensation in both of my hands and tingling sensations. My dizziness too continues to date. It has reduced but not gone alongside the head pressure which gets painful at times. I still experience vivid dreams every night which aren't any sort of nightmare but just feel too real but weird as well. 

At this point, I'm just helpless and devastated, unable to understand what went wrong and what's going on. I've been struggling for the past 1 year almost running across wards of psychiatry, neurology and medicine but finding no relief, treatment or cure to any of my symptoms. No doctor is able to understand my situation, diagnose me and provide me with any treatment.The moment anyone hears that I've been on a psychiatric medication, they blame everything on just anxiety and refer to a psychiatrist and psychiatrists just don't admit that a medication could have caused all this.

They just brush me off with a new set of medications but not admit that a psychiatric medication itself has caused all this mess.
I used to be happy and full of life mentally and physically but now I'm just lost and devastated. I'm severely depressed cause I've just become absolutely dysfunctional in life because of my symptoms. I am unable to understand how a medication which probably millions of people take with few or no side of effects could cause so many symptoms in me.

At this point I'm just scared if I've caused any neurological degeneration which doctors are not able to diagnose and brush it off as anxiety. I don't know why I am writing this here, perhaps as a form of rant or just looking for answers in some way from people who could share their personal experiences, I mean I don't know. I'm just clueless and helpless.
I just want my life back, free from all these issues and I genuinely don't wish to be diagnosed with any neurological condition.
I am just 24 years old and I've a life ahead and already it seems to have crashed down.
I have lost my health, and my career due to my condition from the past one year. I just wish an end to all these. It's been too tough honestly. I was academically bright, social, outgoing, full of life, but now I'm just sick both mentally and physically, depressed and lost in life.
It's just too much for me now.
I wish an end to this. I want my health, my body and my mind back.

To give a brief history, I was on Lexapro at 5mg alongside etizolam at 0.5mg since October 2020 after several months of my struggle with anxiety and panic issues which all subsided after starting this combination which worked really great with no side effects. I was all great mentally and physically and was doing well in my college life up until my graduation last year in july. It was around October 2023 when I had just started to experience weird symptoms such as, extreme thirstiness, tightness in throat, light headedness and dizziness which I first ignored but eventually started stressing around. At first, my doctor blamed my BP which used to be around 130/100 and prescribed me with BP medication but neither my BP nor my symptoms subsided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I constantly felt head pressure alongside non rotational dizziness, a feeling of being off balance, or better say, walking on a boat 24 × 7. I couldn&amp;#39;t understand what was going on and my GP blamed it on anxiety and increased the dosage of Lexapro from 5mg to 10mg.That&amp;#39;s when things began to get worse. While my dizziness reduced mildly, i was now experiencing new symptoms, like muscle twitches all over body, myoclonic jerks all over body while trying to sleep which turned me insomniac, vivid dreams which felt  too real, severe postural hypotension upon standing, muscle tightness in chest, and severe constipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I thought it was my body just adjusting to the new dosage but when there was no relief, I visited my GP and he reduced the dosage from 10mg, back to 5mg However despite this change, all these new symptoms didn&amp;#39;t subside. Within a few weeks, I now started feeling muscle weakness all across my body, particularly in my arms and legs and then, tremors began to develop in my hands, particularly in my left hand, my legs, and also in my tongue, and also I felt mild chattering in teeth and jaw tightness. But the weirdest of all this was now this reduced touch sensation in both of my hands and fingers which developed from nowhere. I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain this feeling but anything I touched just didn&amp;#39;t feel the way it used to before. It shit scared me, causing me to visit neurologists and all blamed it on anxiety without acknowledging or even accepting it as any side effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i visited a psychiatrist too who just brushed it off as an anxiety issue and replaced Lexapro with trintellix and added sleeping pills and continued etizolam.
I continued being on this new regime of medication for 3 months but there was just no relief. I visited another neurologist who did some basic tests and everything came negative and referred me to a neuro-psychiatrist who at max just said that perhaps my body is unable to accept more serotonin and discontinued the entire regime of medications and told to take Clonazepam assuring it to help me with tremors. However there has been no respite from it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I&amp;#39;m still experiencing muscle twitches all over my body from past 7 months, along with myoclonic jerks in night tremors in my hands, legs, tongue, teeth, reduced touch sensation in both of my hands and tingling sensations. My dizziness too continues to date. It has reduced but not gone alongside the head pressure which gets painful at times. I still experience vivid dreams every night which aren&amp;#39;t any sort of nightmare but just feel too real but weird as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I&amp;#39;m just helpless and devastated, unable to understand what went wrong and what&amp;#39;s going on. I&amp;#39;ve been struggling for the past 1 year almost running across wards of psychiatry, neurology and medicine but finding no relief, treatment or cure to any of my symptoms. No doctor is able to understand my situation, diagnose me and provide me with any treatment.The moment anyone hears that I&amp;#39;ve been on a psychiatric medication, they blame everything on just anxiety and refer to a psychiatrist and psychiatrists just don&amp;#39;t admit that a medication could have caused all this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They just brush me off with a new set of medications but not admit that a psychiatric medication itself has caused all this mess.
I used to be happy and full of life mentally and physically but now I&amp;#39;m just lost and devastated. I&amp;#39;m severely depressed cause I&amp;#39;ve just become absolutely dysfunctional in life because of my symptoms.

,Anxietyhelp,"About a year and a half ago I got sick with a stomach bug, and after that ive had constant nausea, but no throwing up. I have had periods when i don’t have nausea, for example from january to april 2024, that was the time i was doing my internship aborad. Though i thought that leaving home and being completely on my own in a foreign country would probably make my anxiety worse and therefore the nausea worse, but that wasn’t the case.   
Doctors say its anxiety, cause yes i have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder earlier in my life and take medication for it. And to be honest i did develop emetophobia after the stomach bug, but now i don’t feel that fearful of throwing up. My doc also suggested we do a gastroscopy just to rule out anything serious, and the results were fine other than the sphincter between my oesophagus and stomach not closing completely, so GERD aka acid reflux was added to my diagnoses. That also could cause some nausea i know. But honestly theres so many things that are pointing towards anxiety but also so many things that are saying its not. And its honestly making me lose hope, i dont want to live the rest of my life feeling nauseous, i literally can’t do anything during that. For example the fact that the nausea miraculously disappeared for four months without changing the things i eat and etc, does point to anxiety. And so do the thoughts about when is the nausea going to come back. But like the nausea just comes randomly, i dont even feel anxious about anything. The level of nausea also changes during the day like a roller coaster, some times its mild with a weird feeling in my throat, sometimes its extreme and my stomach also feels “weak” (not wanting to touch it or move). And nothing is working really, i do meditation, i eat smaller meals, i drink ginger tea, i am taking 200mg of sertraline due to the anxiety disorder (the dose recently got switched from 150mg to 200mg because i was complaining that the nausea has been getting worse and comes on without a trigger), but nothing works. I can’t eat, i am losing weight, my relationships are being damaged, due to the fact that i am so tired and exhausted and want to sleep to not feel the nausea, ive missed classes, i dont have the energy to even clean anymore, i am completely losing hope. I do not want to live like this. Even the anti-nausea medications didnt really work. I haven’t touched them in a year, because to be honest the medication kicked in making nausea more mild but then give me the derealisation or feeling of unreality feeling, which was terrifying. That again i know points to anxiety, cause its like the anxiety is seeking a way to manifest through physical symptoms, so after taking the anti-nausea medication, which slightly reduced the nausea but then the anxiety had to find another way to make my life hell.   
I know ive said it a lot, but i am completely hopeless, because no home remedies or medication is helping me feel any relief from this feeling. Because who would want to live their life like that, not being able to go out or do things you love. Lots of the time i find myself looking at people and thinking about how they are feeling right now and not having to feel the nausea.

,Anxietyhelp,"I think I may have anxiety and it's really hurting my health. Please help to reassure me or offer truly helpful advice. I cannot currently handle things getting worse.

Context: I've always been a worrywart, e.g. stressing about the house burning down when on holiday, feeling sure I did something wrong if someone wants to talk to me etc. I have little habits that help, like saying a prayer, or lighting a candle at the chapel, or touching the head of my lucky statue.

It's been a very stressful period: my contract ended (academia), started looking for a new position, wrote a research proposal, was robbed etc.

I also made an administrative mistake regarding my unemployment (not USA) and PTO I still had. I freaked out and immediately notified the right authority of my mistake and asked them how to rectify it. I also made the mistake of telling my mother who immediately painted a picture of fraud investigations and severe penalties, which made my stress even worse.

I got a mail telling me to fill in some forms and send them by post, which I did. I got no reaction. I sent few mails and called to see whether  they had been received, but no reply. So I swung by the offices (generally discouraged), to be told by an employee that they never received my documents. I filled them out again, and was told it would take a few months and i would like have to pay back some money. I told him I just wanted to set things right asap.

Soon after, I was robbed and had to swing by with my new ID card. It was the same employee, who told me they had tried to call me twice (no notification on my phone, but that day I was in an area with poor reception). I showed him my call history to be sure he did not think I ignored them. 

He told me he looked into the issue and explained that my PTO could not be retrospectively entered into the system, but that i could set things right by ""taking it up now"" (without doing so), so that the remaining number of days would be correct, as that was most important. It did not make any difference otherwise (financially), so no need to pay back or something like that. I told him I would do so immediately before I started my new position at the end of the month. He told me that I could also do so afterwards, but I said that that did not seem fair to my new employer, so I would do it right then. 

I was really relieved for about half a day and then my stress came back in full swing. I did as he said, but in my mind I've had a horrible constant and insistant series of possible worst case scenarios (fraud allegiations, investigations, etc.), even though I followed the right steps!

I am not unused to this, but I have few things that tend to help and settle me, like re-reading my favourite book again. It happens a few times a year. But this time I can't turn it off. Nothing helps. I am obsessively worrying about it, i have no appetite, headaches, nightmares, am trembling, sometimes it feels like I will have a heart attack.

I even went back again to assure myself that I did it right. It was the same employee again. I showed him, but he seemed to have already forgotten about the entire thing and was a bit dismissive even? But he nodded when i showed him and went ""fine, fine"" and hummed aggreeingly. But now my stress is even worse. Now see scenarios where it's all some kind of elaborate trap that will spring to punish me for making a mistake, even though i know that realistically, i followed all the correct steps, immediately notified the right people, offered to show proof and make restitutions if needed etc. Besides, why would they give themselves more paperwork than needed? But I don't have anything in writing, only what they told me (admittedly in a room full of other people). But logical arguments are not working, my brain won't turn off and my health is really deteriorating. Two months of little sleep, constantly stressing, feeling like I will have a heart attack etc. are taking their toll. I've lost a lot of weight I cannot afford to loose. I don't know what to do and I'm scared and that is making everything even worse.

&lt;p&gt;Context: I&amp;#39;ve always been a worrywart, e.g. stressing about the house burning down when on holiday, feeling sure I did something wrong if someone wants to talk to me etc. I have little habits that help, like saying a prayer, or lighting a candle at the chapel, or touching the head of my lucky statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a very stressful period: my contract ended (academia), started looking for a new position, wrote a research proposal, was robbed etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made an administrative mistake regarding my unemployment (not USA) and PTO I still had. I freaked out and immediately notified the right authority of my mistake and asked them how to rectify it. I also made the mistake of telling my mother who immediately painted a picture of fraud investigations and severe penalties, which made my stress even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a mail telling me to fill in some forms and send them by post, which I did. I got no reaction. I sent few mails and called to see whether  they had been received, but no reply. So I swung by the offices (generally discouraged), to be told by an employee that they never received my documents. I filled them out again, and was told it would take a few months and i would like have to pay back some money. I told him I just wanted to set things right asap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after, I was robbed and had to swing by with my new ID card. It was the same employee, who told me they had tried to call me twice (no notification on my phone, but that day I was in an area with poor reception). I showed him my call history to be sure he did not think I ignored them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told me he looked into the issue and explained that my PTO could not be retrospectively entered into the system, but that i could set things right by &amp;quot;taking it up now&amp;quot; (without doing so), so that the remaining number of days would be correct, as that was most important. It did not make any difference otherwise (financially), so no need to pay back or something like that. I told him I would do so immediately before I started my new position at the end of the month. He told me that I could also do so afterwards, but I said that that did not seem fair to my new employer, so I would do it right then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really relieved for about half a day and then my stress came back in full swing. I did as he said, but in my mind I&amp;#39;ve had a horrible constant and insistant series of possible worst case scenarios (fraud allegiations, investigations, etc.), even though I followed the right steps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not unused to this, but I have few things that tend to help and settle me, like re-reading my favourite book again. It happens a few times a year. But this time I can&amp;#39;t turn it off. Nothing helps. I am obsessively worrying about it, i have no appetite, headaches, nightmares, am trembling, sometimes it feels like I will have a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even went back again to assure myself that I did it right. It was the same employee again. I showed him, but he seemed to have already forgotten about the entire thing and was a bit dismissive even? But he nodded when i showed him and went &amp;quot;fine, fine&amp;quot; and hummed aggreeingly. But now my stress is even worse. Now see scenarios where it&amp;#39;s all some kind of elaborate trap that will spring to punish me for making a mistake, even though i know that realistically, i followed all the correct steps, immediately notified the right people, offered to show proof and make restitutions if needed etc. Besides, why would they give themselves more paperwork than needed? But I don&amp;#39;t have anything in writing, only what they told me (admittedly in a room full of other people). But logical arguments are not working, my brain won&amp;#39;t turn off and my health is really deteriorating. Two months of little sleep, constantly stressing, feeling like I will have a heart attack etc. are taking their toll. I&amp;#39;ve lost a lot of weight I cannot afford to loose. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do and I&amp;#39;m scared and that is making everything even worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve started googling my symptoms and anxiety pops up frequently. Could someone please help and reassure me? How do I deal with this?&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxietyhelp,"So I have a couple things at play here.

I have generalized anxiety, as well as PMDD which means my anxiety levels are much higher the week before my period. I also suffer from health anxiety due to a very traumatic past few years in and out of the hospital in extreme pain.

Today I started having a panic attack at work. I was shaking I felt faint and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I went home and emailed my psychiatrist. I have been 1 my clonazepam as needed for 6+ months and it’s been very helpful for me up until my recent surgery (1.5 months ago). I was taking it as needed during recovery as well at the advice of my doctors and psychiatrist. 

So I take my ativan , and it just doesn’t work. An hour later I’m still shaking. My psychiatrist says I can take another so I do. I’m not shaking anymore but I also still feel very anxious on 2 mg. I take as needed because I am already anxious but I am just surprised having recently been switched to Ativan for hopefully better results that it’s not working. All my anxious thought patterns and behaviors are still raging rn.
