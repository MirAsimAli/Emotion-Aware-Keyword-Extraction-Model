###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,4,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2364,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2364,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1572360722.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.

,depression,"PS: I never got to do my Spanish homework on May 4th 2023.

Then.. The day we would be leaving the city forever came on May 6th 2023, we packed all our suitcases and left early in the morning around 7 AM and boarded the EMR 222 express service to London St. Pancras then I remember when we boarded the train quickly departed ( because its an express ) and I was unfortunate knowing I would never be able to see any of this again. Funny enough, when we were passing by the Airport parkway, I saw a Ryanair 737 at 500 feet en route to the nearest Airport ( I was a very huge aviation fan back then) and I remember being sort of happy. Then 2 hours later we arrived in London, and I remember we went downstairs to catch a Thameslink. We got off a few stops before that before heading into my first house… My mum had a friend who had 3 children and when we got into her small house, All I could think about was that this would be my life now…

Funny enough the pastoral team was dealing with us in my school and was concerned for me because our family was moving too much. You wouldn't even believe that my mum blocked ALL of them (she didn't block the school) then a few days later my mum got fed up of living with her friend so we went to a hotel and during   our time at that hotel my mum signed out of our old city and called my school saying I would never be returning back.

Suddenly, they alerted the pastoral team and such and we got a message saying to tell us our location (because my mum made us go into hiding) so nobody knew where we were which was super stupid of her. My mum said she would not be revealing where we are staying and would be blocking the number, which she did. At that time, my phone had issues with turning on so I couldn't get my phone to turn on so I could see what my friends had to say about me. And a few days later, I got the phone to work and I saw all the messages from my friends asking if I was alive and why I had suddenly disappeared and never come back.

I’ll never forget this text message from one of my friends.

“ At first, we thought you were sick, but then you never came back… “

I was really sad as well and even my crush who i talked to for 1-2 days just had completely ghosted me since then even though we had a strong relationship and friendship.

Then a few days later we moved to another hotel where we got a message saying that the police would be getting involved with our case, my mum blocked the number and ranted to her friends about how “crazy “ my old school was for doing something like this.

I honestly believe SHE is the crazy one! The person who can't settle down in a city for more than a year and has the urge to move and completely ghost everyone and expects everyone to comply with a mother with 2 kids just suddenly moving and nobody knows where she even is. Then a few days later, my mum said we would be staying with her friend's uncle and when we stayed there, after almost 2 months of not going to school, My

mum found us a school which I would be starting. I remember after we left the uncle's house to live in an Air B and B,  after a few days of living in this place we got a call from the uncle saying how 2 police officers requested for him to open the door and reveal where we were which of course we had long left before then.  Sadly this luck didn't really last long because a few days later a CPS ( social worker ) came frantically knocking at our door saying to open it up which a neighbour in the house opened it  up and she came in so worried and saying that it was NOT okay to completely disappear like this and the children were in so much danger. She then said to unblock her so we could proceed from there which my mum of course did because she didn't want to create a scene.

For reference, she did a 3-hour drive just to get to where we live which my mum said was “ so crazy of her “which honestly, I had no idea what to say. Then my autistic brother kept making “too much noise “which a few days later around the end of the month, we came to the house to see all our stuff had been packed up and put in boxes. This is when we realised that we would be homeless and had nowhere to stay. But my mum quickly booked another hotel which we stayed in for a couple of days. I remember after we were in that hotel, we moved into a huge air b and B but this time by ourselves and it felt like a mini house.

But in those 3 months that I was in that house. I started year 8 again in another school. I remember on the first day of starting, I wondered why I was there and cried a bit knowing I’d be stuck there for a long time. I’ll never forget one of the team members of the

school brought me into my class, and I was just looking around, I felt so scared, it was unreal. Of course, nobody wanted to talk to me or be my friend, and the person who was going to buddy up with me ignored me… So, I had to find my way around the school. I’ll never forget when it was lunch time, going from eating at a huge table where a small portion of everyone sitting there was my friend, to go to eating at an empty table with no friends and no one to talk to. I just remember looking out the window  and feeling a bit sad. Then  3 months later shortly after the summer holiday I was in year 9 after I had my 14th birthday and got my HP laptop,   our time staying there had run out,  and my mum this time was super broke in debt. And she barely had any other money to stay anywhere else. So she begged the council to help her find somewhere to stay and that's where our journey of living in hotels began. And ever since that day, We’ve been living in hotels. I still talk to my friends from my old school, and every month on the 5th and 6th, I take time to remember all my friends and everything I knew in that city.

So yeah, that was my story. Fast forward 4 months, I am in year 10 now, still have no friends, lost most of my contacts as we drifted away, and now I only have one close person who doesn't talk to me unless I post something really interesting on my snap story, I have no friends and I have become a lot more socially awkward and would rather stay home.

&lt;p&gt;Then.. The day we would be leaving the city forever came on May 6th 2023, we packed all our suitcases and left early in the morning around 7 AM and boarded the EMR 222 express service to London St. Pancras then I remember when we boarded the train quickly departed ( because its an express ) and I was unfortunate knowing I would never be able to see any of this again. Funny enough, when we were passing by the Airport parkway, I saw a Ryanair 737 at 500 feet en route to the nearest Airport ( I was a very huge aviation fan back then) and I remember being sort of happy. Then 2 hours later we arrived in London, and I remember we went downstairs to catch a Thameslink. We got off a few stops before that before heading into my first house… My mum had a friend who had 3 children and when we got into her small house, All I could think about was that this would be my life now…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny enough the pastoral team was dealing with us in my school and was concerned for me because our family was moving too much. You wouldn&amp;#39;t even believe that my mum blocked ALL of them (she didn&amp;#39;t block the school) then a few days later my mum got fed up of living with her friend so we went to a hotel and during   our time at that hotel my mum signed out of our old city and called my school saying I would never be returning back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, they alerted the pastoral team and such and we got a message saying to tell us our location (because my mum made us go into hiding) so nobody knew where we were which was super stupid of her. My mum said she would not be revealing where we are staying and would be blocking the number, which she did. At that time, my phone had issues with turning on so I couldn&amp;#39;t get my phone to turn on so I could see what my friends had to say about me. And a few days later, I got the phone to work and I saw all the messages from my friends asking if I was alive and why I had suddenly disappeared and never come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget this text message from one of my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ At first, we thought you were sick, but then you never came back… “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really sad as well and even my crush who i talked to for 1-2 days just had completely ghosted me since then even though we had a strong relationship and friendship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a few days later we moved to another hotel where we got a message saying that the police would be getting involved with our case, my mum blocked the number and ranted to her friends about how “crazy “ my old school was for doing something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly believe SHE is the crazy one! The person who can&amp;#39;t settle down in a city for more than a year and has the urge to move and completely ghost everyone and expects everyone to comply with a mother with 2 kids just suddenly moving and nobody knows where she even is. Then a few days later, my mum said we would be staying with her friend&amp;#39;s uncle and when we stayed there, after almost 2 months of not going to school, My&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mum found us a school which I would be starting. I remember after we left the uncle&amp;#39;s house to live in an Air B and B,  after a few days of living in this place we got a call from the uncle saying how 2 police officers requested for him to open the door and reveal where we were which of course we had long left before then.  Sadly this luck didn&amp;#39;t really last long because a few days later a CPS ( social worker ) came frantically knocking at our door saying to open it up which a neighbour in the house opened it  up and she came in so worried and saying that it was NOT okay to completely disappear like this and the children were in so much danger. She then said to unblock her so we could proceed from there which my mum of course did because she didn&amp;#39;t want to create a scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, she did a 3-hour drive just to get to where we live which my mum said was “ so crazy of her “which honestly, I had no idea what to say. Then my autistic brother kept making “too much noise “which a few days later around the end of the month, we came to the house to see all our stuff had been packed up and put in boxes. This is when we realised that we would be homeless and had nowhere to stay. But my mum quickly booked another hotel which we stayed in for a couple of days. I remember after we were in that hotel, we moved into a huge air b and B but this time by ourselves and it felt like a mini house.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Today, I turned twenty-eight, another year ticking by, the countdown of my twenties echoing louder.
It’s a quiet ache, aging with the world spinning around me, slipping closer to thirty as the years sink their teeth in, one by one. I’ve tried to wrap myself in the arms of people who never really fit, hoping that, if I just folded myself the right way, maybe we’d fit together. I’ve spent years convincing myself that settling would be enough, that I’d feel whole with someone who could be ‘close enough’ to love. But each goodbye echoed hollow, leaving nothing but questions—about my worth, my love, the person I am.

I question, in the quietest hours, if I am somehow unlovable—if every broken attempt at love has left me a little less whole, a little less deserving.

And there’s this gnawing thought, this creeping fear that I’ll be watching from the sidelines forever. That the love I keep waiting for is just a fantasy, a mirage on the horizon that I chase but can never hold.

,depression,"Hello, world.

So, let me tell you, life is wild right now. I'm basically a 35+ year-old unemployed programmer, and while I'm not exactly swimming in cash, I won't be buying a yacht anytime soon. I've been unemployed for about three months. Honestly, it's not my biggest concern. I'm just getting by, living with my amazing partner who's trying to motivate me, but I worry I'm draining her energy faster than a bad horror movie plot. It's a real balancing act, folks.

I know I should probably get some exercise, but motivation is tough when you're feeling down. Socializing? Forget about it. Even living with my amazing partner, I still feel like a hermit at this point. My daily routine? Pretty much just trying to figure something out. And don't even get me started on my habit of indulging in, well, questionable content, especially pornography. It's a vicious cycle I know I need to break, but every time I try, it feels like I'm swimming with concrete shoes. I know the steps to escape this loop, but actually taking them? That's another story.

Now, let's dive into my complicated relationship with booze and weed. Every night, I crack open a few beers (it could be 8, 12, anyway...) and light up a small joint, which is my little escape that helps me drift off to sleep. I always promise myself tomorrow will be the day I stop. Spoiler alert: tomorrow never comes. Without my nightly rituals, anxiety kicks in like an unwanted houseguest, bringing heavy breathing and existential dread along for the ride. On the rare nights I don't drink, maybe once or twice a week, I rely on Clonazepam just to help me sleep, prescribed by my doctor.

I've been dealing with generalized anxiety disorder and depression. I tried therapy (many times), but nothing seemed to stick. Right now, I'm just seeing a psychiatrist and taking prescribed medication. It's not perfect, but it's what I've got for now. Just to be clear, I'm in a bit of a dark place, but I'm not grappling with anything extreme. I just occasionally get intrusive thoughts that pop up like unwanted guests who refuse to leave.

Identity feels like a puzzle I can't quite solve, and self-knowledge seems like a faint light just out of reach, leaving me lost in the darkness, yeah, I know, dramatic, but it's true.

Oh, and let's talk about my epic inability to finish anything. Seriously, I've started more projects than I care to admit, whether it's learning the guitar, studying a language, or trying to adopt healthier habits. And guess what? They're all gathering dust. It's like I'm competing in the ""Most Disinterested Human"" Olympics, and spoiler alert: I'm winning. I do have a true interest: math and physics. But don't let that fool you; I've never been the star pupil. From a young age, I faced challenges in advancing in these areas, and they've always felt just out of reach. I'd love to dabble in data visualization, especially with fractals (Mandelbrot set and stuff like that) and chaos theory, using them just for fun alongside programming. But honestly, I don't even know where to start because of my blocking ability to organize myself and create study schedules.

And let's talk about food. I'm living on a diet of takeout and junk food, which not only leaves me feeling sluggish but also drains my wallet. I mean, I know I should probably eat healthier and save some cash, but putting it into practice? That's a whole different story. It's frustrating to watch my money disappear on overpriced takeout, all while I know I could be cooking something nutritious for a fraction of the cost. But when motivation is low, convenience often wins out, and here I am, throwing money away one greasy meal at a time.

I'm pursuing a tech diploma in programming, I think, to satisfy my ego, even though honestly, I don't really plan to show it to anyone since I've started and stopped multiple times. Right now, I'm diving into the ""Second Brain"" concept and the ""PARA"" method. It's all about organizing thoughts and information, which feels like a step in the right direction.

Look, I know I'm not exactly setting a great example here, but I'm hoping maybe someone out there can relate in some way. Maybe you've been through something similar and can share your story. I'm open to any suggestions, whether it's a book recommendation or just someone to chat with. If there's a professional in the field who can offer guidance, that would be even better. I'm not looking for miracles, just a little support.

I've been considering putting myself out there a bit more, maybe sharing some of these ramblings on my profile. Who knows? Maybe my awkward musings will resonate with someone else out there. And if not, at least I'll give my “unwanted guest” some company! I mean, if you're going to have intrusive thoughts, you might as well throw a party, right?

And I'm sure someone will say, ""Look on the bright side, you're already aware of the situation!"" Sure, awareness is a start, but let's be real, awareness alone doesn't solve everything.

Toward the end of the dream there were crowds and crowds of suffering people, and we were goven the chance to go into this room and find a solution to our problems, which was understood to be death. I went into the room, but then they told me that the price for this gift of death and end of suffering was that I would have to pierce my own tonsils with a pair of diamond studs.

,depression,"I’m (21M) wondering what the point of anything is anymore. As a kid I had so much more life, happiness, creativity, imagination, and curiosity for life. I don’t even feel like the same person anymore, all I feel is grief for the death of that kid. 

I feel empty almost everyday now, and the only emotions I feel are daily anxiety and sadness when I break down or have panic attacks in my room by myself.

For some context, I have absolutely zero family aside from a single parent who has their own issues. I also moved every year of my life, which I’m certain fucked up my development in some way. Add to that internet access since elementary school and you get me. I never learned to make connections with people, and I stopped trying after moving so often. Right now, I have zero friends, and I think this is best for me and everyone else. I feel like I was robbed of learning basic social skills and learning empathy. Now I feel like a waste product who’s only good for dissociating and staying out of trouble. My life feels like a mistake, there was no reason for me to born whatsoever aside from the propagation of more life.

I don’t feel positive emotions, and I wonder what’s wrong with me. Why can’t I just exist as a normal guy. I’m terribly anxious around others and sometimes force a smile until my face hurts badly. With people outside of classes I make a caricature of myself to make others at ease. Otherwise I’m terribly stiff and can’t even swallow around others. For some reason I also can’t make eye contact with people and I hate how this makes others feel uncomfortable. No one wants to be around a depressed, emotionless loser like me. The least I can do is take up as little space as possible, emotionally or otherwise, for others.

When I get home, my mask comes off. I don’t look in the mirror anymore because I constantly have this sick thousand yard stare on my face, and I’m also objectively ugly and not in a redeeming way. My face is shaped in a way that always makes me look depressed and wanting to kms, in addition to looking pathetic and weak. My true personality is undesirable, and I know that no one would ever want to be friends with me or have a relationship, since I wouldn’t either. 

Deep down, I’m a terribly selfish, lazy, and unkind person. I can’t imagine myself showing love to anyone in life, since I can barely show interest in others. I don’t feel affection to my own parent, since they worked long hours for most of my life. I’m told stories of how I used to cling to them as a kid when they went to work, but I can’t imagine that level of emotion anymore. I can intellectualize some sense “gratitude” for them, but I don’t really FEEL anything. I don’t even have a sense of what emotions are except for my private mental break downs. I think something is really wrong with me if I can’t feel emotions, and this bothers me everyday. I only “feel” some relief or positive emotion from a few things: listening to music, being in nature, and exercising. Even then, I’m scared that I’ll eventually lose these things too, and I barely do any of them anyway. And in the end, none of these things will pay the bills.

 I also struggle to do my coursework in college, the one thing I thought I had going for me. I sabotage my own health and get caught in a vicious cycle that only adds stress to my life in college. I still haven’t given up completely, but it’s hard when I’m always tired and empty to stay on top of classes.

Then I have to wonder, what’s next for me? Say that I scrape out a degree, get a decent paying job, then what? What I’ve accomplished then is just finding a way to continue sustaining my self through food, shelter, drink, while spending the rest of my life alone and crippled by anxiety.

,depression,"Ive gotten this advice a lot.
Im gonna be open. Im pretty bitter, miserable and depressed so if I dont come off as particularly nice its because being optimistic and hoping things will change only got me more disappointment and rejection to the point Ive essentially given up on life. I eat junk because im too cowardly for suicide and hope it will finish me off.
But anyway, I get told a lot to lower my standards

I get it, I tend to only be attracted to muscular, physically fit women. Ive also never had a relationship, a real one, at 40. At this point I feel the only way I will get any real relationship with physical attraction would be a fit woman. Let me explain.

People said lower my standards, looks dont matter, etc etc. and I didnt want to believe I was so shallow that I only cared about looks. Well I know I dont only care about looks, but it is important. Anyway I decided what could it hurt to date a few normal women right? So i tried. And they were nice enough but zero attraction. They wanted to be intimate but I couldnt do it. I avoided it because I didnt want any firsts to be with someone I didnt truly feel for, and for two, because I didnt want to use someone for just a physical experience to say I did so. I may be a lot of things but I dont use people . I thought maybe I could ignore it. But i couldnt even ignore muscular women existing. More actresses and athletes are muscular than ever and in the public eye, and every time I saw them, it made me resentful that I couldnt get that, that I settled. So I decided that for me being alone, while its painful, is better than with someone for the sake of it. I felt still alone and shitty because i had settled . Not that they are lesser, I mean in terms of what i find attractive. They were fine as personalities, i just guess i realised i needed both. Our lives dont last forever, i want one physically meaningful relationship at least. I want a first one to last basically.

It sucks because they are hard to find, and the few I have are usually rude or stuck up. Many ignore you outright unless you yourself are muscular, which I dont want to be myself, or rich. Thats not hating, thats just my experience with them. Here even, they just ignore you trying to talk to the few that actually come to reddit. Its frustrating.
Im not even going to lie, loneliness has made me grow bitter and resentful. I kind of resent more women arent muscular and most are plain in terms of body. I know thats wrong of me, and Id never mock anyone or make fun of them for not being muscular. But I hate how every woman Ive ever known or tried to date hasnt been what I wanted, whereas I see other guys who do get those women. I cant help compare them to the women I know and it makes me feel even worse. Even if I did date normal again, Id compare them to the women I do want, and feel shitty about a comparing them and b wishing they were more like them.
I feel like shit and alone but theres no help for me because no amount of anything I do or say can make a muscular woman interested in me. You cant fix how other people feel so im stuck.
Have you guys ever been given the advice to lower your standards? How did it work for you?",t2_1b1kg0fs5m,False,,0,False,“Lower your standards”,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,True,t3_1gct4ni,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1729971693.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ive gotten this advice a lot.
Im gonna be open. Im pretty bitter, miserable and depressed so if I dont come off as particularly nice its because being optimistic and hoping things will change only got me more disappointment and rejection to the point Ive essentially given up on life. I eat junk because im too cowardly for suicide and hope it will finish me off.
But anyway, I get told a lot to lower my standards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get it, I tend to only be attracted to muscular, physically fit women. Ive also never had a relationship, a real one, at 40. At this point I feel the only way I will get any real relationship with physical attraction would be a fit woman. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People said lower my standards, looks dont matter, etc etc. and I didnt want to believe I was so shallow that I only cared about looks. Well I know I dont only care about looks, but it is important. Anyway I decided what could it hurt to date a few normal women right? So i tried. And they were nice enough but zero attraction. They wanted to be intimate but I couldnt do it. I avoided it because I didnt want any firsts to be with someone I didnt truly feel for, and for two, because I didnt want to use someone for just a physical experience to say I did so. I may be a lot of things but I dont use people . I thought maybe I could ignore it. But i couldnt even ignore muscular women existing. More actresses and athletes are muscular than ever and in the public eye, and every time I saw them, it made me resentful that I couldnt get that, that I settled. So I decided that for me being alone, while its painful, is better than with someone for the sake of it. I felt still alone and shitty because i had settled . Not that they are lesser, I mean in terms of what i find attractive. They were fine as personalities, i just guess i realised i needed both. Our lives dont last forever, i want one physically meaningful relationship at least. I want a first one to last basically.&lt;/p&gt;

i'm a 22F lesbian. i dont have anything in particular to be sad about. my parents love me (despite them being homophobic but idec ab that anymore), i have a lot of friends, i have hobbies. but for the past 6 months or so i've just been feeling very empty, like there's some sort of hole in my chest (corny ik) and idk what started it at all. 

i hate being alone and i desire human interaction so i figured spending time with other people would make it better (and it did for some time) but now it doesn't rly work anymore. regardless of who i'm with and what i'm doing i'm always thinking ab how displeased i am with my life and the direction its going. i'm in med school and it's not bad, but i feel like the uni i go to is very disorganized and i dont feel challenged at all, and therefore i dont have much motivation to keep going. i'm not particularly interested anymore (which rly bums me out bc in my 3rd year i was having a blast- there was a lot of pressure and it was keeping me busy). reading, watching tv shows &amp; playing video games (which were my main ""hobbies"") dont have the same effect on me as they used to. i cant even listen to songs/read books/watch tv shows or movies that i used to like bc they remind me of better times and make me feel useless, like i'll never achieve or be like the characters im reading ab/watching etc. the only thing i rly love doing is rock climbing, i've started going more times a week than i used to.

i've tried so hard to think of what triggered this bout of hopelessness but i cant figure it out. at first i thought it was somehow linked to my (previous) debilitating eating disorder &amp; body dysmorphia, but recently i started working out and building muscle and it's boosted my confidence a little bit, but hasnt done much in the long run. and lately i've started to not have an appetite again (lost like 2kg in a little over a week lol)

i feel like one thing that could solve it is moving out of the country i live in, but im only fluent in romanian and english so id have to go to an english speaking country to practice medicine and thats kind of impossible rn.

i'm just embarrassed bc like. i dont have much to complain about. and im able to have fun and engage with others socially. i dont think im introverted at all. but i cant stop feeling like i have zero purpose, like my efforts amount to nothing, that i wont be happy no matter what i do. that im in my 5th year of med school and it feels like it's not what i was meant to do - i think i have the brain for it but i dont have the passion others have for it and i feel so ashamed. and on top pf that if i were to hypothetically drop out i still wouldnt know what to do, what id major in. i havent figured out what im most good at. 

i dont want to reveal any of this to my friends bc they all seem like they're doing great and it's bumming me out that i'm not, that i'd probably ruin their mood if i ever talked ab this. i've always been the loud comical &amp; cynical friend of the bunch and i feel like it's impossible for them to ever see me as ""sad"" or ""depressed"". i've also never been one to talk ab my feelings or emotions so i'm under the impression that they'd find it weird if i suddenly did. although, i will say, i've recently been told by my uni friends (i have a few different friend groups &amp; i spend most time with the uni one - which btw is another reason as to why i feel silly, like im surrounded by people most days of the week) that i dissociate/space out a lot and ignore what they say sometimes, but they dont seem to think its anything weird. i feel like sometimes im extremely annoying to them, its rly hard for me to detect sarcasm sometimes and i tend to also be blunt so im always like do they even like me??? the one thing that makes me happy is how they always tell me i'm rly funny and that i make them laugh, so ig theres that. but i can never tell concretely how they feel about me. other than that ive always felt like i was the outsider of any friend group (even in high school), the ugliest etc.

,depression,"Since the end of August, after coming from a summer holiday, my mom has been depressed and experiencing panic attacks and severe depression. The depression is not new - she has been under treatment for around 8 years with Escitalopram and Alprazolam.

For the past year she has been taking care of my 2-3 year old niece, spending 8-9 hours each working day at my sisters house. This was enjoyable and gave her purpose.

In April this year, she decided not to take her meds anymore in secret as she wanted to make sure she is present with her granddaughter (this is my reasoning). 

Stopping the medication was a bad idea and the depression came back, but now with panic attacks and anxiety so she went back on Escitalopram and Alprazolam for about 6 weeks, before she was switched to Venlafaxine 37.5mg, Aripiprazole and Alprazolam. Still she would never go out and would have severe panic attacks before going to the doctor or going outside. She was however talking, she was interested in what the doctor was saying and she was generally more present.

After going up to 75mg Venlafaxine for 2 weeks she had increased anxiety and panic episodes, so she tried Duloxetine, which gave her stomach aches, dizziness, nauseousness and in general made her feel bad with less intense, but constant anxiety.

Now she has been back on Venlafaxine 37.5mg, but is not feeling better and keeps questioning when she will feel better, if ever. She does not want to leave the house and does nothing except worry all day. No TV, no reading, nothing to get her mind of things. She sleeps or lies down and waits for the next doses of medicine, although they don't really improve, just numb her.

I don't live with my parents, but my dad is with her all day and I talk to them twice a day and visit as often as possible. Mom has always been a worrier, and one of her main concerns is not to worry the people around her. The doctor she has now is very communicative and I am in contact with her almost daily to give her details on how my mom feels. The problem is my mom gets anxious even about telling the doctor how she is doing so she tells me half truths or waits a few days to tell me how she really feels. She often misremembers or leaves out information (like the fact that her panic attacks are getting worse).

I am stuck between giving the doctor false information and not upsetting my mom too much by constantly asking and insisting to get as much information as possible. 

She seems a bit hopeless and is waiting for the drugs to make her feel better before she can resume any activity in her life that previously brought her joy. She does not really trust the doctor, but does not want to change her either. She is mainly afraid that whatever she tells the doctor will mean changes in her medication and prolong the process. She does not like to talk about herself and dislikes that the doctor asks her how they should proceed.

What do I do? Do I move in with my parents(although this worries her more) or push to change the doctor? Do I push to have patience and continue Venlafaxine?

1. For the most part of the month I typically feel genuinely depressed. I would say more than half the days . I think I’m just adjusted to it at the point. Usually what happens for me is that I end isolating myself from everyone at first . During these times I’m easily overwhelmed with small tasks and my hygiene and self care is decreased . Nothing is pleasurable. This is when my suicidal thoughts start to come in. I do the stuff I usually enjoy but it doesn’t feel the same. Like I’m not feeling anything. I’m bored of everything and everyone in this stage. I’m not talkative and stay to myself.
I can’t hold a job down and have constant changes of interests randomly.

And than out of nowhere a get a sense of boosted confidence realize and it feels like my life is going right. I start learning alot and trying new things . At first I thought it was genuine self exploration. This is however temporary and usually by this point I can catch myself and self reflect. Examples are becoming extremely religious out of nowhere even though I also return to my regular beliefs afterwards. It’s worse that I start planning and doing things that I’ll never  realistically do. I’m so interested in so many things and than I have  no interests in anything . I now by heart I’m pessimistic and an extreme realist  so when I start getting happy and optimistic I get scared because I know I’ll have to catch myself . There’s a difference In behavior when I’m happy versues  when I’m an episode. You can tell me I’ll die tomorrow and I wouldn’t care cuz life is amazing right now.

I feel more emotional during these stages and than it’s like I crash.I’m also paranoid and shaky in this phase My brain is constantly searching the room and I’m always looking around . It’s like something is watching me.I tend to stay up aswell alot. Like I went a day without sleep because I had so much energy. Everything feels so good Music, earth looks beautiful, etc. I start telling my family how much I love and care for them and even talking to old coworkers and stuff. I do not do this shit usually . I’m a very introverted person.

After this comes the crash. It’s worse than my usual depression. I get really anxious, suicidal , and agitated easily. This is typically in the past where i would cope with a substance to get back that amazing feeling . I’m clean now but in this stage I get a morbid curiosity of recreational drugs , Death, and criminal behavior.In this stage I crave adrenaline. I have got into physical altercations, I go extreme speeds in neighborhoods , I spend money and act impulsively. 50K in a short amount of time 
. I noticed this stuff when I started reflecting.
I can’t name how much time, energy, and effort that I feel wasted and after three years of the same cycle .

The worse thing is that I have a self defense mechanism from my childhood trauma and bullying that almost unwillingly makes me always say I’m fine. My Brain always seems to “resolve” the issue but in reality it’s me hiding from myself if that makes sense. I go to therapy and say I’m fine . The night before I was debating about killing myself. The week before I stayed in bed for a month rotting away. 

I’ve convinced alot of my therapists and wasted time because they always say the same thing and it’s because my brain won’t allow me to show emotion in fear of judgement . They always say I’m well dressed, mannered , and professional because they have only saw that side. It’s like manipulation at the point but my I’m the one being manipulated to tell them I’m ok. I really feel that something bad will happen to me. I used to get beat bad when I was a kid and I think this is where intern. I start saying I’m happy on the screenings and behavior test but if you compare them it’s never consistent how can you go from being extremely happy to extremely suicidal in a term of days. How can you go from being motivated to do stuff to rotting for months at a time?

As their friendship develops, Heidi realizes Len is depressed. Not only does Len barely eat, she oversleeps because she doesn't see the point in getting out of bed. Len also does very poorly academically and has a tendency to skip school. 

Heidi learns Len's older sister died when she was little and it caused her parents to divorce. Her mom became a distant workaholic who puts a lot of pressure on Len to get good grades, which sucks because Len struggles academically (haven't decided if this is due to a learning disability or not). She hardly sees her father, who tries to buy her love by sending money, and doesn't feel like her friends see her, as they never talk about negative feelings. Len's real motivation for approaching Heidi was because she thought they might know what it's like to feel alone.

,depression,"I’m not fully sure how to start this, but my mental state has been the worst it has ever been in my entire life. I recently turned 18 and for the past 2 or 3 months, my depression has ramped up to an unbearable extreme.

For context: I first had problems with my mental health in 2020, mostly issues with anxiety. I lost all of my friends in that period, but I now realize that they weren’t real true friends so it’s not a regrettable thing looking back. In 2023 I started my first job, at first it was hard since I was not exactly good at socializing. Fortunately, two of my now favourite people took a chance on me and changed my life. 

I was happy, but as time went on, I started revolving my life around them. I was (am) only happy when I could see them and miserable when I couldn’t. I was a fully online student in high school so they were the only people I spoke to. I never thought I would care about people again after all the times I got hurt/backstabbed, but I can honestly say I’d do anything for them. They are basically all I have, but since their circles are so much bigger than mine, I’m not as big of an impact. Since my circle is so warped and small, it creates a very obvious difference in the amount of free time we each have.
 
Anyway, in August of this year, one of my friends had to give up her work line since she was going to a university 2.5 hours away. I had known it was coming for a few months but nothing can prepare you for that gut punch when it actually happens. I went from seeing her all the time to not seeing her for 2 months. This is where my depression really got bad. I still had my one friend, but it’s in the air right now that he might be moving to a different country in the beginning of next year and that thought makes me sick (he doesn’t want to go either, parents decision).

I broke when my friend left. I value in person relationships so much now because texting is absolutely horrible. It’s like you’re talking to a different person. I couldn’t eat for two weeks after she left, I was only getting out of bed to go to work, and when I was at work, I was a mess. My other friend could barely keep me going. 

My friends are also pretty bad responders, it’s not their fault, but it’s really hard for me to not take it personally because I also have issues with diagnosed OCD and anxiety. In the beginning I was better at shrugging it off because I was in university myself (kept me busy-ish), but I unfortunately had to temporarily stop my studies due to my mental health and not knowing what career path I want to take. Now I’m spending all my time at home, in my thoughts, miserable.

My friend recently came back from uni for reading week; I got to see her for the first time in nearly two months. I didn’t tell her about my temporary dropout until I could see her in person because I was embarrassed and I didn’t know how to approach the subject. I felt like such a loser telling her, and while she was trying to be supportive and give me alternative ideas (general BA) I felt pretty crappy. She doesn’t really understand the effects of depression, so it was hard for her to see *why* I had to stop.

After she said goodbye for the second time, I felt worse than the first time. It was so hard. My other friend was with me when she left which helped, but I could tell he wasn’t okay either. He also struggles with depression but is less “clingy” than me with people. I don’t have anything to focus on (school) so my entire attention is based around them again. I feel like a total loser for not doing anything with my life while she is following through on her academic journey. I’m so crazy proud of her, while insanely disappointed in myself. 

I’m also constantly scared I’m going to lose them, and it’s so hard for me not to overdo it when it comes to texting them and such. I feel like I’m always screwing up since my social skills still aren’t up to par with what’s normal for my age. I constantly fuck up in stupid little ways that eat me up at night.

My friend that is still here knows what’s going on, he understands it because he used to have some of the same problems. I hate leaning on him because he’s not in a good mental place either (for very different reasons), so I try really hard to ride the wave alone as much as I can. 

Life feels impossible right now, I’m in the worst place of my life. I have no prospect for what I want to do in the future, my part time job is the only thing I have. I’m terrified of everyone I’ve met at work leaving to go on to better things while I’ll just be stuck there forever. I’m unable to even think of ideas of what interests me because nothing does right now. Therapy doesn’t help because I hold myself back (I hate crying in front of people) and I just feel like I’m drowning.

With my friend gone again, the same anxiety exists. I’m scared she’ll realize that I’m not a worthy friend and cut me off (that’s easy to do when you don’t see them all the time). I feel like I have to really think about texting her so I don’t bug her because I don’t want to potentially annoy her (even though she’s never said I do annoy her). I miss her already and it’s been 3 days, I don’t know what to do. I cry myself to sleep every night and barely do anything during the day.

,depression,"I'm just gonna let it all out here, I'm usually a very reserved person who doesn't do stuff like this; speaking out on my true feelings has always given me some sort of anxiety. I've barely even posted on reddit so I'm not even sure if I'm doing this right. But I really just need to vent and am so lost right now. This is probably gonna be really long and all over the place and I'm not expecting feedback from what I'm about to spew, but I just need to let it out. I am a 25 year old male.

I'll start off with some background and say that despite my mom, dad, and sister all being diagnosed with depression, I myself have never been diagnosed with it. I've never gotten an actual screening on my brain, but I've done online tests, those little doctor questionnaires, and everything indicates that I do not have it. I am very grateful and lucky to be in my position: my parents are still together, I get along with them very well and living with them feels like I have my own place since they're so chill with whatever I do. I'm healthy, I workout, I'm sociable and get along with people, I have a car, a job, and it's never a struggle to eat. I know how many people would kill to have these things, and I know there's people suffering from actual depression who have it way worse. I feel almost unworthy of posting in here. But unfortunately, it hasn't helped with the way I've been feeling lately.

As I've gotten older, my desire to do things that I enjoy have dwindled greatly. Things that used to bring me so much joy, make me feel nothing anymore. Almost everyday I wake up feeling sad, with nothing to look forward to or be excited about for the day. My mood affects the way I go about the day, and I can't just jump right into what I need to do and I never get as much done in a day as I want to. Almost every single thing feels like a chore. I'm 25 yet barely have any money saved.

I didn't go to college, I went to trade school to learn electrical only to find out it was something I absolutely hated. So I went back two years ago to try one of the few things I genuinely enjoy: art, graphics, multimedia, etc. But here I am now, over a year finished from that class and I'm currently working a dead end job with no future. I am not happy, I'm barely making money, and I cannot find work in my field. Since my career path is still undecided and my money is so low, anytime I'm not working towards something that would help it makes me extremely stressed. I'm sure this is a factor of me not being able to enjoy things I typically like. But then when the time comes to work on said things, my motivation is so low and i can't bring myself to do it. It feels like torture since I'm aware of all of these things mentally but my heart feels something completely different and doesn't allow me to do the things I want to. Even if I were to man up and try it anyway, my anxiety would increase and my focus would just not be there. It's like a never ending loop of hell.

So like, what am I gonna do? If it's something I'm not interested in or something that pays very well, I will be unable to put true effort into it or pursue it. I will be miserable. So many times I've tried to be stronger and not let this affect me, but one way or the other I will end up in the spot I am now. I have no clue what the next step is for me, and I've given up on doing this art/multimedia thing as a career. It's impossible to find work, even if I do it's not a guaranteed well paying career. So I've tried turning it into a side thing that could possibly be a passive stream of income, but even that I'm losing hope for. My art doesn't hold a candle to these artists I see online and I just don't know how I'd be able to focus and build something with all of this stress and anxiety inside of me.

And that's the thing with me; I don't want to spend all this time working towards something that isn't guaranteed. I used to think I could do it and the thought of being an entrepreneur and the whole process used to excite me; but now it's the opposite. It's way too stressful and every single day I will be in my head questioning what I am doing. If I were to snap my fingers now and have exactly what I'd want it would be this: a well paying job that I am content with (I've also given up on finding an occupation that I genuinely like, because I can barely think of any and even if I do, I don't have the experience or connections to get it), a job that I can leave at work when I clock out and not have to think about it when I'm done so I can just enjoy my free time stress-free. And lastly, which is a whole different spiel; a happy relationship.

I can go on and on about the dating scene right now, but I don't wanna go on another super long tangent. I'll just say that at this point I'd rather just pretend they don't exist. One of my biggest flaws, and I can't believe that I'm posting this publicly, is that my sex drive is insanely high. Being sexually attracted to someone is a big deal for me and if I'm not, it won't work. I truly hate this about myself and wish I could see past it but again, my heart doesn't allow me to. Every single girl I have been genuinely interested in have either lead me on, ghosted me, or straight up told me they are not interested unexpectedly. I have built up genuine trust issues because of these experiences. I've been crushed so many times, and I can't even say that I don't attract women because I do, just not ones I am attracted to. This makes me feel even worse, I hate hurting people and I feel like it invalidates my right to complain about this. But fuck man I just can't shake this feeling. This leads me to another torturous loop, because I will shut myself off from women and society to give myself peace. But then I get lonely or horny, one way or the other and I put myself back out there and the cycle repeats itself.

And one last thing that's not as major, but you know how some people just don't have the best luck? I feel like I fall into that category. The amount of times I've had bad luck happen to me compared to good luck is just insane. It's not even big things, but when so many little stupid instances of bad luck keep adding onto each other I can only handle so much, especially with everything else I've discussed affecting me. It truly feels like God is controlling everything in my life and is trying his best to make it as difficult as possible for me.

So really I just don't know what to do. I feel genuinely lost and at times worthless. I do not exceed tremendously at anything, I never stand out in a specific field or skill so I feel like my worth and value is so low. Like wtf do I do right now? I feel like the only option is re-inventing myself completely, but there's no way I can mentally do that on my own. I've been considering popping tons of acid to give myself ego death. I just can't take the constant stress and anxiety anymore. Like, what does it take nowadays to feel genuinely happy? Genuinely excited? Like that feeling I'd get when I was a kid? Just thinking about it makes me want to break down. Am I just being a giant pussy? I'm a man approaching his so called prime years and I feel like I should be stronger than this. But nothing is working and I feel so terrible.

There's still more I can go on about but I think that's it for now. If anyone actually spent the time reading all of that nonsense I appreciate you keeping your ears open. I'll keep trying to chug along hoping I stumble upon something that will make things better. Just writing all of this has helped me a little.

I&amp;#39;ve barely even posted on reddit so I&amp;#39;m not even sure if I&amp;#39;m doing this right. But I really just need to vent and am so lost right now. This is probably gonna be really long and all over the place and I&amp;#39;m not expecting feedback from what I&amp;#39;m about to spew, but I just need to let it out. I am a 25 year old male.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll start off with some background and say that despite my mom, dad, and sister all being diagnosed with depression, I myself have never been diagnosed with it. I&amp;#39;ve never gotten an actual screening on my brain, but I&amp;#39;ve done online tests, those little doctor questionnaires, and everything indicates that I do not have it. I am very grateful and lucky to be in my position: my parents are still together, I get along with them very well and living with them feels like I have my own place since they&amp;#39;re so chill with whatever I do. I&amp;#39;m healthy, I workout, I&amp;#39;m sociable and get along with people, I have a car, a job, and it&amp;#39;s never a struggle to eat. I know how many people would kill to have these things, and I know there&amp;#39;s people suffering from actual depression who have it way worse. I feel almost unworthy of posting in here. But unfortunately, it hasn&amp;#39;t helped with the way I&amp;#39;ve been feeling lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#39;ve gotten older, my desire to do things that I enjoy have dwindled greatly. Things that used to bring me so much joy, make me feel nothing anymore. Almost everyday I wake up feeling sad, with nothing to look forward to or be excited about for the day. My mood affects the way I go about the day, and I can&amp;#39;t just jump right into what I need to do and I never get as much done in a day as I want to. Almost every single thing feels like a chore. I&amp;#39;m 25 yet barely have any money saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t go to college, I went to trade school to learn electrical only to find out it was something I absolutely hated. So I went back two years ago to try one of the few things I genuinely enjoy: art, graphics, multimedia, etc. But here I am now, over a year finished from that class and I&amp;#39;m currently working a dead end job with no future. I am not happy, I&amp;#39;m barely making money, and I cannot find work in my field. Since my career path is still undecided and my money is so low, anytime I&amp;#39;m not working towards something that would help it makes me extremely stressed. I&amp;#39;m sure this is a factor of me not being able to enjoy things I typically like. But then when the time comes to work on said things, my motivation is so low and i can&amp;#39;t bring myself to do it. It feels like torture since I&amp;#39;m aware of all of these things mentally but my heart feels something completely different and doesn&amp;#39;t allow me to do the things I want to. Even if I were to man up and try it anyway, my anxiety would increase and my focus would just not be there. It&amp;#39;s like a never ending loop of hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So like, what am I gonna do? If it&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;m not interested in or something that pays very well, I will be unable to put true effort into it or pursue it. I will be miserable. So many times I&amp;#39;ve tried to be stronger and not let this affect me, but one way or the other I will end up in the spot I am now. I have no clue what the next step is for me, and I&amp;#39;ve given up on doing this art/multimedia thing as a career. It&amp;#39;s impossible to find work, even if I do it&amp;#39;s not a guaranteed well paying career. So I&amp;#39;ve tried turning it into a side thing that could possibly be a passive stream of income, but even that I&amp;#39;m losing hope for. My art doesn&amp;#39;t hold a candle to these artists I see online and I just don&amp;#39;t know how I&amp;#39;d be able to focus and build something with all of this stress and anxiety inside of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s the thing with me; I don&amp;#39;t want to spend all this time working towards something that isn&amp;#39;t guaranteed. I used to think I could do it and the thought of being an entrepreneur and the whole process used to excite me; but now it&amp;#39;s the opposite. It&amp;#39;s way too stressful and every single day I will be in my head questioning what I am doing. If I were to snap my fingers now and have exactly what I&amp;#39;d want it would be this: a well paying job that I am content with (I&amp;#39;ve also given up on finding an occupation that I genuinely like, because I can barely think of any and even if I do, I don&amp;#39;t have the experience or connections to get it), a job that I can leave at work when I clock out and not have to think about it when I&amp;#39;m done so I can just enjoy my free time stress-free. And lastly, which is a whole different spiel; a happy relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can go on and on about the dating scene right now, but I don&amp;#39;t wanna go on another super long tangent. I&amp;#39;ll just say that at this point I&amp;#39;d rather just pretend they don&amp;#39;t exist. One of my biggest flaws, and I can&amp;#39;t believe that I&amp;#39;m posting this publicly, is that my sex drive is insanely high. Being sexually attracted to someone is a big deal for me and if I&amp;#39;m not, it won&amp;#39;t work. I truly hate this about myself and wish I could see past it but again, my heart doesn&amp;#39;t allow me to. Every single girl I have been genuinely interested in have either lead me on, ghosted me, or straight up told me they are not interested unexpectedly. I have built up genuine trust issues because of these experiences. I&amp;#39;ve been crushed so many times, and I can&amp;#39;t even say that I don&amp;#39;t attract women because I do, just not ones I am attracted to. This makes me feel even worse, I hate hurting people and I feel like it invalidates my right to complain about this. But fuck man I just can&amp;#39;t shake this feeling.

,depression,"Am I wrong for thinking my mom wants me dead?

Hello, I'm 23 y/o, depressed, taking my pills the best I can. My mom knows I'm depressed, she's the only one in the family who knows. I asked her to keep it a secret because it embarrasses me and also, my family is extremely toxic.

My mom is a wrathful woman, she gets angry easily. Last night we had a small fight, as always, about something stupid. Then I asked her to go with me to the supermarket (yeah, I think I have a little agoraphobia too, I can't stand leaving my home alone)

The thing is, we were walking down the stairs and she was still mad with me and asked me to go first, and I don't know why but half joking I told her, ""No, I don't wanna go first, what if you pushed me?"" Then she glared at me like she was about to punch me and said ""if I wanted to push you down the stairs I would have so a long time ago""

Then I nervously laughed and began to go down the stairs with she behind me. Then before reaching the door she said. ""Besides, don't you want to be dead so bad?, why are you even scared of me then?""

I frozed. Like, yeah, why was afraid of she pushing me down if everything I want every day is to die? I honestly didn't remembered that at that moment. It was like an old half forgotten feeling. It made me think, ""Yeah, apparently I'm not actively trying to kill myself anymore...but why did you have to say that?""

And, it's not the first time she says things like that... she's always questioning me why do I look happy, why do I do this or that, why do I say things like I'm scared of dying if what I want is really to be dead.

(I tried a couple of times to ""unalive"" myself, all of them were unsuccessfully, a couple of days ago I would be thinking, ""good I didn't succeed on trying to take my own life"" but right now I'm sad I didn't succeed, and I'm disappointed on me for being such a coward.)

The first time I went to college was seven years ago. I went for the wrong reasons, just to escape my abusive family, and needless to say, my mental health suffered and I had to return home. 

Last January I decided to go back. Me and my family had made amends and I was doing better, going to therapy and taking my medications.

,depression,"Hello, 

I have had a few unsavory interactions with men. We will call them one, two and three.
One- drugged and raped by 2 men (4 years ago), two- domestic violence ended with his arrest (6 years ago), three- dated a guy for 3 months and he's afraid I'll out him wishing to be trans (3 years ago). 

I live in the same town as all of them; the same place all the situations occurred, and I am stuck here until I graduate from college.. at least.. in a year from now I pray. This is mostly without incident.. but I work at a store in town, and they know where I live, and what I drive. The police are very little help as most of every thing is heresay. I see a therapist. I obviously shouldn't have another boyfriend. And I can't afford a body guard. 

I need to leave town. I don't feel safe in a regular basis. I'm anxious to go to work and I dread the day one of them comes in. Sure, I haven't made the best choices in my life when it comes to men, but I'm not a bad person and I'm doing everything I can to get myself somewhere better. It doesn't seem like they care to forget me or leave me be. I don't go around talking crap or bothering them. I try to live as if they don't exist. I should have never given them the light of day, but I was insecure and younger then. Lost. But I'm smart, wised up and I've been single six years now. Anyways... I've told more than one person that if anything ever happened to me that it wasn't suicide. 
Allow this to be another spot I write my testament down. So that if anything does happen.. a record exists somewhere. 

It's come to my attention that two is still obsessed with me, posting on his Facebook about his unrequited love and sadness. His father goes around to the local bars and says I beat up his son. His father has stalked me. They both own guns. Two was mentally abusive, and then physically. He's an alcoholic, something I became with him, but recovered when I left him. I had a restraining order on him which has expired. It's not so easy to get those.. and it's not like putting up a bubble around me to keep them away.. 3 years ago I sold my car and got a new one so he couldn't shout at me and give me the finger. About 2 years ago I finally changed my phone number- I had blocked 20+ phone numbers he had tried to use to get in contact with me. If I end up in a ditch, or abducted. Look his way.

After I reported One to the local police, they demolished the side of the building that the assault occured in. Unfortunately I did not go to the police soon enough and no testing could be done. It had gone around town that those 2 had drugged other girls as well, but I couldn't convince any of them to report it. Nothing came of it. And I see them along my drive often. If I wind up dismembered.. start there.

Three was a disgusting pig, ""recovered addict,"" and confided a lot more to me than he should have after 3 months.. things that are not my style. It was maybe 3 months. More like 2 and then me trying to be nice for 1 and let him down easy. I broke it off and he was rather upset, tried to do a donut in my front yard but got stuck, and buried his tires. There's a lot to why he was a terrible person but I'm gonna keep it short. Just take my word for it, I did not want to mess with him. So I called the cops. They pulled him out after making him sweat it. A year ago I started a job in town and he came in to my work and harassed me, called me names, said he'd spit on me, stared at me. More than once. I reported it to the police, he found out, bitched my boss out, who then told me I could get in trouble for it. Fuck that. I quit. He drove by me the other day, with his gross middle finger up at me. I expect he will see my vehicle at my new place of work and come in to try to harass me again. When I'm found beat up and decapitated.. it was him.

,depression,"Ever feel like you're not quite where you want to be? It's a common sentiment among those striving for greatness – happily discontent can be a resourceful place to be.

It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are: we’re hardwired towards the negative. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.


Consider the indicators of those who make it:

•	You learn from setbacks. Rather than dwelling on just the mistakes, you arrive at a balanced view and modify – rather than abandon - your plans to learn and continue growing. You identify any patterns behind repeating the same errors. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviours. Responses from the past may have server well then, but perhaps not now. You can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes.

•	You’re clear on your purpose and priorities. Knowing what you want is the second key step to getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first.) Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life. Once you know what you want, prioritisation becomes easier. 

•	You understanding the difference between important and urgent. We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important. You align your actions with your chosen goals. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most important thing you could be doing right now. You avoid deluding yourself with merely being busy.  

•	You have made some progress already. Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

•	You’re not alone. There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others. Engaging with people who share your values and aspirations provides encouragement and perspective.

•	You’re committed. You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose, actions, and your environment align.

•	You consider other’s opinions. You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

•	You are grateful. You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

•	You’re authentic. You know your values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these. Grounded in your values and beliefs, you make decisions that reflect your true self. Your authenticity shines through in your actions, fostering trust and credibility.

When you have aligned your values, beliefs, purpose, actions, and environment you will doing better than most. This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

You align your actions with your chosen goals. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most important thing you could be doing right now. You avoid deluding yourself with merely being busy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You have made some progress already. Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You’re not alone. There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others. Engaging with people who share your values and aspirations provides encouragement and perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You’re committed. You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose, actions, and your environment align.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You consider other’s opinions. You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You are grateful. You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You’re authentic. You know your values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these. Grounded in your values and beliefs, you make decisions that reflect your true self. Your authenticity shines through in your actions, fostering trust and credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have aligned your values, beliefs, purpose, actions, and environment you will doing better than most. This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desire + Strategy + Persistence = Authentic Results&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"This may be a long one as I'm just trying to find a place to write it down.

I do think I may be going crazy thinking anyone would read this crap but I just can't sleep after today so...

  
I'm a single dad (36y/o) of 2 kids and both have been diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). My oldest is severely autistic to a point where he's basically trapped in his own mind and can't communicate other then repeating what he has heard. This can be a minute ago, an hour, even a year ago. My youngest is the most beautiful girl and literally my sole reason why I haven't put an end to my life yet. She does have the ability to communicate ""normally"" and can even have conversations with me.

  
This brings me to my point that I feel like life is no more then a prison. 

Reasons for not wanting in:

\- My ex spends almost no time with the kids (she has them from Sundayevening 19:00 until Thursdaymorning when they leave for school) as they are mostly in school. We made this arrangement as it was so we could both keep our jobs. For me, she has basically been hiding from our son the moment he was getting harder to deal with. This was before we separated and even more so after we separated. This also means she spends less time with her daughter. She also has 1 free weekend every 3. One would think she'd like to spend that weekend with her kids, but no. As a ""favor"" to me she picks them up sundayafternoon around 13:00 in that specific weekend.

\- I've tried looking for things to do for my son (organisations, babysitters, general help,...) but there's simply no room anywhere.

\- I do not have any father-daughtertime because my son basically steals all the attention.

\- I've recently had a mental break because of lack of rest due to taking care of the kids every day that I'm home.

\- I cannot take my kids to something that other parents do, like an amusementpark, movietheatre, restaurant,... Even the forest is too much for my son to handle as he quickly becomes extremely angry or sad if we don't leave soon.

\- During my mental break, I got a call from my job saying I'm terminated from it.

\- Due to life expectancy I will most likely end up burying my son as well after having taken care of him for his whole life.

  
Reasons why I can't get out:

\- If I'm not around anymore, my kids won't be taken care of and won't be getting the help they need

\- I need to make sure my daughter can have the life she has the potential to have because nobody else will

  
As you can see, there's plenty of reasons for me to not want to live anymore. I want this pain to end, I want this suffering to stop eating away at my mind and I just can't. Because of these 2 reasons. I see a happy family across the street and my blood starts boiling. I hear about a deadbeat dad not looking after 2 healthy kids and I want to punch them in the face. They have what I can't have and they don't even know how lucky they are. 

You always hear people say ""enjoy life, you only get one"". All I wanted in my life was my best friend (now my ex), a nice home (not too big) and 1 or 2 kids, grow old together and watch the kids grow and create their own life. There's nothing enjoyable about life when the one thing you wanted the most in the whole world becomes a corrupted, twisted version of it. It's literal torture to see my son being as he is, trapped in his own mind. I always compare it to him being on a island that you can see when you're walking by the coast. He's yelling, waving, doing anything possible to get your attention and you're just standing there not understanding a word he's saying.

But I can't get out of this torture because nobody else will look after him. 

Life feels like a prison because I want to get out so badly but I'm strapped into my chair with 2 chains and I'm watching myself suffer with all kinds of equipment, making me angrier and angrier. I do believe that once my anger has reached it's limit, the chains will break.

I went to school for music education, took a job, and quit it almost immediately—I hated every second of it. I struggled with depression throughout school, but mental health was never taken seriously when I was growing up.

My dad passed away at 50 and had severe bipolar II disorder. He would stay in his room for days, barely coming out.

Growing up, he never worked, and my mom covered all the bills, sometimes even selling my things for money. We had utilities shut off more than once—water, electricity, and gas. Needless to say, my childhood from ages 10 to 15 was chaotic. Fast forward to now.

Hi everyone,

I’ve been feeling so drained and alone lately, like I’m stuck in a cycle I can’t break. I don’t have any close friends, barely leave the house, and can’t seem to find joy in anything I used to enjoy. Most days, it feels like I’m just going through the motions, trying to keep it all together.

I recently tried talking to my mom about how I’ve been feeling, hoping she’d understand, but it didn’t go well. Instead of support, she got angry and canceled my gym membership. She thinks I’m being ungrateful, and it feels like she sees her problems as the only real ones. It’s like I don’t have anyone who’s willing to understand or just listen.

I’d thought about therapy, but my mom wouldn’t support that idea, so I feel stuck. I guess I’m here just looking for anyone who might relate or have advice on how to get through this. Any words would mean a lot. Thanks for reading.

,depression,"Online school is the worst thing that's ever happened to me, writing this in an online class btw.

My mother has signed me up for like 6 different classes. I hate attending them but both my parents insist i attend, I already have a normal school and I'm doing well in it.  
  
Now here comes the 2nd issue, my school is a learning center ( mini school which is a large 2 story villa ) so it makes sense that it has less people, I don't live in my country so that's why I go there, I have 5 girls in my class... I hate them so much and I just want friends to hangout with. I don't have boys in my class which annoys me so much.  
  
Now here comes the 3rd issue, I live in a bad city which has nothing in it with an average of 38C-44C temperature, the only mall is small and lacks fun places, no good places to have fun in, no festivals, no theme parks, it has 1 big park.

Which brings us to the 4th problem, Racism towards people from Egypt (me), Saudi Arabians mainly think they are better than us just cuz they have money, a proof of this is when my dad was standing next to our car making sure my little brother arrives to school ( he is 7 so it makes sense my dad is scared for him ) a woman who was standing next to our car, in a position where my dad is in front of her car decided she wouldn't wait for 10 secs and hits my dad ( thankfully didnt hit him hard or smth ) just a tap then she ran away, and another time a man (16-19 years of age I suppose ) surprised us and came from nowhere and blamed it on us, took a video of us, pictured our license plate by standing in the middle of the road ( he placed his car is the middle vertically)  
and speaking of Racism, there is a small football court in front of my house, you guessed it! everyone there hates me and my friends for being not Saudi Arabians, we even once got to a heated argument and had to fight sometimes ( I kicked one of them in his balls, proud of that btw ).

And now for the last problem, Friends, I need friends, all my friends are older than me 15-17 years of age which makes being able to go out hard since they also have stuff to do ( their school is somehow easier than mine )   
I am 13 and I'm in 9th class. My only friend in school is a 12 year old in 8th which still annoys me that I cant be with him most of the time. You always need that one person to be with and be yourself around, in class the girls have low ahh voices just cuz I'm there, so if you are a guy in a class of girls they will apparently be shy? even tho    
the girls in 7th (12-14 yr olds) sometimes spoke to me directly ( friendly joking way ofc ) and when we playing football and ball hits them they speak to us so its normal, it annoys me how much time they waste on being shy and not speaking most of the time, its like screen time in tv show, i get like 95% of it (no joke). My parents promised if there were no boys in class they would make me stay at home, guess what?   
since they are the ""parents"" they can always take back what they say.

I have been so sad recently specially yesterday after i realised all of this, just because some people decided it was fun to bully me on fortnite, my kindness made them stop and apologize ( i follow the rule ""no enemies"") , when they where being like that and saying i was bad and stuff that made me re think everything which led me to write this looking for a solution to my life problems.

&lt;p&gt;My mother has signed me up for like 6 different classes. I hate attending them but both my parents insist i attend, I already have a normal school and I&amp;#39;m doing well in it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here comes the 2nd issue, my school is a learning center ( mini school which is a large 2 story villa ) so it makes sense that it has less people, I don&amp;#39;t live in my country so that&amp;#39;s why I go there, I have 5 girls in my class... I hate them so much and I just want friends to hangout with. I don&amp;#39;t have boys in my class which annoys me so much.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here comes the 3rd issue, I live in a bad city which has nothing in it with an average of 38C-44C temperature, the only mall is small and lacks fun places, no good places to have fun in, no festivals, no theme parks, it has 1 big park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the 4th problem, Racism towards people from Egypt (me), Saudi Arabians mainly think they are better than us just cuz they have money, a proof of this is when my dad was standing next to our car making sure my little brother arrives to school ( he is 7 so it makes sense my dad is scared for him ) a woman who was standing next to our car, in a position where my dad is in front of her car decided she wouldn&amp;#39;t wait for 10 secs and hits my dad ( thankfully didnt hit him hard or smth ) just a tap then she ran away, and another time a man (16-19 years of age I suppose ) surprised us and came from nowhere and blamed it on us, took a video of us, pictured our license plate by standing in the middle of the road ( he placed his car is the middle vertically)&lt;br/&gt;
and speaking of Racism, there is a small football court in front of my house, you guessed it! everyone there hates me and my friends for being not Saudi Arabians, we even once got to a heated argument and had to fight sometimes ( I kicked one of them in his balls, proud of that btw ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now for the last problem, Friends, I need friends, all my friends are older than me 15-17 years of age which makes being able to go out hard since they also have stuff to do ( their school is somehow easier than mine )&lt;br/&gt;
I am 13 and I&amp;#39;m in 9th class. My only friend in school is a 12 year old in 8th which still annoys me that I cant be with him most of the time. You always need that one person to be with and be yourself around, in class the girls have low ahh voices just cuz I&amp;#39;m there, so if you are a guy in a class of girls they will apparently be shy? even tho&lt;br/&gt;
the girls in 7th (12-14 yr olds) sometimes spoke to me directly ( friendly joking way ofc ) and when we playing football and ball hits them they speak to us so its normal, it annoys me how much time they waste on being shy and not speaking most of the time, its like screen time in tv show, i get like 95% of it (no joke). My parents promised if there were no boys in class they would make me stay at home, guess what?&lt;br/&gt;
since they are the &amp;quot;parents&amp;quot; they can always take back what they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been so sad recently specially yesterday after i realised all of this, just because some people decided it was fun to bully me on fortnite, my kindness made them stop and apologize ( i follow the rule &amp;quot;no enemies&amp;quot;) , when they where being like that and saying i was bad and stuff that made me re think everything which led me to write this looking for a solution to my life problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thank you if you read all of this, i hope you have a great day. &lt;/p&gt;

I’ve tried medication as much as my gp has allowed; fluoxetine, trazodone, duloxetine with quetiapine and now stuck on venlafaxine not helping at all and making me gain weight (big problem, see below) but its been far far past the time it should start by and no change, they wont plan any further without cmht (but rejected referral) and i cant even get an appointment to say we need to stop asap before the weight gain lands me dead or seriously injured through self harm.

The CMHT reject any involvement and wont take me on, or advise GP.

Psychology will not even place me on their wait list (&gt;1 year long) because i am “too unstable” despite enduring for longer than a year managing to scrape by barely worse and only a few attempts, with no help or working treatment

I was kicked out of eating disorder services because i couldnt manage to eat more - they said they wouldnt help me with anything and i just had to eat more, gain weight and theyd somehow catch the fallout. They said they will not take me back on or try to help

I cant be honest about my mental state because they would rather section me than try any treatments to get better and not be at risk or needing help anymore. It would take away any chance of surgery and remove anything to live for. So this means i cant safely ask for help. 

Coping skills and crisis services arent helping at all, because i need ways to want to live, and life to be worth living before distress tolerance and any of that have a chance of helping. My problem isnt impulsivity or bad patterns, its that what should be ok and good is unendurable hell and no reason to stick around anyway.

I dont think there is anything left to try here, we have no crisis team, no other mental health services that arent the cmht/psychology and my gp keeps me on meds that arent helping and actively if slowly negative, refusing even when im not on anything to try even the normal common medication.

Please, is there something i can beg to ask to do or try? Im supposed to even endure to the date i chose to end, to try as long as i can, but im worried i cant make it to my own exit day.

Maybe only 20 minutes, sometimes an hour. I still sleep a solid 6.5-7 every night, but I am just exhausted. Every day. I feel like the weight of the world is sitting on top of my eyelids. Am I depressed? If so it must be functionally depressed, but why? If not, what&amp;#39;s wrong with me? I&amp;#39;ve been avoiding certain outings because I just don&amp;#39;t feel like putting in the effort. In my head I tell myself they&amp;#39;re things I enjoy, but they take so much energy. Being in crowds has never been my favorite, but even going to my son&amp;#39;s biggest marching band experience of the season is daunting just to think about. I&amp;#39;ve done blood tests and they appear normal. I&amp;#39;m not sure what the next step is.&lt;/p&gt;

I feel so alone despite constantly being around my bestfriend and my fiance. Its like i feel but i also feeel nothing at all. Worst part is i feel like a pussy for why i'm depressed. I know why I feel like this. I have adhd, autism, and pmdd. Im about to have my period and ive been feeling crampy and esp low. My other ""friend"" invited me and my fiance to a halloween party at her bfs house. I was so excited as i was mercilessly bullied in school. I was never invited to anything and I've never gone to a halloween party. I rushed and got us costumes i spent like $180. Me and this friend and my bestfriend go out for a girls night and drink a lil. this friend tries to hang out the following day, but sundays are my deepclean and grocery day so i said i really can't just drive you guys around. I spent like $80 last night on food and drinks and my bestfriend and I have an agreement we dont hang out sundays and mondays because her bf doesn't work and i do chores and get things done for the week. My bestfriend understands this so she asks ""do you really even wanna go?"" i said no and shes like ""ill tell her you have a personal thing so she doesn't ask again. She just told me shes coming over at 11am to my house so i cant get out of it"" my bestie is a people pleaser so shes not gonna say no. I was tired and drunk and i went to bed. Next day this ""friend"" calls and tells us there wont be a party anymore. And today shes out at a house party in the costume and all that. Today i also started my period so im already like half dissociated to the point im questioning my reality. (every month on the dot :/) so im already just like ""why does no one like me? I knew she never wanted me there. Im so fucking worthless and gone i cant even see when people are fucking with my feelings anymore."" So i got drunk with my bestie today. Ill probably get drunk tomorrow and the next day crying and trying not to hurt myself as i feel an overwhelming urge to do that.

I feel unlovable despite being engaged to the most wonderful man. We get married in 5 months... So why do i wanna die so bad? I feel so alone despite constantly being around my bestfriend and my fiance. Its like i feel but i also feeel nothing at all. Worst part is i feel like a pussy for why i&amp;#39;m depressed. I know why I feel like this. I have adhd, autism, and pmdd. Im about to have my period and ive been feeling crampy and esp low. My other &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; invited me and my fiance to a halloween party at her bfs house. I was so excited as i was mercilessly bullied in school. I was never invited to anything and I&amp;#39;ve never gone to a halloween party. I rushed and got us costumes i spent like $180. Me and this friend and my bestfriend go out for a girls night and drink a lil. this friend tries to hang out the following day, but sundays are my deepclean and grocery day so i said i really can&amp;#39;t just drive you guys around. I spent like $80 last night on food and drinks and my bestfriend and I have an agreement we dont hang out sundays and mondays because her bf doesn&amp;#39;t work and i do chores and get things done for the week. My bestfriend understands this so she asks &amp;quot;do you really even wanna go?&amp;quot; i said no and shes like &amp;quot;ill tell her you have a personal thing so she doesn&amp;#39;t ask again. She just told me shes coming over at 11am to my house so i cant get out of it&amp;quot; my bestie is a people pleaser so shes not gonna say no. I was tired and drunk and i went to bed. Next day this &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; calls and tells us there wont be a party anymore. And today shes out at a house party in the costume and all that. Today i also started my period so im already like half dissociated to the point im questioning my reality. (every month on the dot :/) so im already just like &amp;quot;why does no one like me? I knew she never wanted me there. Im so fucking worthless and gone i cant even see when people are fucking with my feelings anymore.&amp;quot; So i got drunk with my bestie today. Ill probably get drunk tomorrow and the next day crying and trying not to hurt myself as i feel an overwhelming urge to do that. Im just so disappointed in myself that i thought people liked me enough to really want me somewhere. And now im so numb im wondering why i cant feel love. Why I dont feel lust for my fiance much anymore. I just feel so worthless and like a piece of shit that deserves to rot. Thanks for listening ✌🏾&lt;/p&gt;

It sucked, but I thought it might be burnout - going and going for years and having a break paired with an already-stressful event was the straw that broke the camel&amp;#39;s back.&lt;br/&gt;
But it hasn&amp;#39;t stopped. I&amp;#39;m bitter, angry, stressed, and tired. I have no motivation and the simplest tasks like brushing my teeth, cleaning, or showering feel like mountains. I&amp;#39;m absolutely disgusted by what I look like and can&amp;#39;t stand to see current pictures while being envious of old ones. Everything has been a rockslide since earlier this year. It&amp;#39;s a stark difference from how I usually act - so much slower and more tired. Is this what depression feels like?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a 27-year-old guy. Wasn't short on looks, charisma and all that. But for the past 2 years, after I moved away from the war, my life has been sliding lower and lower.



I've lost some of my capital that I earned by creating projects on my own, which I've done all my life. 



3 of my businesses closed in three days, even though none of them were related and all of them were accidents (I think God is mocking me).



I started exploring a new niche, and in a year, even though I was doing everything right, taking regular consultations, double-checking everything - I didn't make a single dollar of profit. Every time I get close to something and get excited “This is it”, God pulls me back harder and harder. I've been spending about 10-15 hours a day at work for a year, but it's not working.



I've tried regulating my thoughts by working on my hormone levels, but it hasn't worked. I've always been fit, but I've gained fat and now I've also lost muscle - the shittiest combo ever. 



I've tried working with psychologists and different offshoots - it all turned out to be unworkable crap. I spent a lot of money on it.



I tried praying, studying religion, but none of that helped. 

  
I haven't celebrated Christmas or birthday in the last 2 years because I don't have much money. I didn't buy clothes, although for two more years my capital was 200.000+ earned by honest labor. 



I want to see the world, but I can't even make $1,000. 



I have no friends left, I don't even turn on the do not disturb mode on my phone because no one talks to me anymore.



I hardly ever leave the house because I can't afford to spend money without earning it after losing 70% of my capital. 



I've contacted help lines for these thoughts, but it doesn't help.



And I have often thought about suicide because every day I feel like God is just laughing at me. I have reassured myself that these thoughts are just a cry for the inner pain I am going through and the lack of answers.



But today, when I just sobbed for 6 hours straight, and then laid down for 5 hours with my heart aching from panic attacks...I realized I'm done. 



I honestly started looking at my prescribed 3 packs of antibiotics (which I got while I was getting dental work and got an infection), and I plan to drink them all at once.

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t celebrated Christmas or birthday in the last 2 years because I don&amp;#39;t have much money. I didn&amp;#39;t buy clothes, although for two more years my capital was 200.000+ earned by honest labor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to see the world, but I can&amp;#39;t even make $1,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no friends left, I don&amp;#39;t even turn on the do not disturb mode on my phone because no one talks to me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hardly ever leave the house because I can&amp;#39;t afford to spend money without earning it after losing 70% of my capital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve contacted help lines for these thoughts, but it doesn&amp;#39;t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have often thought about suicide because every day I feel like God is just laughing at me. I have reassured myself that these thoughts are just a cry for the inner pain I am going through and the lack of answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today, when I just sobbed for 6 hours straight, and then laid down for 5 hours with my heart aching from panic attacks...I realized I&amp;#39;m done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly started looking at my prescribed 3 packs of antibiotics (which I got while I was getting dental work and got an infection), and I plan to drink them all at once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sick of fighting it. I don&amp;#39;t have the energy. I&amp;#39;ve done everything I can, but I feel like God hates me and wants me to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m gonna do it.&lt;/p&gt;

She herself fell into a depression, and has been mentally incapable of dealing with being around our kids too much. She was physically and mentally unwell when her mom died, and we moved into her house from living in motels.   
Along with the house came her mentally challenged adult sister, and a job for my wife taking care of her full time. This helped out a lot, because my kids really only had me to take care of them anymore, I couldnt work.  I became full time dad, getting the boys from her room every time they would be a bother to her, cleaning the house, doing all the physical work, etc. Over time, I trusted her less and less around my boys alone. She just wasn't acting like someone who loves them and wants them around. We separated rooms, now I live in the living room with the boys, and she in her moms old room.  
This felt and still feels like a meaningful contribution to the home. But more and more I get told by her the real value is with financial contribution, and I am broke with no savings left. I got a job as a political surveyor where I could choose blocks to work when available and when I want. Despite this, I have had to cancel shifts because she couldnt handle the boys for too long. As a result it makes very little and whatever it does make has to go to the family, and is considered nothing and called not a real job. Im getting treated like I do nothing while being expected to do everything, and I do do everything. Everything 1 human can.   
I have been beaten, I have been devalued, I have tried to call cops and tell the truth, to nobody believing me. I ended up in jail because I was yelling, and nobody cared that she was too nor that I was being hit. Nobody is here to support what I say as true, I have no friends anymore either I can call and vent to. This is her home, and I have no way to escape it. No savings, no babysitter, no nothing. If I did try to take my kids to a shelter with me, she would get them without me as Im broke and cant get into a house; and my kids being here without me terrifies me.   
I love my boys more than the world, they are my everything, I want to take care of them and keep them safe, raise them and stand in the way of what could hurt them. I could leave on my own, but then Id have to give up on my entire world and hope to god someone believed me, that theyd be ok for a long time without me, that they wouldnt be taught to hate me.

It means nothing to these people, Im hated and alone except my boys. But they just dont understand whats going on, nor should they be expected to. Theyre autistic and just babies.  
Idk what to do, Im so utterly broken and defeated. Idek why I write this because its going to mean nothing materially, I just have nobody else to say it to.

Is this a question of when and not if? I can resist all I&amp;#39;d like now, but when I&amp;#39;m old, weak and afraid with no energy and will power left, I&amp;#39;ll do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once perceived depression as a parasite. Now, it&amp;#39;s strong rushing winds that will one day become a violent hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"So, i dont know where i can vent my situation semi anonymously. I have been battling with difficult depression my whole life. Last year it went to couple failed attempts but the closest one when i woke up did give me some sort of will to live.

Anyway, i was in the hospital and i met this woman she wasnt in there for long time but we bonded fast. We started to meet when we could. I had developed massive feelings for this woman. I stopped our connection completely for a long time. 

Well i recentlyish contacted her because i was thinking maybe i can get over my feelings. (I got a cat and wanted to show her him) she then told me she also got a cat. So we talked and she asked if i want to go see the cat and so i did go see the cat and her. After a while i had left she sent me messages that her crush on me is over the moon everytime we see. My feelings started to awake and i told her about how i feel about her too.

We planned a date and essentially became a couple right away. She wanted it to be serious fast because of the feelings we have for each other which we both had strong feelings we havent had with anyone before. So i as stupid as i am went with it and we got more serious. 

Well yesterday she went to therapy and the therapist for whatever reason told her that she should not get into a relationship like tht and told we should take a longer break. Which i cant agree on because (i do not think breaks work pretty ever. And i cant live with the uncertainty and how her health is).  I called the relationship over at this point because she trusts her therapist so much she wont budge. 

Well my depression and my suicidal tendencies have grown so much that im in a psychiatric hospital again. 

I dont know if i will be able to push through this and if i can. I dont think i can ever trust anyone anymore to give my love and affection. I got happyness that ive never felt i felt loved and understood that iv never felt. I felt safe. Well not anymore. Im dumb i know but… yeah.

Ever since last year all my friends started distancing themselves from me for some reason. I live a bit far away from everyone in my city, i need 6 bus tickets which cost a lot or walk for an hour straight just to get there. But I didn't care because they were my friends so if they wanted to hang out, of course I would go and be there, anything for them yk. But it started changing during the summer. They started making plans without including me, they stopped asking me if i wanna go out and have fun with them, they stopped talking to me, everything. I even gave them the idea before schools closed to go us 10 to a nearby island for 5 days, staying at a hotel. They all said they weren't that much of travelers. Yet there they were, uploading stories and posts about how amazing the trip is which i wasn't included, wasn't invited, wasn't told about. after that i started seeing them posting stories of all them going out when i asked beforehand if they'd go out and they said no. At school they stopped talking to me as well. They don't seem to want to talk to me whenever i try talking to them. They even requested to change classes ""without a reason"" when i mentioned how i wanted to sit close to them because they're my friends! And now they're changing schools too. Im just lonely. I can't keep doing this anymore. I can't keep pretending everything is alright. All summer i was ""out"". Or that's what my parents believed at least. From june to now, I've been going out on my own, just walking around the city, watching reels or tiktoks till my battery dies so my parents don't think im lonely and no one likes me. I've had a long history of being lonely. I was always the fat kid being bullied about his weight, his second hand clothes because my parents are poor and i never asked for expensive things etc. i reached a point of seeing my parents cry together late at night, not knowing what to do with me, feeling unable to help, as it was expected anyway, what could parents do for their kid who no one likes, they can't force people to be his friends. I never want to see my parents that way. Kept changing schools to see if i fit anywhere. Went to the gym and quite literally died there mentally and physically, got sent to the hospital many times for muscle tears and problems till i got to a shape i was somewhat comfortable with knowing damn well I'll never be comfortable enough, read many books on how to socialise and be liked more. But i guess fate isn't always on my side since all that went for nothing. That's one part of my problem. The second is with my girlfriend too. She's getting distant and getting mad over everything. We barely talk anymore and the ""talking"" is basically her being random to the point i don't understand her or her references or her being sarcastic until i say goodnight. Even the i love you feels fake and pointless anymore. She keeps talking to me about the guys in her school which we used to make fun of, now being like close friends to her and everything. Even mentioning people i never knew that she knew and she talks about them like they're better than me. I can't stop thinking im just someone to mess with for her, for them, for all. I can't keep living like this. I see my brother having the life i always dreamt of and can never achieve. He's so social, so open, so perfect, so liked by people. He has many friends which i know, good kids, i love them honestly. He's good at talking with people, he's good with socialising with literally everyone, he never had problems with anyone, he always was the perfect kid. And im just here pretending im better than him so he can look at me and say ""one day I'll be like you, you're perfect, thank you for being my brother and showing me what a real life should look like"". If only he knew it's a fake life created just to fool him and my parents so they don't realise how fucked up i am. How much pain i have to endure, how lonely I am. I just want to disappear.

,depression,"im sorry for my grammar mistakes cause I'm not that good in english but I've been feeling suicidal for years. I was born and raised in Singapore but I moved to another country 8 years ago. Growing up in that country is so hard cause I always get bullied a lot. They were shouting at me asking me to go back to my country. When I got back home and told my parents about it, they just asked me to endure it for another 3 years and that's how ny depression started. I always get compared to my sister a lot. She have a really sharp features with beautiful high bridge nose while I'm here looking all flat and my nose is so big. I'm so fat compared to her. My cousins would always treat me differently than her. They always see me as the invisible one. All the time. It feels like i'm not there. My brother is a drug addict. He is always there to make my parents sad. Always. He started getting influenced by his friends and started stealing my uncle's stuffs including his rolex watch. And that became a hot topic in the family. Everyone were talking shit bout my family and my parents got too sad and they kinda blame themselves for it. It genuinely makes me sad seeing them crying. We tried to do everything for my brother but he didnt even want to help himself. I'm so sad. I have severe anxiety attacks and I'm an overthinker but no one could understand my pain cause they've never been there before. 10 months ago, I lost my dad. He died. and I thought my brother would change but he never did. He disappoint us again and again. I hate seeing my mom cry. I'm 24. I want to find a job but i cant cause my mom is asking me to be with her 24/7. I'm the only one she could depend on.

I was born and raised in Singapore but I moved to another country 8 years ago. Growing up in that country is so hard cause I always get bullied a lot. They were shouting at me asking me to go back to my country. When I got back home and told my parents about it, they just asked me to endure it for another 3 years and that&amp;#39;s how ny depression started. I always get compared to my sister a lot. She have a really sharp features with beautiful high bridge nose while I&amp;#39;m here looking all flat and my nose is so big. I&amp;#39;m so fat compared to her. My cousins would always treat me differently than her. They always see me as the invisible one. All the time. It feels like i&amp;#39;m not there. My brother is a drug addict. He is always there to make my parents sad. Always. He started getting influenced by his friends and started stealing my uncle&amp;#39;s stuffs including his rolex watch. And that became a hot topic in the family. Everyone were talking shit bout my family and my parents got too sad and they kinda blame themselves for it. It genuinely makes me sad seeing them crying. We tried to do everything for my brother but he didnt even want to help himself. I&amp;#39;m so sad. I have severe anxiety attacks and I&amp;#39;m an overthinker but no one could understand my pain cause they&amp;#39;ve never been there before. 10 months ago, I lost my dad. He died. and I thought my brother would change but he never did. He disappoint us again and again. I hate seeing my mom cry. I&amp;#39;m 24. I want to find a job but i cant cause my mom is asking me to be with her 24/7. I&amp;#39;m the only one she could depend on. My sister is working in abu dhabi and seeing her having a great job makes me insecure cause look at me? I can&amp;#39;t even find a decent job. I feel like i have no future ahead of me.

,depression,"Just a little background information first, and then I'll lay out what I feel are my problems so you guys can give me some suggestions. I'm a 26-year-old man, I'm going to be 27 in a couple of months. I have a fiancé (27) and I have a child who's going to be 2 soon. I own my house with no mortgage, thank God because that's about the only thing keeping us afloat is not having to pay rent or a mortgage. The house was left to me when my father passed away when I was 16. I have been working in retail for the past 3 years, prior to that I sold drugs. I make about 35 to 40K after taxes, I will have to see as this will be my first year at this job. 

A little under a year ago, I switched jobs from making $15.50 hourly to $18 hourly and went from being a supervisor of a department at my previous job to being an assistant manager of the store at my current job. About six months prior to that, I had also acquired a certification in construction through a trade program at my local college. One last thing to add for references, I don't have my license at the moment. I've literally taken all the steps to get it. I just need to go to the DMV, take the test, and pass it to have my license. The only reason I haven't is because my vehicle won't pass the inspection and I don't have anyone to borrow a car from. 

As for my problem with direction in life and needing help finding a path, I know I need to get my license first, obviously. I'm scared to switch careers. I want to get into a trade eventually and maybe take an apprenticeship or at least use my construction certification to get my foot in the door and switch careers because I need to start a career. I have no savings. I live paycheck to paycheck and I need to do better for my family. My house is falling apart, and even paying house taxes every year is a scramble to save and we barely make it. I feel like my problem is mainly mental health. Lately, I feel like I'm a loser. I keep dwelling on the past, my past mistakes, regrets, and decisions, and I feel like it's too late in life for me to turn things around and make a better life for myself and my family. I feel like I'm letting them all down and that I am a failure in life. The bills are paid and there's food in the fridge, so I know I'm not doing that bad. But if I keep living this way and I don't make any changes, it's not sustainable for the future and I won't be able to provide the kind of life that I want for my family. The icing on the cake is I was recently diagnosed with a heart problem that I am on medication for. Hopefully, the medication takes care of it. Otherwise, I will need heart surgery and I have no insurance. The condition comes from a Covid infection that inflamed my heart, but I know I am not making things any better with the constant stress, anxiety, and panic attacks.

I've also been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I feel like I've been in survival mode for the past two years, having had a kid and needing to get my life in order. I was making good progress, but I got comfortable or just complacent. I was a high school dropout who was selling drugs, basically had nothing going for him, but my beautiful fiancé and the house that I was blessed with. With the baby on the way, I had to turn things around. But like I said, I feel like I've been in survival mode and I'm just now coming out of it, realizing I still need to do better. I have a lot of growing and a long way to go still. I just feel like I'm on the precipice of making a big change in my life, and it is freaking me out. For lack of a better term, it's like I know what I need to do and what I have to do in order to get myself out of this situation, but I am frozen with fear and stalling because I'm scared for what the future holds. My fiancé has been my rock, and her and our son are the only things that keep me going every day. At this point, the thing that snapped me out of my complacency and survival mode was that my fiancé was pregnant again. We were both excited for another baby until we snapped out of it and thought about finances, deciding the best thing to do would be to have an abortion. It wrecked us both emotionally and led me down the spiral of self-hate, which, together with the panic attacks, depression, and heart condition, have basically made me useless.

,depression,"I’m 25F.

Lately I’ve been a mess, but most people haven’t really noticed how bad my mental health is, only my best friends and therapist know how messed up I am right now.
I’m failing my college classes, I can’t seem to be able to do the projects I get assigned, not because I don’t know how to or want to but because I physically cannot get to do them.

I work full time and go to college, I’ve been doing this for almost 4 years now and I’m only halfway through the bachelors degree. I was managing a good balance, I was doing great at college and because I have a scholarship I’ve always been pressured to have good grades, but that has changed in the last few months.

Once I get home from work I shut off, I get extremely tired and I have to sleep. Or I get stuck to the couch and can’t do anything.

I feel horrible for being like this, oddly enough I’m incredible at work and I feel like that’s my safe space right now which isn’t good.

I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety since I was very young, I’ve always been good at masking and been going to therapy, but I think I’m just tired at this point. I have never taken a quarter off college, never, mostly because of my scholarship (and my ego I guess, because if I do I feel like a loser).

My therapist has referred me to a doctor to check if this could also be a physical health issue, like bad diet or something, but I know this is a long term issue.

I have my High School Diploma. I was in college but at this moment, I can’t afford books so I took a semester break. I moved in with my mom, of course it’s been very difficult for me trying to adjust to staying with people once again but her sorry excuse for a husband now put us in a predicament to get us evicted from here because he took money from her and didn’t pay the bills with it. On top of that, he keeps getting fired from all of the jobs that he has worked because he can’t stop stealing their SHIT! On top of sleeping on the job, knowing damn well he shouldn’t be doing that. He felt that since he knows that I am a hard worker, that he didn’t have to pay any bills (even though I lost my job) my main reason for coming here is because I couldn’t afford to pay as much money for bills. I’ve lost my car, I’ve lost everything. There was a blow up the other day and instead of him being the 65+ old man that could pay bills, when we were the ones to fill out his Social Security Application for him.

They have a favorite child that they do for and also favorite grandkids. I know it’s not their responsibility to take care of us, we are grown. But they always look to us for assistance when we are doing good but the time that everything starts getting tough, they never reciprocate the energy. Which is why I’ve always been big on having a job and keeping a job, having my own place and having a car, because I knew that if I lost it or ended up in this situation there would be ZERO help from them. Everything has literally turned into shit. I’ve tried with unemployment but in Florida, Unemployment is terrible right now. I read your posts and that’s the only thing that is keeping me optimistic is because I know I’m not the only one going through it. However, it’s super tough to stay positive going through this situation. I’ve cried myself to bed each night and wake up each morning with the same amount of tears.

I feel like my whole life is falling apart although it was never really together to begin with. I just graduated university in May and my mom ruined my graduation by trying to fight me in Walmart unprovoked. I said things in the heat of the moment that I regret as I’ve never spoken to my mother like that but trying to have the woman who birthed you run into you at Walmart and call you out of your name will do that to people. 

Two months after the fact I find out she’s dead from Facebook. My siblings had a whole funeral and nobody tried to reach out to me. Nobody knows how she died and my siblings are all being weird about inheritance when I just want to know what happened to my mom. 

The only good women friends I have are all moving out of Buffalo. 

I’m an entrepreneur and I quit my job after falling into a deep depression after the situation with my mom (which is my fault). And while my business has helped me pay the bills that’s all it does. I’m falling behind in my craft and I’m getting discouraged.

,depression,"Hi all, I'm just going to rant as I've been feeling extremely low for the past few days. 

Basically, had my first major depressive episode that lasted for 3 months when I was 15. Ever since then, Ive been depressed which is more than 10 years now. There were some periods that would last 1-3 months of me feeling okay, only to get back to being depressed. 

Last year I met someone whose presence made me feel alive, but I broke up with him pretty soon as it seemed like he lost interest. Ever since, I can't stop thinking about him, gained more than 15kg and been feeling horrible. 

This year I've decided to do something about my life and started eating healthy, got the job of my dreams and changed my lifestyle all together but as soon as I get back on track, I swear, in the next 2 weeks something horrible happens that's next to impossible and I go back to being devastated. 

I've been depressed, done my best to rise from it, something horrible happens, and so the cycle continues. 

I don't think I have it in me to start everything again from the scratch. In the past 6 years I've done some incredible things that I thought were next to impossible, yet they always slip through my hands immediately as I get them - like I said, within few weeks.

I don't know what else to do, and honestly, I don't think I have it in me anymore and what's worse is that I don't even see the point od trying again as all of my great efforts were for nothing.

nothing good is happening in my life as much as i try and struggle, i do stuff that i love and for a fleeting moment i forget that i am all alone and nobody wants me but the very second that i stop doing something all this self hatred and loneliness rushes back in like a small dam bursting after trying to hold back the biggest flood.

I just want to be understood, to have some one to talk to, who really cares about all this stuff, a hug, i fell like i am pretending to be happy for the people who are around me because my whole life the moment i told some one how i fell they leave or start hating me, i don't know what i did so wrong??? They wanted to know what is wrong with me, they insisted to open up and tell them how i really feel and the moment i let lose of the so called darkness i have in me people leave… why? Why? Why do they do this to me? It feels like they want to hurt me on purpose, if they just want to hurt me why? what did i ever do to them? I just want to die.

Maybe it doesn't make sense what i just said,but i feel i need to tell some one all of this.

I have improved my emotional intelligence over the years but it also feels like every year Im thinking ""this is the lowest Ive ever been"". It's hard bc those moments where Im truly happy, those make me feel like I do want to live, but the darkness between those moments cancels it out. 

My self care is so bad, I barely brush my teeth and bathe properly. I eat fast food constantly. Broke as shit and owe ppl money. I barely talk to people. Textbook depressed things ig.

My main sources of happiness are my little brother and little sister. I love them so fucking much. I have never dated or fallen in love and probably never will but the closest I will ever get is probably the love for my siblings. Idc about myself anymore. I just want them to be happy and not grow up to be like me. I want to be a good role model but they know I'm depressed and I dont want them to think they have to be as well. Ik my sister is depressed, and I really want to get better to inspire her...but its so hard my god.

I dont want to be alive, but I could never bring them the horrors of losing a loved one to self-exiting. So I get up everyday, miserable asf, keep myself somewhat alive, and try to stay alive for them. 

Oh man, Im so sorry to those who can relate, but living for the sake of other people is genuinely so fucking depressing like it makes me feel like the biggest piece of shit and I feel like Im always on the verge of going insane. (If you can relate, ur not a piece of shit I just hate myself lol)

The thought of living the rest of my life like this brings me such extreme sadness. But still, who knows, maybe one day I will actually live for myself. Just sure hope it doesnt happen after I've wasted my youth.

,depression,"This is a long post you've been warned


I've had depression, anxiety, low self esteem, and possibly BPD or something for as long as I can remember. But over the past 2 years, my trust in people, and my ability to regulate and practice mindfulness, and find some joy has pretty much disappeared.


My boyfriend watched this happen since our relationship began 2 years ago, and he wants his girlfriend back, but I don't recognize her anymore. I feel like this is me now, just a miserable, cranky, aggressive, frustrated, mean, toxic person who doesn't trust anyone, has no hope, and just wants to be entirely alone. I'm always uptight about a million things all at once. I used to be very goofy, and I loved making people laugh and smile. But when I was more happy and silly, people thought I was dumb and didn't take me seriously. I guess being angry people take you seriously but nobody wants to be around you


I used to listen to music in the car every time without fail; now, I generally just drive without music. I rarely do hobbies, and things that I used to love now don't really hit the same. I had faith in the universe/spirituality and people, but then my cat died of cancer in 2021 and I realized how the universe doesn't care who it kills or how, and that there are probably intelligent people who have a cure for cancer but choose to keep people/animals sick


I also lost a close friend because my own sensitivity and lack of trust in people. I just assumed something she said a year ago was a dig at me (it was admittedly rude), but instead of talking about it, I let it fester and pulled away. She pulled away too, and when she wanted to hang out finally, I decided to tell her I didn't think we should be friends. Neither of us communicated really, and I definitely didn't go about it in a healthy way. But we had similar interests, and I really enjoyed life when we hung out bc we were doing things that brought joy


On top of that, I've been getting very worked up at peoples' meanness towards each other &amp; politics. I probably sound like a nutcase when I spend hours scrolling and commenting and on things people say and do. It's like I'm watching myself from a distance, but this wasn't always me, or at least never this bad


I don't know if I can ever go back to the somewhat happier, fun, silly girl with lots of love and hope and trust in others and the universe. Even therapy doesn't work now because I don't trust that my own therapists like me; I don't trust that medications help because I've seen how shitty the side effects are and how they permanently alter our brains.


I just don't know how people can be happy, like what is there to be happy about? Is it safe to be happy when there is so much cruelty all around us? Isn't that selfish?

Im just thankful I did not just quit with no job lined up, making me loose access to insurance and everything. Not sure what the future holds for me whether or not I will go back to the job, but I hope I get better mentally and physically in the next 2 months. I thought after going on break from my job I would get right back into my normal self i had no idea I would feel like this mentally, I feel guilty for feeling this way but I can’t help feeling so down. &lt;/p&gt;

I went to a good school but studied fucking music and that seemed to be working out but my father went to prison my last year of college and I just went to shit. Drank way too much. Still moved to NYC because my new dream was to perform. Instead I fell in love with a narcissist coke head that helped get me hooked on the shit. I never needed rehab but I ended up in the hospitality party loop when I should have been auditioning and using my high end connects in my industry. 

I finally got my shit together and my own show in the upper east side and started getting broadway agents calling me in. Then Covid happened. I flipped my unemployment during the crypto craze and moved to the beach in Cali. 

I thought this would be it - finally back to the beach. I can start over. Instead long story short this place has been a fucking nightmare - the one thing I wanted desperately was to fall in love by the ocean and then leave this shit town. I got that opportunity with the perfect guy and instead I just fucked it all up from the beginning. Like I was a grade a psycho the dude doesn’t even want to talk to me anymore. 

I out all my effort into my job which kept laying people off and I ended up the head of two of their companies customer service department. This should have been a 100k+ a year job which would have been GREAT. I would take all the stress and the long hours if I could afford my life after. Instead I made $25 an hour with promises of the future. I would get off work and just be so exhausted from being on the computer I would stare into space until I fall asleep and so it again. So I stopped keeping up with my financials.

Then the guy I fucked it up with just left town and I flipped out. I went out partying again and started doing coke - however ITS NOT COKE HERE. THIS SHIT IS METH.

Anyway the company I gave two years to in hopes of then getting their shit together and paying me properly so I could life the lifestyle I. California I wanted - they just closed shop and let us all go. Right before summer. Right before pride - right after I met someone that could have been a lot of fun if I had money to take him out with. Right before my birthday - right before volleyball season where I was asked to be a part of a team of gays I REALLY wanted to be friends with. 

So instead it’s just been a drunken angry summer and I have pushed away even more friends.

I went to a Halloween party last week and this motherfucker that has beef with me from a year ago got fucked yo and attacked me. I had to have 12 teeth replaced with veneers a while back and I am very proud of my teeth although also self conscious because I need to work on the back. This bitch knocked one out. I was avoiding this asshole ALL NIGHT.

To make it worse I finally got a job at a top restaurant here to hold me until my new remote job starts in a month or so.

I decided out of fear from being attacked I was leaving the city and moving back to Nebraska. So I told my manager this and why wouldn’t be at the second day of training. She didn’t get the voicemail and assumed I no called no showed.

I called the next day and said I think I made a rush decision and it didn’t matter. Job is gone. I understand - but I’m just so sad because if I didn’t lose the fucking tooth I wouldn’t have done that at all. 

That was my saving grace to keep me in Cali. Then when the new remote day job  starts I juggle both or quit the restaurant if I am making enough.

Now I have forced myself to move back in with my parents and I will probably NEVER get my own place again. 

Credit it fucked. Finances are fucked. All because this apt was a nightmare for two year straight. Roaches - no mail - construction everyday all day while working from home. I just wanted to escape my home so I went out looking to fill my void.

,depression,"I realize for most of my time I’ve been craving for compliments from others because it makes me feel GOOD and worthy. I want to be the smartest person in class, the person who did things others cannot, and the person who paid minimum efforts but accomplished so many things as if having a piece of cake. 

Yes I’m a smart ass. I nailed the game of getting compliments by doing nothing more than what teachers and parents asked. I have to say, doing what others ask, and only what others ask, give up your brain, is the fast lane to compliment.

But I also discovered another path to compliment. I intentionally put myself in a disadvantageous position, then get myself back in an extreme way just to prove that I’m capable of doing more. At this moment, compliments from others are no longer what I’m craving for. Self gratification becomes the power. So I learned to torture myself by destroying the advantages I was given and then rebuild all of them from ground. 

The question is, I never actually learned anything. Stretching would be good if I learned anything from anyone or any book. But not, I’m too indulged in self-gratification that I prevent anyone from helping me, preventing me from in taking any new information from other source because I believe I can figure it out. 

Yes, I did figure out one or two things and I’m proud of them. But the cost is 10x or even more. I spent tons of time on trying and erroring instead of thinking of a more effective way to do things. Because of the minor accomplishments, I even look down others because they do not have the accomplishment as I do. By accomplishment, i mean figuring out everything without helping from external world. I become a person hard to communicate and be friend with. 

Question is, there is never enough time; and the world is not me and me alone. What’s more, self-gratification and compliments are not, and should not be the goal of my life. 

I was wrong in the beginning. 

When I began working I finally realized the world is not perfect setup for me. There is no instruction to follow; you need to figure out you own plan. You need to be practical and ask for help. You need to have friends.  

I realized what I nailed - a fast lane to compliment - took me to a deep dark forest that I’m deeply afraid of — the bushes of the uncertainly of non-instruction stumbled me; trees of self-gratification keep alway the true light of the world. And I’m alone in the forest I planted by myself. 

But maybe, maybe I saw a path to the exit. A path of embracing the complexity rather than rejecting it, a path of asking for help rather than dealing everything alone. It would be frustrating at first…but maybe there is something I truly love about that I can find. Maybe I can be free from the burden of self-prove and compliments. 

I don’t know. It seems I fall behind too much. My college friends who entered at the same time are almost 4 years younger than me. My brain was damaged due to anxiety and depression. I become forgetful, I can’t express my thoughts well, I can’t understand conversations and books. It seems I need to construct my reasoning-capacity and knowledge base from ground up. 

The best time to plant a tree is ten years ago, the second is now. I know i need to do something, but I’m scared.  I’m scared to communicate with others of my situation. And I’m scared to face the reality and consequences. I’m scared of no one understands me.

&lt;p&gt;The best time to plant a tree is ten years ago, the second is now. I know i need to do something, but I’m scared.  I’m scared to communicate with others of my situation. And I’m scared to face the reality and consequences. I’m scared of no one understands me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to move. But I’m scared. But I have to move. But I’m scared. But I have to move.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"So. Is this some sort of nostalgic depression or something else? How do I stop? This started right at the end of my 39th year and has been a bit of hell on my 40th.

The past year I have been ate with the thought of that I DONT want to grow up..I dont want my family to grow up.

Why? ---  I Dont want my kids to grow up and leave one day. I dont want my parents to get older.  I Dont want anything to happen to my wife or I.

Why? --- I dont feel like i would ever get to experience these things or moments ever again, be it this time again one day in this life or the after.

But how do I know that we wont get these experiences again? ---  I dont know that I wont. I mean I love the little voices of my children now, the sweet little silly things they do and say, my parents (their grandparents) enjoying these these things, and I really miss the smaller stages. I feel like I missed it by how quick it flew by.

Its like I feel like we are just bits of sand in a hourglass, and the time is just running out non stop. Every day that passes, its like the sand drops faster and faster.

Am I taking everything in with my all? Did I take in everything in the past with my all? If not, I cant go back to be able to. My memory doesnt let me recall what I feel is enough to confirm that I did indeed live in the present through the stages to where we are now.

I cant go back and recreate those exact times \\ feelings \\ memories. I cant go back and right my wrongs. The bits and peices I have are my faint memory and captured videos and pictures. I have a problem with letting things go. I hold on to inanimate objects that have any sort of relation to those special times or memories or baby and toddler stages.(toys, books, clothes, anything...It could be junk). It pains me to think about letting these things go, never to be seen again. It feels like a part of me and these special times, leaves as well.

Why cant I look at these past experiences with 100% happiness? They were happy moments not meant to be seen as sad because they are gone.

I should feel lucky that I get to experience anything. Many husbands / wives / parents never make it to get to experience the things I have. To my knowledge everyone around me is happy and healthy. Tons of people cant say that. Everyone is meant to grow. Us. Our children. Our parents. Everything. Many dont get to see this growth. Be happy.  Why cant I now?

I am a Christian. Not a great one, but I am. Is this happening because Its like I am not sure if this is all we get?  Why do I have any sort of doubt that we wont live forever and Ill be able to be with my loved ones eternal? I doubt and question everything I cant see or do not understand. How do people have that 100% faith?  Would I be and feel better if I did?

Its a little more calming to think that there is the 50% chance that we do indeed all get the chance to be together eternally.

I have been blessed beyond belief with a beautiful and loving wife, amazing children, great family, and all my needs always met. It urks me to think that I wouldnt have all of this forever. But I may?

The unknown. Is that what this all boils down to? Is this what causes the constant battle in my mind and body?

I was the type of guy who would text girls asking for nudes talked to every girl, and didn’t think of women as more than what I could get from them. 

During this time my actions mostly stemmed from the mental health issues I had at the time. I was very depressed all of the time and and would often make self destructive decisions. I thought that I was worthless and didn’t deserve anything so I would make decisions to ruin relationships because I thought I didn’t deserve them. 

I know my actions were bad and affected people negatively and my mental health wasn’t an excuse for the decisions I made. 

Now today 3 years later as a part of my personal journey to bettering myself I have thought that it could be a good idea to make letters or text messages for people who I have said or done things to apologizing for what I had done. 

My concern is that I am not sure if these people would even want to hear from me even if it was an apology. Like some people like to keep things in the past and not like bringing things back up. 

I truly am ashamed of my past and feel like apologizing to people I have mistreated could help me. But I also feel like it’s selfish if I’m doing this for me and it isn’t beneficial to the other person.

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking for some options from other people to get some perspective and figure out if this is an idea I should go thru with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. &lt;/p&gt;

I feel broken, the crushing pain of so much potential inside gone waste is unbearable! &lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately I’m still with the family who caused the trauma bc it’s quite frankly really hard to get out on my own as of now. However I’m definitely not giving up, I am finishing up college really interested in furthering my education and in therapy. The thing is I am better a bit more than I used to be In terms of focusing on myself and not comparing much to others, my self worth is a bit better. I get my assignments done on time, which used to be a problem the others years of college. I actually had to take a break during Covid from uni due to how depressed I was. My void has always been filled with finding someone I admire and wanting to be like them, doing what they do , and finding excitement when they’re around- for me it was always through platonic emotions- a form of 
Obsession  - to someone that had similar looks or backgrounds to me. I know a lot of ppl find themselves obsessing  with a romantic partner to fill this void- I never really had that before. Anwyays, I’m better at it now I know that I can’t unhealthily obsess over someone anymore logically and stopped. However, now I get my school work done spend time in school and even socialize at school. I go to the gym pretty regularly which seems like things that are productive and good. I am seeing the worth in my self little by little but I always seem to fall back to this weird empty bored feeling. Like what’s the point of dressing cute, or buying these cute earrings, or getting a new purse. I quite frankly don’t have a great social life or a hobby. I am starting to think that’s what I’m lacking, especially since I never was able to find my identity with a toxic environment as a child. Long story short, I find myself zombie like going to school to gym to home now, and even though my responsibilities are getting done like homework, or assignments or meetings, I find myself lacking happiness,positivity or purpose. I used to throw myself at low end minimum wage jobs in the past to combat these feelings but they never helped, if anything they would just make me feel more tired and worn out. Of course I want to work eventually again, but right now that’s  not what I want. I do go outside as much as I can, to parks or to walk , so it’s not like I’m stuck home either.

TLDR- After a huge misconception about my mental state and taking a drug that was making me super anxious and depressed, I'm finally coming off of it and feel so much better, but I don't know how to cope with all the harm I have done.


The story begins with OP (newly wed) struggling with work and studies, my wife was having a hard time finding work, and I was a full time student as well as working full time to make ends meet. We were burning through our savings, I was stressed, my grades were dropping, ever since I got into college for even though i was a great student in highschool, not dumb just lazy and I procrastinate hard. So I went to my doctor for help.

I was prescribed effexor 25mg. 

I start waking up with terrible chest pain, heart racing, sweating, anxious. I start being afraid to go to work, I start procrastinating harder.

I go to my doctor and explain I don't think the medicine is helping, (I did not describe the physical symptoms, only the mental ones because I was out of shape and figured this was the cause, stupid I know 20/20 hindsight). Doctor encourages me and ups the dose of the medicine to 50mg later to 75mg.

I continue to spiral downwards, skipping class more, missing work. I become so ANGRY, I'm frustrated at the smallest thing, I'm not happy, I'm constantly angry or feeling an impending sense of doom. I can't remember anything, whole conversations and days are missing from my memory. I am isolating from everyone and everything. I am impulse buying, develop a severe porn addiction. It is bad

I was always a happy guy, nice, patient, hard worker. That is why my wife married me. She is 100% justifiably feeling really betrayed like I had tricked her into thinking I was a good guy. She feels ugly and insecure from the porn addiction I developed. She is angry at me, and scared. She starts yelling, I start yelling, we fight for months and finally split up after 1.2ish years of TRIGGER WARNING SELF HARM: &gt;!I tried to kill myself prior to the splitting up, but luckily was taken to the hospital in time by my wife prior to our splitting up!&lt;

I see a different doctor, get tested for ADHD, turns out it runs in my family and nobody ever told me lol, to be fair I never asked.
I get treated for ADHD, things improve, I get weaned off the effexor slowly, mood and motivation improves, no more missing work, or anxious breakdowns. I'm happy and clear headed. I feel like I have finally woken up from a nightmare.

I have been going strong working hard and doing well for a month now. I moved to a different city to recover and find work elsewhere,  But I am feeling really stuck on the past. 

Even though I was not in my right mind, I was still a jerk. I hurt people I love. I blew people off. People stuck their neck out for me because they knew me before this episode and I let them all down. Also now I have a bad porn problem, like bad bad. Like I start feeling the urge like a smoker kinda bad. Like get in the way of work kinda bad.

I have hurt so many people I love and ruined my reputation. I would have never done/said/acted in the ways I did. I never was an angry or mean person. But regardless that I would have never done it in my right mind, I still did those things and really hurt people I love.  I'm working hard to make things right and have patched up relationships with my good homies. (Crying hugging all the works) I begged their forgiveness and they just said they were so glad I was ""back"" and forgave me immediately. Man I have good friends.

My wife (we are not divorced and haven't seen anyone else but have live separately for half a year now) is having a really hard time ( once again A billion percent justified ) forgiving me. 

I'm working hard to make things right. I'm so angry at myself for how I hurt people. And I am doing all I can but it is not enough and I feel like it never will be enough. I was mean, angry, rude, and just a crappy person. But I don't know how to forgive myself, or to what degree I am responsible for my actions in this time period. I made all these decisions, but I was in a haze and the moment I got better I cried because I couldn't believe all I had done. Lime waking from a nightmare but it's all real. Genuinely the time I was on effexor is a blur, and I don't remember half of it.

I just don't know how to forgive myself. I'm doing all I can. But I feel so heavy. I want to leave it behind, but how can I just forget something so severe??

People stuck their neck out for me because they knew me before this episode and I let them all down. Also now I have a bad porn problem, like bad bad. Like I start feeling the urge like a smoker kinda bad. Like get in the way of work kinda bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have hurt so many people I love and ruined my reputation. I would have never done/said/acted in the ways I did. I never was an angry or mean person. But regardless that I would have never done it in my right mind, I still did those things and really hurt people I love.  I&amp;#39;m working hard to make things right and have patched up relationships with my good homies. (Crying hugging all the works) I begged their forgiveness and they just said they were so glad I was &amp;quot;back&amp;quot; and forgave me immediately. Man I have good friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife (we are not divorced and haven&amp;#39;t seen anyone else but have live separately for half a year now) is having a really hard time ( once again A billion percent justified ) forgiving me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m working hard to make things right. I&amp;#39;m so angry at myself for how I hurt people. And I am doing all I can but it is not enough and I feel like it never will be enough. I was mean, angry, rude, and just a crappy person. But I don&amp;#39;t know how to forgive myself, or to what degree I am responsible for my actions in this time period. I made all these decisions, but I was in a haze and the moment I got better I cried because I couldn&amp;#39;t believe all I had done. Lime waking from a nightmare but it&amp;#39;s all real. Genuinely the time I was on effexor is a blur, and I don&amp;#39;t remember half of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know how to forgive myself. I&amp;#39;m doing all I can. But I feel so heavy. I want to leave it behind, but how can I just forget something so severe??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could really use some advice on how to cope with all this lost time and harm I have done. I would appreciate anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;

So anyway, couldn’t stop smiling away like the moment was just so ridiculous.Everyone shopping for food hustling around filling up their carts in their own bubbles to get their groceries.

I wasn't like this all of the time. When i was young, i was a socially maladjusted. I spent my entire childhood near a PC screen, got overweight. When i was 16 i fell in love, dropped all of my excess weight to anorexic degrees and began to go to a psychiatrist for help. I really was open with everything, i sought help from everywhere i could. I was depressed, but i still saw my future brightly.

I am now 30, and everything got worse. I work a shitty job so i could pay for my studies that i flunked my funding for with a single bad grade. I've got to repeat a semester thrice because i missed an email to re-sign a student contract, and now i missed an email again due to my job being such a toxic environment that my co-worker, who literally just went to jail for being a violent douchebag - left me with all of the work that i can barely handle, and also hates me for being ""critical of him"" (even though everyone else literally thinks he's just dead weight in the job).

Due to this mental stress - i missed an email again by a few days telling me to go sign a contract on the 10-11th of October, which i couldn't do because i work a physical job 6 days a week from 10 to 6 because of the said asshole coworker AND because i need the money to continue studying. My only hope is that they'll not be pissed at me that i missed ANOTHER email from them and will let me sign on Monday.

I don't wanna leave because I truly love him and leaving would make us both spiral deeper into whatever shitstorm we've had this month....... but we literally have fight everyday we are together. 

It's gotten to the point where I don't even know how to self-harm... cause I'm just so averted to pain.. but i literally don't know how else to release this feeling I have.. this hatred towards myself that keeps bubbling over in my mind and making me cry.

,depression,"We have been in a relationship for 2 years and 1 month, long-story short we met when we we're both in a dark place mentally-speaking and ended up being dependent on each other. 10 Months ago we decided to take a break in order to break that dependency and be happy on our own, it was an idea of me after I've noticed it. The rules of the break were simple, no cheating, no lying, no contact and for us to get back together when we're more stable / well mentally. 

I also had a problem with drug abuse (weed) that I had tackled in July of last year but got back to it in Marth of 2024 because of family abuse (I was trying to escape the fear). I had promised her I would not do it again back in December and obviously failed...

In July of 2024 I met a girl (21F) after going to teen meetings (a resource of my city), she contacted me on Messenger and asked if we could talk and be friends to which I agreed.

We ended up spending a lot of time together, watching movies, etc... 2 weeks in and she asked me if I had feelings for her to which I said I didn't and needed more time, not even a few days after she asked me again and I said I did. In all honesty, I didn't really but I felt bad telling her I didn't.

She was also supporting my bad habit by smoking weed with me and taking edibles.

A week in the relationship I asked if we could do ""something"" together (to keep it SFW) which she agreed upon to, I said I was not ready to go beyond basics things but she convinced me and we ended up doing it, me losing  my innocence in the process (to put it that way).

We kept spending some time together afterwards but it always felt off, she always seemed without an ounce of emotions, gaslight me, and tried to make me abandon my cats because I couldn't spend more time with her. I ended up breaking up with her and blocking that person everywhere for my own sake.

In September I ended up telling my gf (now ex) what happened. I felt too much guilt, too much remorse and I couldn't keep it this way anymore, I couldn't keep her in the dark not knowing of the truth it felt so wrong.

She was very hurt and cried when I told her and it broke my heart to see her like that. We ended up breaking up but despite all the hurt I've caused she was still compassionate and chose to stay here for me when I need it, something I'll always be grateful for. She also told me that when we've healed we can be friends and talk again and spend time together again, which is probably the most beautiful part of this story. She also told me about how I was self-destructive with weed and cigs that same day is the same day I stopped weed completely and cold turkey, haven't gone back to it since than and not planning to. 2 Weeks after I switched to vaping to stop smoking cigs as well, now I smoke zero cigs but I vape a lot. 

But the guilt, the remorse on top of the grieving of the amazing relationship I had with her, stayed and took a major part of my daily thinking resulting in depression.

On the 18th of October I called her and told her about my dark thoughts (su\*cidals), she was the only person I felt comfortable talking about it because of my family trauma. I've caused so much pain, so much hurt to such a beautiful person that was amazing to me for years and shattered the relationship and her at the same time. Just talking about it, thinking about it still makes me cry and she told me that I should try to forgive myself but I truly don't know how it feels like an impossible task and on top of that I feel guilt for even reaching out for help to her. I'm the one who broke her heart, who was an a\*\*hole and her, she's still there for me after everything. The pain I feel is never gonna equal what she felt when she heard what I've done and what I've done hurts me a lot, a lot. 

She's the most amazing thing I ever had, our relationship was priceless, I still remember her face, her smile, her eyes, her hair, she is the most beautiful women I've ever seen in my entire life. I see her faces in everyone and the smallest thing makes me remember her. I remember us just playing some games, spending time together, watching movies, it was the most beautiful moments of my life and I might never get that back and that's because of me.

I ended up going to the hospital that night and talking about my dark thoughts, I mentioned the cheating as a part of why I might be depressed and su\*cidal, I was prescribed Prozac and they're looking into getting me therapy but it might be long before I can because of the waiting times here. 

I feel like a fraud because I'm hurting so much when I shouldn't be, I'm not the one who should get therapy, I'm not the one who was betrayed and put aside. The fact that she has to deal with this, with me on top of the hurt she already feels makes me feel really bad.

We've talked a couple more times since and it's been really mature, I said everything I said in this post to her and how I feel and she really comforted me. 

Despite everything, this feeling, those thoughts remain unchanged it's a little better but I, I don't know when it'll change, the depression is so heavy and everyday feels like an eternity. I still can't believe all the hurt I've caused to the most amazing thing I ever had in my entire life. It hurts so much... It's hard to not feel like I'm a waste of a human being who only caused pain to the people who were willing to give me a hand. She have such a pure heart, such a kind soul and to have done that to her, is shameful, it's terrible.

I have so many things to be grateful about yet so many things to be feel guilty about for what I've done in my life including and other than that. 

I hope to get out of this feeling one day. Any advice or comment or comfort is welcome. 

**TL;DR:** I was in a two-year relationship with my girlfriend, and we took a break to work on ourselves and break our dependency on each other. During that time, I struggled with a relapse into weed, met someone else, and ended up in a relationship that quickly turned toxic. Out of guilt, I eventually told my girlfriend, which devastated her, yet she still showed compassion and support. Since then, I quit weed and cigarettes, but I'm overwhelmed by guilt, self-hate, and regret for hurting someone so amazing. I'm now seeking help, trying to forgive myself, and hoping to find peace someday.

All in all, I am alone. One of the most known and talked about people in my local area, I drown myself in drugs and alcohol to take away from the pain of being almost completely alone. Those friends that I do have. I overcompensate with, by buying drinks or presents in a hope they'll stay. 

My relationship, well it feels like kharmas a bitch. In my 20's and early teens I spent my years galavanting around going from girl to girl doing my thing. Never really settling down, there's been good ones and outright bad ones. But this one... 

I've never felt so unloved, unwanted, or unappreciated. Day by day I sit there, knowing full well. If I wasn't around tomorrow, it would be another day to her. There is no fight or care in anything that happens in my life. I've broken my ankle twice in the space of 18 months of being together and not one ounce of care has felt like it's been there.

Theres no point in going forward anymore... there is no light... no help... no family... no friends... No one will ever care about you in this fucking world...

I literally just lost my best friend. AGAIN.

I didn't want to have another best friend after losing my last one... Because i knew if i lost them I'd lose everything. They were my inspiration to keep fighting day after day against my abusive parents. They were my inspiration to go to college and try to find some life for myself, after losing EVERYTHING!! My siblings, my grandparents, my family, the places I've called home,  my aunts, uncles, relatives... my friends... its all gone... there's nothing left... There's no one to fight for, no reason to keep going, theres just... theres just darkness... Thats all I ever find behind every corner, behind every doorway... darkness...

I knew this would happen. I KNEW! I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN!! I knew i would get attached to one person and cling on for dear life until I eventually lost them... He was the only person i hung out with... the only one i was fighting for... the only person who helped me... Then he goes and deletes and destroys everything we ever made together. All our memories... all our past fun times... its all gone, and it means nothing to him anymore...


This... this is pointless... 

Im sick of growing up in a world that wanted me dead even before I was a teenager or an adult! I'm TIRED of all the pain and misery!! WHAT IS THE POINT OF FRIENDS OR FAMILY IF ALL THEY DO IS HURT US?!! WHY CAN'T I FIND ANYONE WHO CARES ABOUT ME!!?!?

 This is all pointless. Theres nothing left. There's no reason to keep talking to an empty audiance. No reason to keep going... No one will even read this...

But hey, if you do...? pray for me and my last night alive... I'm just gonna take some pills with my favorite beverage.

I wont be missed. So goodbye, no one.

,depression,"Simple context: I’m a 20 yr old obese white male college student with physical and mental health problems.

Long context: is my life even worth showing off to people anymore? I’ve felt like ever since I’ve joined college my life has gotten so much worse. I’ve had depression, anxiety and suicidal tendencies in the past, but it hasn’t been this bad. Let me go ahead and list all of the stupid mistakes my small pea brain has made in the past 2 years alone:

1. I wrote an erotic bluey fanfic involving aged up characters and drove people away from me after mistakenly bringing it up in detail.

2. I joined a fraternity (which I thought was a good idea for some reason), only to discover my money is being sent straight to bomb innocent children in Gaza, and bringing this fact up with anyone in this Hyper-Liberal campus is an automatic death sentence.

3. Continuing to find “love”, only to have it result in convoluted dates and sex mistakes that instantly turn people away from me and label me as nothing more than a “creep”

4. Not doing any personal hygiene whatsoever, so everyone can smell my musk and unwashed ass which further turns people away from me.

5. I’ve lost all focus in my studies and I’ve resorted to short form content online.

Not only has all these things been happening, but also things completely out of my control. 

1. My heart aching every single second of the day, fainting spells and frequent chest pain that’s kept me on edge for months

2. These goddamn street preachers who come on campus every fucking day and yell into my ear to “repent” and “find Jesus” like it will fix all of my problems.

3. My autism making it hard for me to have a basic fucking interaction with anyone and making me look like a complete idiot

4. My depression coming back, melting all of my hobbies and motivation away.

Nowadays it’s an uphill struggle to get up from my bed and get to class, hell it’s even an uphill battle to even be alive. I might as well live in a log cabin off the grid in buttfuck nowhere Montana and not have to deal with talking to people, but even still I will have to get a job and interact with people which I don’t want to do. If I don’t get a job, I’ll go homeless, and maybe THEN I will have the possibility of having no interaction with anybody. Gee, isn’t life such a wonder? How am I supposed to trust people if all they’re going to do is disappoint me in the end? How am I supposed to believe some sky daddy exists when he could easily make my illnesses go away and end hunger in Africa. Hell, how am I supposed to love myself if I fill up my entire body with pure spite? 

Why should I bother with all this crap? It’s better to just stay inside and just mellow in your own sadness, your life will be a thousand times better. I hope people my age never have to deal with what I’m going through, because every second is living hell for me.

All and all, my life sucks, and I have no idea how to fix it. That’s why I come here, what baseless nonsense can you fuckers say to me that will make me magically better? It’s better to not even respond, like I need help anyway. Every jolt of energy my body makes to type out this autobiography could better better suited in running the engines in coal factories. What could possibly save me? I don’t know.

,depression,"I don't really have anyone in my life that I can open up to about all of this. The few left or the few who know me view me as full of shit, or irresponsible, or stupid, or a dumb patriarchal man (which I really am not, I was the scrawny kid in the background most of the time). Or I 'never learn' because I've made mistakes and didn't invest myself with the 'right' people at the 'right' time irrespective of the medical issues I was going through.

I wan't smart enough, competitive enough, athletic enough, strong enough student or employee. Every time I made some significant progress I was laid off or I earned being fired for fucking up. Yes I made some mistakes, all of them out of working my ass off to 'shine' so that I could advance - I made some mistakes out of exhaustian that manifested out of the hustle culture that dominates our economy. For men professional advancment and earning power are the only things that give them value, other than how much money we can produce we have zero intrinsic value in our culture. That and our value as cannonfodder in times of war, men are as disposeable as employees are to corporations.

I wish I'd had the confidence to have a family, I never felt I could actually do that till in my mid thirties. And I fucked up the relationships where that could have happened in my 20's. Most of the women I met in my late thirties and early fourties either already had thier own kids or didn't want them. I only began to understand my feeling of loss around family in my early 40's. It would have been tough but I do believe ultimately having a family and being a parent can be one of the deepest most fullfilling aspects of life.

All I ever wanted to was make a decent living doing something that was resonably fullfilling. When the rubber met the road and the emotional support I needed from my family would have made the difference, they didn't show up. Only after I'd flailed and flailed and flailed and I'd come back begging would they reach out and provide the support I needed and asked for. The assumption that money, housing, privildged events and objects are enough to support and raise a kid is gravely mistaken. My parents believed in tough love and that's what I got when I really needed love and support. The pain and damage I earned from the world as a result either broke me or nearly broke me and they'd gather me up or I'd come begging for help at the end of my rope.

I just can't get thrown in the trash for a CEO's bonus next quarter any longer. That was basically my professional career, things would be going well, the company would get aquired by venture capital or by a more agile competetor, and I get laid off so the accountants could make the numbers look good enough for the next round of quarterly profits.

I have nothing of real value in my life. No children, no wife or girlfriend. I love my dog but the reality is she's cute enough that a family will want to care for her after I'm gone. That's my only thing left, I've got to find a decent home for her before I go.

I've got a number of health issues that make it hard for me to grind for the corporate god like I used to be able to. I just can't physically do it anymore, and I haven't wanted to do it for years now. My last really good gig with some real opportunity for me, I was able to justify grinding myself to death in support of my team mates within the company, but that really doesn't matter in the sceme of things either.

My longest and best friend in the world finally came down to my city to hang and talk, asked me not to give up. Seems like too little too late is the running theme across my life. I love him and his wife and family, but I just wasn't enough and I won't continue to grind myself to dust for nothing. I am a wobbly wheel.

Corporations cannot forgive human frailty, wobbly wheels will not be tolerated. Unless of course you're already a member of the owner class. Which I failed to make myself a part of, and yes ultimately I'm at fault for failing at creating enough wealth or value to achive that.

I wish I'd done better but that is that.

My failure means eventually I'd be evicted from my home and my possesions strip mined from my upon my loss and I'd spend years homeless on the street till my body fails.

The corporate profit machine will pick me apart for whatever value it can, but I'm not going to live in the pain that would require and the chronic pain I've lived with for decades that's only gotten worse and worse over the last 8 or 9 years.

I know that life has more to offer than grinding it out for my corporate betters in the c suite, board room and investment portfolio. Unfortunatly I never made myself valueable enough to rise above that. I don't want to live my remaining years on the street. I'm alone now and it's hard enough while I still own my house.

I'll be out of money soon, I have to find a safe place for my pup and then I'll be ending it. I hope you all get some joy out of my possessions I'm leaving behind. I wish I'd done better but it is what it is.

In my thirties I had a plan for a finacially safe future, but I fucked up executing it. I got laid off a number of times or couldn't handle the corporate grind or bullshit and got fired. I know it's my fault at the end of the day.

I still have enough agency to end my life on my terms instead of being forced out into the gutter. It's going to be painful but a few minutes of pain is better than weeks or months of misery before the elements consume me.

It would have been tough but I do believe ultimately having a family and being a parent can be one of the deepest most fullfilling aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I ever wanted to was make a decent living doing something that was resonably fullfilling. When the rubber met the road and the emotional support I needed from my family would have made the difference, they didn&amp;#39;t show up. Only after I&amp;#39;d flailed and flailed and flailed and I&amp;#39;d come back begging would they reach out and provide the support I needed and asked for. The assumption that money, housing, privildged events and objects are enough to support and raise a kid is gravely mistaken. My parents believed in tough love and that&amp;#39;s what I got when I really needed love and support. The pain and damage I earned from the world as a result either broke me or nearly broke me and they&amp;#39;d gather me up or I&amp;#39;d come begging for help at the end of my rope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#39;t get thrown in the trash for a CEO&amp;#39;s bonus next quarter any longer. That was basically my professional career, things would be going well, the company would get aquired by venture capital or by a more agile competetor, and I get laid off so the accountants could make the numbers look good enough for the next round of quarterly profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have nothing of real value in my life. No children, no wife or girlfriend. I love my dog but the reality is she&amp;#39;s cute enough that a family will want to care for her after I&amp;#39;m gone. That&amp;#39;s my only thing left, I&amp;#39;ve got to find a decent home for her before I go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a number of health issues that make it hard for me to grind for the corporate god like I used to be able to. I just can&amp;#39;t physically do it anymore, and I haven&amp;#39;t wanted to do it for years now. My last really good gig with some real opportunity for me, I was able to justify grinding myself to death in support of my team mates within the company, but that really doesn&amp;#39;t matter in the sceme of things either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My longest and best friend in the world finally came down to my city to hang and talk, asked me not to give up. Seems like too little too late is the running theme across my life. I love him and his wife and family, but I just wasn&amp;#39;t enough and I won&amp;#39;t continue to grind myself to dust for nothing. I am a wobbly wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporations cannot forgive human frailty, wobbly wheels will not be tolerated. Unless of course you&amp;#39;re already a member of the owner class. Which I failed to make myself a part of, and yes ultimately I&amp;#39;m at fault for failing at creating enough wealth or value to achive that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I&amp;#39;d done better but that is that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My failure means eventually I&amp;#39;d be evicted from my home and my possesions strip mined from my upon my loss and I&amp;#39;d spend years homeless on the street till my body fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corporate profit machine will pick me apart for whatever value it can, but I&amp;#39;m not going to live in the pain that would require and the chronic pain I&amp;#39;ve lived with for decades that&amp;#39;s only gotten worse and worse over the last 8 or 9 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that life has more to offer than grinding it out for my corporate betters in the c suite, board room and investment portfolio. Unfortunatly I never made myself valueable enough to rise above that. I don&amp;#39;t want to live my remaining years on the street. I&amp;#39;m alone now and it&amp;#39;s hard enough while I still own my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be out of money soon, I have to find a safe place for my pup and then I&amp;#39;ll be ending it. I hope you all get some joy out of my possessions I&amp;#39;m leaving behind. I wish I&amp;#39;d done better but it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my thirties I had a plan for a finacially safe future, but I fucked up executing it. I got laid off a number of times or couldn&amp;#39;t handle the corporate grind or bullshit and got fired. I know it&amp;#39;s my fault at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have enough agency to end my life on my terms instead of being forced out into the gutter. It&amp;#39;s going to be painful but a few minutes of pain is better than weeks or months of misery before the elements consume me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be a nice little profit in the P&amp;amp;L of the companies that will collect my body and part out all my possessions. You&amp;#39;re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"For context I’m a 28F who had my first depressive episode in college, where I had suicidal ideations, intrusive thoughts, and even had to repeat a year of college because I was skipping class so much and eventually was able to overcome that with therapy. I finally got a dr. To prescribe me an antidepressant 3 years later but that was only because they didn’t want to treat my ADHD with stimulants so they off label gave me Wellbutrin and hydroxyzine for anxiety (which I only took when I felt like I was actually going to have a panic attack. 

Anyway, these did help me to not struggle with suicidal thought and intrusive thoughts which I had basically since late teen hood. It was my normal. Did nothing for the ADHD though lol. However, this only worked until I was pregnant in with my first. I had very bad antepartum depression but it went away as soon as my daughter barring a few random slumps where I contemplated leaving my family or harming myself. But there was like only 2 of those and they happened suddenly and dissipated suddenly like within 48 hours. But when I look back i was the happiest I had ever been in my whole life. I finally felt like I knew what happiness was. 

After a rushed move I didn’t fully agree with I went back into a type of sadness. For most of my life I’ve never been truly joyful and happy. But it’s also rare that I’m so sad that I can’t hold down a job or do general hygiene that’s happened once in college. So because I’m able to get up every morning without consistent crying spells I never consider I might need help or might be depressed until I am in the suicidal ideation stage. 

Well over the last two days I haven’t even been able to function. I’m a teacher which is stressful on its own. But I’ve always been able to find a reason to keep going. In may I was so excited to deliver my son early just so I wouldn’t have to deal with the end of year. I wasn’t totally hopeless though. However, the birth of my son was hard emotionally and physically. I struggled to bond with him from the beginning, despite loving him. The mother instinct did not come in the same way it did with my daughter. It just didn’t feel right. Over the summer I occasionally would find myself fantasizing about disappearing and not telling anyone or just taking a really long extended vacation. This kind of thinking really does scare me. I don’t actually want to do something like that. I was barely able to physically function again when school started. I knew I wasn’t ready to return but I need my job. Ever since I’ve been struggling to feel happy about anything. Yesterday I realized how bad my brain fog was when I couldn’t even read my lesson plans or teach a very simple lesson without forgetting what I was doing immediately. It’s like my body is going around doing the things but my head checked out and is not with me because I literally can’t not connect to my own thoughts. I tried to push through today but struggled not to walk into my boss’s office and tell her that I’m resigning. So I just had my aide take over and I left. I just can’t even think.

,depression,"I am in my mid 20s and this is my first post here on reddit i used to read stories and posts but never dare to write one, but today I forced myself to speak about things
I am introvert and I don't have much offline friends and all of them whom I had are not with me anymore.
I have always been there for their emotional support or listened to them whenever they were struggling with things in life and now when it's my turn there's literally no one to talk to and i cry all night not able to sleep, eat anything and its just a weird like not even feeling excited to do anything.
I think it's my bad time which has started and will not end soon 
I don't come from financially strong background, and started working from past three years after my college and I have so many dreams in my life but don't know how I will financially achieve them and i never talked to any girl till my college days but lately like from past 6 months I was very much attached and started liking a girl from another country but lately she says she has no clarity about me and she needs to concentrate on her job after her promotion and we can't talk anymore and I had only one friend who i used to talk is also not available, these days my work life is so hectic that I spend most of my time over there but still recently its been told I have poor performance and I can't speak up to my parents about all of these things and to friends who were in touch all these days have ghosted me giving some or other reason

I am introvert and I don&amp;#39;t have much offline friends and all of them whom I had are not with me anymore.
I have always been there for their emotional support or listened to them whenever they were struggling with things in life and now when it&amp;#39;s my turn there&amp;#39;s literally no one to talk to and i cry all night not able to sleep, eat anything and its just a weird like not even feeling excited to do anything.
I think it&amp;#39;s my bad time which has started and will not end soon 
I don&amp;#39;t come from financially strong background, and started working from past three years after my college and I have so many dreams in my life but don&amp;#39;t know how I will financially achieve them and i never talked to any girl till my college days but lately like from past 6 months I was very much attached and started liking a girl from another country but lately she says she has no clarity about me and she needs to concentrate on her job after her promotion and we can&amp;#39;t talk anymore and I had only one friend who i used to talk is also not available, these days my work life is so hectic that I spend most of my time over there but still recently its been told I have poor performance and I can&amp;#39;t speak up to my parents about all of these things and to friends who were in touch all these days have ghosted me giving some or other reason

A leap is a leap

Whether you land on your feet

Or fall on your face

The action is still the same

Jumping without a plan

Planning to jump without resolve

Rotting away in place

,depression,"On my 28th birthday, my life was not how I wanted it to be. I had a normal job that I didn't really like, not many friends, a relationship that wasn't really working, but I had a lovely cat. I had a lot of unresolved issues from the past, and I was very depressed. I'd been depressed and often suicidal since I was a teenager. 

Anyway, I told myself that I needed to turn my life around before 30, otherwise, I might as well end my worthless life. So I started working on making changes. I went to the gym to build more self-esteem, I started dressing better, I made some amazing new friends, and I tried to improve things with my boyfriend and at work. But my boss was terrible, and the salary was even worse, so I found a job in another country and moved there. I made new friends, I had plans to bring my cat with me, and I hoped to get my boyfriend to move with me too...

So, on my 29th birthday, I was happier than the year before. I was proud of what I was doing.

But then I realized that the new job was even worse than the previous one, the new friends turned out to be manipulative jerks, my cat died, and my boyfriend and I broke up. So now, I’m far away from my family and real friends, without a boyfriend, without my cat, stuck in a job I dislike, completely burnt out, and with no friends nearby to even grab a drink with.

,depression,"I had a suicide attempt last month. It was after a particularly bad year, and years of trying to get helping but nothing ever working. Im not going to go into detail on it, but my liver and kidneys were failing and it almost cost me my life. Shortly after I got diagnosed with bpd (which explained a lottttt) but it doesn’t make life any easier. 

A few days after getting out of hospital I started a new job and have been working it since. It’s fine, it’s Monday to Friday and the work is easy enough, but it’s terrifying because  I’m so exhausted every day after work and on weekends. I have breakdowns every second morning for no reason and I have almost had to call into work sick because I can’t stop crying. I’m so scared I’m going to screw this job up because I can’t keep my emotions in check and sometimes can’t focus on the work I’m doing because I’m focused on not having a breakdown at my desk. 

My social life is nothing to brag about, in the past few months I have lost my closest friend (surprisingly through no fault of my own, she ended up betraying me in a way I never could’ve imagined). I think for a while she was my fp, but now I just don’t have one and it’s kind of lonely. Not that I would ever tell anyone that, I’m trying to keep up the facade of moving on from that friendship with my head held high. I have other friends and I love them, but I still feel alone because they have their own lives and are busy. 

It doesn’t help that I’m not on meds anymore. I had been on sertraline but since the attempt I’ve been taken off everything. I feel like my mood swings are so much worse now, like I can be smiling and laughing one minute and sobbing crying the next.

I feel like every day is just one day closer to a huge breakdown that will ruin my life and I don’t know how to stop it. I try to be rational with my emotions but they’re genuinely so overwhelming that when I start feeling/thinking a certain way it’s so difficult to shake it, and even then the feeling always comes back the next day. I wish I could just switch off my emotions sometimes to stop them from controlling me. I know I’ll never attempt again, I couldn’t do it, but I feel trapped in this life and don’t know what to do.

,depression,"I have been feeling depressed since I was 12-13, wanted and tried to off myself multiple times only failing because I’m a coward and give up when it gets painful. I have almost no memory anymore and thus can’t tell how I interpreted it at first but until 3-4 years ago I thought it was normal, the world is a sad place and I’m being a little bitch about it. But two years ago I started hanging with people who talked and expressed their emotions a lot and it kind of fucked me up since I have been losing my emotions for years.

So comes summer of 2023 and I try to get tested for memory or focus deficit since I had been in university for 5 years and hadn’t finished a 3 years bachelor. During the testing sessions, the neuropsychologist didn’t pay attention at all and let the intern do everything (it clearly was their first time) and concluded with « You’re normal. Just sleep, eat and study. If it’s not enough go see a therapist ». 

At first I was against it since in my family it was considered akin to voodoo and astrology but tried it since I was going to burn down everything and myself with it so why not waste this time and off myself later? I went for 7 months with no advancement whatsoever and the therapist even sent me to another one because my case was outside of her domain of expertise and therefore she was out of depth. The second one started doing the exact same pointless routine so I stopped going.

Finally, after a consultation with my doctor, he advised me to go see a psychiatrist. Problem is, they’re all overbooked since covid so I could only get a 3 session diagnosis during which we clearly established that I was depressive and suicidal and a brain activity test showed that I had an hormones imbalance in my brain causing it to not work as it should. I was even prescribed a dose of antidepressants targeted to mdd (major depressive disorder) patients at the first session so I thought we were finally going somewhere. But then at the last session the conclusion was « No depression, no mental illness, not suicidal. Must continue to take a double dose of medication until January where he should consult his doctor ». I was quite surprised since we spoke of the fact that I have had the same growing problem for 12 years and that I planned my death multiple times failing only because of my lack of means and/or my inability to perform any action at all. 

So now I’ve been taking antidepressants at a major depression dosage for the past 4 months with no visible effects with no apparent reason as for what is causing all this. Thus I am once again going feral and my only option to prevent it is to become a slug doing nothing at all every day. 

Sorry for the rant but the situation was already bad enough before all this and now it just feels like the specialists don’t take it seriously or are mocking me and I have no idea what to do anymore. It feels like I will snap at any moment and become violent and dangerous to other people.

,depression,"Hi Everyone. I am looking for sound advice and perspectives on how to help my adult daughter. Just a bit of background..She's single, a sweetheart, and very lovely and intelligent. As a family, we've experienced a lot of loss until all that is left is myself and my two daughters. We lost her dad (my dear hubby) when she was young so it's just been the three of us. For economic reasons, we live together and also because we genuinely love to be close. We are all college educated ,employed and introverted. Makes for a peaceful house...for the most part. 

We all struggle to various degrees with our mental health. The loss of family and just life in general is hard to deal with. It seems that my daughter struggles the most. She refuses to take medication, or do any of the holistic suggestions to help herself. As her mother, my heart breaks when I see her in pain, but I find myself also frustrated that she won't take care of herself. Recently a situation occurred that she did not deserve. This event has taken her to the depths of despair and now she's talking about 'ending it all'. We made an agreement that either she would see a doctor or I would have to get emergency medical help to intervene in order to keep her safe. She agreed, so hopefully she follows through tomorrow. My other daughter stayed up through the night watching her, and I took off work today to be with her. I'm at a loss. She's been through so much and is such a sweetheart and she doesn't bother anyone.

,depression,"I've been unemployed since graduation for 15 months. Throughout those 15 months I've submitted 100s of job applications and attended 10s of interviews. I started getting better at answering all the questions that interviewers threw at me and became adept at hiding personal traits which may prevent me from getting the job. After 15 gruelling months, I have finally gotten a job offer, slightly below average salary but a working environment where i can learn and grow.

However, I can't stop thinking about what's the point of all of this. I have gotten so skillful at describing another person with the same name but none of the negative traits. I lied about past internships, i lied about hard and soft skills, i flash countless smiles during my interviews just to appear friendly/positive.

I've been sitting on this for months now... Frankly, it feels embarrassing and pitiful to even talk about. But my depression flared and hit like a truck during COVID, and I had been having an increasingly difficult time taking care of myself until, invariably, everything was falling apart and trashed. 



This includes my place. Hip high piles of garbage everywhere, half the kitchen is pizza boxes, you cant walk without having to take (big) steps over piles and just walls of trash I casually assembled over the last few years. Shockingly, no rodents or insects, least once I got rid of the fruitfly nest... But that will change if this keeps up, I'm sure. 



But... Now I'm getting proper help (key word being proper... Salty about that still) I'm starting to come out of that depressive haze, and can see what's around me again... The trouble is that between my damaged spine (IDK what it's issue is, but I pull it constantly...) and ADHD (I have insanely bad executive dysfunction in particular), I've been unable to do much but scratch the surface in 2 years. Sometimes I can beat myself into picking up a few piles... But 1-2 trashbags later and I'm exhausted. 



The worst thing is? Thats just the tip of the iceberg... And after the effort and energy it took to even get started, then seeing how I didnt make so much as a dent... I feel even worse x.x ... I feel like I'm just being stupid and lazy because if I had done this a year ago when the problem started to be a problem, it'd never have been and it'd have been super easy and now it's not. I literally do not understand how people manage this normally x.x... 



TL;DR



Are there \*any\* kind of services for people like me? That are just societal failures and cant manage to keep a half clean place?

I never saw a future with him and just wanted to go with the flow. Had he been honest and gentle about it, I (probably, maybe) would be okay with him telling me that he was not interested anymore...but ghosting truly hurt me (and my ego).

-Oscar Wilde 

Oscar Wilde was a man with whom I would have given life and limb to have a friend like. I've found myself going through his literature lately, and found myself loving his works all over again, but for some reason, this time, when I read this, it made my heart shatter. Living to my 30s I've found myself being put into situations where I've been forced to put my morals to the test. I had a friend whose trust I failed by keeping silent when I should have spoken, I've lost love but house that person freely as they are unable to provide for themselves and ask nothing in return, I've stood my ground in the face of those that would say I am not who I say I am, but in the end, none are there when I'm in need, and one would think that it's because none would be worthy to take part in my pain, but no, those I've tried to share my pain with have felt me unfit after hearing my pain. From my teenage years I struggled through a lot nobody should have to face, and I kept marching, moving along because I told myself it was in defiance of those that would want me dead, but the older I get, the more I'm looking back and finding nobody wishing my death, just ambivalence, silence, I learned very early on I couldn't share most of my life with anyone, but I found what I could share was less and less until I realized, nobody cares what's going on with me, they all, each and every one, just want me for their own entertainment. I have nothing left, but I keep marching, I'm so tired, why am I still marching?",t2_30z523zw,False,,0,False,Of friends and worthiness ,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_1gb8645,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1729790762.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If a friend of mine gave a feast, and did not invite me to it, I should not mind a bit. but if a friend of mine had a sorrow and refused to allow me to share it, I should feel it most bitterly.

&lt;p&gt;Oscar Wilde was a man with whom I would have given life and limb to have a friend like. I&amp;#39;ve found myself going through his literature lately, and found myself loving his works all over again, but for some reason, this time, when I read this, it made my heart shatter. Living to my 30s I&amp;#39;ve found myself being put into situations where I&amp;#39;ve been forced to put my morals to the test. I had a friend whose trust I failed by keeping silent when I should have spoken, I&amp;#39;ve lost love but house that person freely as they are unable to provide for themselves and ask nothing in return, I&amp;#39;ve stood my ground in the face of those that would say I am not who I say I am, but in the end, none are there when I&amp;#39;m in need, and one would think that it&amp;#39;s because none would be worthy to take part in my pain, but no, those I&amp;#39;ve tried to share my pain with have felt me unfit after hearing my pain. From my teenage years I struggled through a lot nobody should have to face, and I kept marching, moving along because I told myself it was in defiance of those that would want me dead, but the older I get, the more I&amp;#39;m looking back and finding nobody wishing my death, just ambivalence, silence, I learned very early on I couldn&amp;#39;t share most of my life with anyone, but I found what I could share was less and less until I realized, nobody cares what&amp;#39;s going on with me, they all, each and every one, just want me for their own entertainment. I have nothing left, but I keep marching, I&amp;#39;m so tired, why am I still marching?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I (18F) am starting to think that I’m depressed. I have pretty much all the symptoms. I don’t know what to do. I can’t bring myself to tell my family because I don’t want them to worry or go out of their way to treat me differently or try to fix me. I don’t want them to make me see a doctor or anything either. 

But there’s something within me that desperately wants to tell someone. Something that wants to cry for help. But I just can’t. I don’t have many friends but I almost told my closest friend when she sensed something was off when I was texting her and asked if I needed to vent. I was so close to telling her but something stopped me. I don’t know why I can’t open up to people but now I kind of really wish I told her. 

I just wish I had someone who would understand. Someone who wouldn’t pressure me to get better. Someone who would treat me normally but understand when I was down. 

I want someone who would tell me that’s okay. 

But I’m too scared to tell my friends. I’m worried that if I let them know and if I stop pretending to be happy around them, if I’m less fun, they’ll leave me. I’m worried they won’t like me anymore. I’m worried they won’t want to hang out with me anymore. Maybe I’m just insecure, but idk. I kind of can’t afford to lose the few friends I have because I find it really difficult to make friends because of my social anxiety. 

I’m also worried that if I told someone they’d ask me why I feel like this, because honestly I’m not even sure of why myself. I kind of haven’t figured that out. I mean there are a bunch of reasons and I guess maybe they all just add up. 

I’m also not 100% sure if it is depression, but I think it is. And I don’t want to hurt myself or anything like that so at least it’s not like I’m in any real danger. But I’ve lost interest in things I used to like and most of the time I feel sad, angry, or nothing at all. I feel tired and bored and unmotivated all the time.

Figured this would be the best place to ask. I was on Effexor for years for panic attacks every day. It helped for my anxiety, but I noticed constant fatigue, apathy, just don’t have motivation to do anything anymore. I always want to nap, don’t even have motivation to have sex. After doing some research, I found maybe it was from the medication I was taking. So I switched to Prozac as Effexor withdrawals are horrible, and figured maybe a different medication would be better. I felt amazing for a week after withdrawals went away, was energetic and wanted to do things and was motivated. Then, the symptoms of apathy came back. So I cut my Prozac dose from 40 mg to 20 mg, had some light withdrawal symptoms, but again, felt super energetic and felt much better for about a week. Then, symptoms returned. Am I just experiencing heightened energy from withdrawals? Or will I actually have my energy back if I get off this stuff? It’s beginning to really impact my life and my mental health.

And i didnt even know i was addicted until last year when all of a sudden i started getting dizzy after each time i did it. And i have lived with that dizziness for the last 1 and a half year, even though it has become a lot better since the beginning because i do it way less frequently compared to how much i did it before. Sounds absurd but i used to do it like 4 or 5 times evrry single fucking day for fucking 5 years and i thought it was okay. I started keeping a record of everyday that i didnt do it since last year and i have been showing some progress, i havent done it for 170 days this year.

It all started last year when  I got out from a long term relationship, lasted 6 years. He was my first boyfriend and I really thought we were end game. I already saw some red flags early in our relationship but shrugged it off, he gave me the bare minimum and I was okay with it . I learned a lot from the relationship and I’m still suffering from it. I already grieved the relationship but I think the betrayal was so intense that up until now, I cannot accept why he did it to me and why I deserved that . I said to myself I needed to help myself get out of this shithole and I went to a psychiatrist for medicine. I was given Setraline and Exulten. But sadly I was not able to continue those sessions and buy those medicines because it was expensive for me.

Then 2024 came. My brother passed away due to suicide. I know he was struggling with his mental illness and I too was struggling during those time. I would give him part of my medicine but when I stopped getting it, he also stopped taking the medicine. I feel a lot of guilt because I cannot provide for my brother and was not able to console him while he was still alive. Maybe if we have enough money I let him see a psychologist or a therapist. 

Last 5 months ago, I feel okay. Okay in a sense that I work, go home, eat then sleep. I feel like a shell or like a living dead. Sometimes I just wake up and would repeat these dragging days.

But now, I can feel the depression is eating me again. I cannot sleep. I haven't have a quality sleep for 3 months already. My hormones are acting up and I’m having an acne breakout. I only drink water. I sometimes get hungry but when I eat I feel like vomiting. I know I am depressed again and I’m scared that I cannot take it anymore. Sometimes I wish I can be with my brother in heaven  but I know my family will be devastated again. I keep telling myself that its a permanent solution to a temporary problem. But right now, I’m just really tired of living.

Since I cannot afford therapy or antidepressants, the only thing that I can do right now is to pray and ask God to help me. But these are the times when your faith is really tested when all you can see are trials in life. My family is loving and supportive, but I know they have their fair share of grief and I don’t want to burden them anymore.

I'm stressed from every angle because at school cause we have a lot of exams this year and I get home and everyone's screaming or he's just annoying me the second I'm in the door. My mom when she gets mad she screams like crazy and my dad is becoming so distant and he was the only nice one in this damn family. 
I talk to my friends and stuff but I don't wanna burden them with my problems because they have stuff too and honestly I don't wanna lose them because it feels like they're the only positive in my life.
I just wanna cry all the time and binge eat because i feel like shit but I'm trying to eat one meal a day at most because i refuse to be depressed and fat but it's not fast enough. Why is everyone else so much prettier!!?? Like I want your fast metabolism please share.

,depression,"Hi everyone,

I’m 23, and I’ve struggled with depression for most of my life, but over the past few years, things have gotten worse. I used to be more outgoing and less harsh on myself, but now I criticize everything I do, even though I also feel numb in a way I can’t fully explain. It’s like I’ve lost all interest in the things I used to enjoy, and I don’t even try to get out anymore because nothing feels fun or worthwhile.

I’ve tried several times to pull myself out of this rut, but every attempt seems to bring me back to square one, and now I’m at the point where I don’t even see the point in trying. I feel like I’m wasting time, especially because I just turned 23 and the last few years have flown by. There’s this overwhelming sense of time slipping away, but no clear direction on what to do about it.

Sometimes I just want to escape everything and travel, but I feel stuck, unmotivated, and uncertain about what life has in store for me — if anything. Has anyone else experienced this kind of long-term rut? How do you deal with the sense that life is passing you by, and have any of you managed to get out of something like this?

,depression,"A few months back, my partner (35F) ghosted me (30F) for a few days and it kind of fucked me up. I wish I could talk to them about it, but I'm scared it causes another ghosting. 

Just as a sidenote, I have a chronic illness and disability which prevents me from being able to work. And due to my illness and the treatment required, my partner and I had to do long distance.

The context of the ghosting was that they were overwhelmed and done with me and was mad at me and just didn't want to talk to me. (The reason being I was having meltdown after meltdown- which I know affects people badly, but I didn't know how to make it stop then.) It left me in a blubbering mess, with so much anger and anxiety. The fear that this is how it ends... That those were the last words we would share. Because they had never done this before. It was a really hard time for me, but not so much for my partner, initially. They were super busy with work, so they didn't actually have much time to think on it. Meanwhile I am across the country, bedbound and worried sick. Like I was literally sick. They came back to me a few days later and apologized but I guess the damage to my brain was done.

Man... I rly should talk to them about it.

And randomly, today, I realized one of my best friends had not responded to my texts for five days and I flipped. This was so unlike them! I went into crazy anxiety mode. I started texting them on multiple platforms and calling them and texting their partner too. I was sucked into a breakdown, suddenly haunted by thoughts of ""What did I do wrong?"" ""Did they not want to be my friend anymore?"" ""Did they hate me?"" ""What if they're hurt or really unwell?"" And the feelings and thoughts were similar to what I went through when my partner ghosted me. They later replied. And I can't say what they said exactly. But it's something like they have a lot on their plate and can't respond yet. I was relieved! But my anxiety is still so so high. I still feel like I did something wrong. Like I'm not good enough. I feel like I'm crazy. I'm so tired of being fucked like this--- and most of the fuckery is internal... And I don't know what to do with this residual anxiety. I'm holding back tears as I type this. I feel like an idiot. A crazy, paranoid idiot.

I'm not sure what to do about this yet. Like, how do I fix me in the long term? I'm so tired of my brain attacking me like that :(

,depression,"Hello, Reddit community,

I’m reaching out because I’m currently navigating some tough times with my mental health and family dynamics, and I could really use your support and advice. For the past couple of years, I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety, which has affected my ability to attend school regularly. I’ve been working on my healing journey, and things have been improving, but I still have a long way to go.

Recently, I was asked to come to school to sign up for an important exam. The situation has been complicated because the last time I interacted with the vice principal, I shared my mental health struggles with her, hoping for understanding. Instead, she dismissed my feelings, saying, “It can’t be you; you don’t have any illnesses,” and even went so far as to insult my family. This experience left me feeling humiliated and has made me dread the idea of going back.

On top of this, I’m also facing significant challenges at home. My mom often disrespects me, body shames me, and seems to favor my cousins over me. She talks negatively about me to other people, which has made me feel unworthy and has taken a toll on my mental health.

Now, I feel stuck between wanting to move forward with my education and the anxiety that comes from facing someone who has treated me so poorly. I’m considering not going to school tomorrow, but I’m worried about the implications for my exam.

I’d love to hear from anyone who has faced similar challenges—how did you cope with unsupportive school environments and difficult family dynamics? What steps did you take to prioritize your mental health while still pursuing your education? Any tips for communicating with school authorities or handling difficult situations would be immensely helpful.

,depression,"Hi, 35F here and I really need a place to vent, so bear with me. 

I've felt like a spectator of my own life since I can remember. My entire life I've been psychologically, emotionally and sexually abused by my family and others. I grew up feeling lonely, even though I had a few friends, because I've never felt comfortable in my own skin. I took care of my mom throughout her cancer treatment for years and 8 years ago I watched her die in front of me. It's been no picnic. 

I started seeing a therapist about 10 years ago, and soon after began taking medication for depression and anxiety. Last year I was diagnosed with ADHD and started taking meds for that too. These treatments really helped, and still do. Today I have a good life; I'm married, I have wonderful friends with whom I can really open up and be myself. My support system is the best thing that ever happened to me. I got my PhD last August and have a good (not great) job. I feel like I really went through hell but came out the other side. It's great, right?

I guess all the trauma has taken its toll and now I feel like dying over the smallest of disappointments. I can't control it; it's like I never get over any frustration; they just pile up. So I find comfort in the idea that I could just end it all, even though I never act on it.

,depression,"Hello, this post is mostly for my sake. I don’t have anyone I can tell this to in real life, but I feel like I need to get this out and tell it to someone. It will be unorganized, and I apologize for that in advance.


This post talks about suicide.


I have recently returned to school after a short mid-term break. The week leading up to the break was stressful and brought me to some pretty low points, I considered it to be the peak stressor week of the term, and that if I could get past it I could finish the whole thing. Well I did it, assignments written and mid term sat. The break wasn’t good, I saw some family for the first time in a while but it wasn’t how it used to be. Thats not important. And now I’m back at school, to do it all again. 

It’s Tuesday, I told myself on Monday that I would start my assignment on Tuesday, but i didn’t, I chose to play games. I procrastinate at every opportunity. I think about what the point of doing all this is, taking the stress, when Im not even sure that I will be alive a month from now. But another part of me gets the work done, in case I am alive, so that I will have a life to go to if I don’t die. I get good grades too, A’s and B’s, but that only makes me feel bad. I imagine what i could achieve if i wasn’t so lazy, and put more work in. As the day goes by, and I waste away my time playing games out of habit in the hopes that they give me even a little bit of the joy they gave me when i was younger, the thought hits me. 

It’s a spiraling thought. ‘Im getting my work done so that i can have free time, and do the things I like’ i think to myself. But I don’t really even like it. Here i sit, a day to myself, to do what ever i want, and I still feel empty? I stress over exams and lose sleep working on assignments so that i can just feel empty? I get this though often, the thought of how pointless this all is. Normally I can shut it down before it gets bad, but I didn’t yesterday. So i sat there staring at my screen. One part of me says to just unpause the game and forget all of this until tomorrow, and the other part asking how many more days I can do this for. I close the game and shut my laptop. With this, Ive passed a point in my spiral that is hard to pull out of.

Im sure many of you have heard some form of this phrase. “I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to be here anymore”. It’s sort of cliché, but probably because it’s true. I feel this way often; I would say that less than five days a month pass without me thinking about suicide, in one form or another. I use music to calm my mind. I spend every moment I can listening to it. I’ve thought to myself multiple times about how if anything could stop me from killing myself, it would be that I wouldn’t be able to listen to my music anymore. Unfortunately a good chunk of the songs I like are, melancholic, for the lack of a better word. Ive grown accustomed to the feeling of neutrality or ‘sad’. And Ive notice that when im feeling good, i will put on these songs to bring myself back to the feelings i am more accustomed to.

After shutting my laptop, and looking at my wall for a few minutes, I put my headphones on and play my music. I fill my water bottle up, and make sure all the lights in the house are off (im in a student house. And my roommates turning the lights on lets me know that someone is out in a common space). I then go to my room, lock my door, and tie a noose onto my bed post. I haven’t tried it here before. Ive only toyed with it in my hands to see how much pressure it takes. This wont be the first time Ive attempted on my life. Not every attempt is done with the same commitment either. I don’t know if it’s my survival instinct, or if a part of me doesn’t really want to die, but Ive never been able to follow through (obviously haha). I wasn’t sure how hard I would try, but in case it worked, I pulled out a short note i had written a few weeks ago and put it on my desk. 

The post on my bed was in an awkward spot, but it’s the best spot to tie a noose in my room, and somewhere else in the house is not an option. I don’t want my friends to find me. So in a sort of crouching position, with the rope around my neck, i start to relax my feet and lean forward. This didn’t feel to different from what it was like trying to do it with the noose and my hands (not hanging on anything). But at one point, I realized I felt different. It was a feeling Ive had before, back when i was a kid and learned how to pass out (yea, dumb, i know). I felt euphoric, and out of my body. My lips were tingling and i was confused about where i was. Once the blood came back, a jolt of fear hit me and I loosened up on the rope. I felt scared. I almost killed my self while trying to kill myself (what a tool). I still stood(?) there, crouching next to my bed with the rope around my neck. I was in shock that it almost actually worked. Ive tried many times before, but only a handful were almost successful, and I always backed out. So after some time of me processing this, knowing that this might actually work, if it’s what I want, I try again. 

I for better or worse, I couldn’t get to that tingly euphoric feeling (the feeling right before you black out) to happen again. I tightened the noose, put more weight on it, but it only hurt. So I stopped. It was late, and i just wanted to go to bed at that point. I can always try again another day i thought to myself. Maybe this means im not really suicidal. But I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to be here anymore.

Now I sit here in bed writing this. Im not at risk right now. It’s late, and im tired. I made it another day. I will probably get through tomorrow too. And then Friday after that, because I like the weekends. But once the weekend passes, i do this all over again, and I wonder why. I wish it was easy to leave.

That is all.

If you took the time to read all of that I appreciate it. You don’t know me and I don’t know you, but it helps to know that someone somewhere cared.

I genuinely don't know and I think I'm about to go crazy. I want to end it all but at the same time I don't want to. 

I'm ruining everything with my own hands. 

I'm starting to do bad at school even when I'm doing my best. I also get distracted easily. I'm not even that bad, people tell me, it's just my shitty mentality that needs everything to be perfect because I used to be a straight A student back then. 

I don't have many friends and the ones I have don't fucking understand me. 

My parents try to help me but I refuse to listen, which then makes me think they're disappointed in me. They seem like that. They tell me that if I'm like this then I should stop going to school. 

People hate me out of nowhere. Maybe because I'm too cold? I don't know. Whenever I look at people having fun with friends or are in a super sweet relationship and are super easy going, I envy them a lot.

It's been so hard to even cry and whenever I do, it's just a few tears of nothing. Like the ones that are falling right now. 

I'm so envious of people. Of the ones who aren't like me, who loves their life and doesn't overthink like me. I can't take it anymore.

I genuinely can't take this shit anymore, it's been more than 2 years and I don't even know if I have some sort of depression or not.

I want to end it all but at the same time I don&amp;#39;t want to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m ruining everything with my own hands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to do bad at school even when I&amp;#39;m doing my best. I also get distracted easily. I&amp;#39;m not even that bad, people tell me, it&amp;#39;s just my shitty mentality that needs everything to be perfect because I used to be a straight A student back then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have many friends and the ones I have don&amp;#39;t fucking understand me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents try to help me but I refuse to listen, which then makes me think they&amp;#39;re disappointed in me. They seem like that. They tell me that if I&amp;#39;m like this then I should stop going to school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People hate me out of nowhere. Maybe because I&amp;#39;m too cold? I don&amp;#39;t know. Whenever I look at people having fun with friends or are in a super sweet relationship and are super easy going, I envy them a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been so hard to even cry and whenever I do, it&amp;#39;s just a few tears of nothing. Like the ones that are falling right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so envious of people. Of the ones who aren&amp;#39;t like me, who loves their life and doesn&amp;#39;t overthink like me. I can&amp;#39;t take it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely can&amp;#39;t take this shit anymore, it&amp;#39;s been more than 2 years and I don&amp;#39;t even know if I have some sort of depression or not.

,depression,"I have been diagnosed with depression and chronic anxiety since I was 11 years old. I suffered verbal and psychological abuse from my divorced parents during my childhood.

  I feel like I have lost interest in everything, and in everyone too.

 It was hard for me since I was a child to have friends, and in recent years I have been pushing my small handful of friends away from me, for any excuse or because I simply hung out with bad people.

 I have been with an abusive partner for almost two years, about 6 years older than me (I am 22) who on several occasions hit me, humiliated me, manipulated me, etc.

 I feel like I am hitting rock bottom with everything, in all areas of my life. I hide everything that happens to me.

 I have been unemployed for three months, I am about to start being a virtual girlfriend (basically an online prostitute) and for three years I have not been able to afford to pay for a therapist, but I tell everyone that I am going to avoid the rest telling me what to do. I do not go because I cannot afford it. And I have been in therapy for many years, luckily, it gave me great tools, but I feel that they are already obsolete for the problems that I face today. It is obvious anyway.

I feel very, very alone and lost. And it is something that I was able to talk about with people close to me and family, but the fucking comment of ""you have to be strong"" does not achieve anything for me.

My parents know that the idea of ​​committing suicide has been present in my life for a long time. They always relativize it. And several psychologists that I went through also know that I was never referred to a psychiatrist or they gave me any resolution to this problem. I am sure that this is also a serious error of the mental health system. I am not a stranger to psychologists and I like to know the rights of patients. Nothing is respected.

Regarding my parents, less than two weeks ago a distant cousin of mine committed suicide. She was only 15 years old. It made me very sad, because I know how hard adolescence can be. It didn't move my father at all, since shortly before she killed herself I told him again that I wanted to die.

,depression,"Idk where to even start. I just need to vent some shit here. I would usually talk to my girlfriend, but i feel like she already has enough going on and i don’t want to stress her more than she already is. 

Does anybody else ever feel this sense of impending doom? That’s the only way i can describe it. I’m so behind on all my bills. My girlfriend is going thru a really tough time and of course I’m always here for her, but now I’m feeling like I’m the one that needs help. My ex wife is a HUGE c**t. She kidnapped my son a few years ago and has since been doing everything she can to make my life as miserable as possible. She finally got a restraining order against me (after 4 tries) because the last time i picked up my son, she instigated a fight and physically pushed me, but got me on camera raising my hands in defense, which the judge saw as “too far, and putting unnecessary fear into her” so now i only get to talk to my son 3 days a week for half an hour at a time. There were so many days i came dangerously close to ending everything when she first took him. I don’t give a fuck about her, but my son is my entire world. I’ve felt so empty ever since she took him.
And when she took him, she turned EVERYBODY against me, her family (who always loved me) and my own family. Everybody sided with her and wrote letters to the judge about how unstable i am and that I’m a drug addict (cause i like to smoke weed) and am unfit to be a father. But if you ask ANYBODY else who knows me and my son, I’m the best dad in the world, and very obviously my sons favorite parent. It kills me that he’s so miserable with his mom. He’s only 8. An 8 year old should not be feeling depressed. But i understand exactly how he feels, because surprise surprise, my mom did the same thing to my dad when i was little. Took me and left my dad. I only ever got to see him twice a year. And now I’m in my dads shoes and my son is in mine and that is fucking devastating. 

My mom recently hit me up to “apologize” and tell me she has cancer…sure. All i wanted from her was for her to at least acknowledge that she fucked up when she let my step dad beat the shit out of me throughout my childhood. And for the second time, she called me a liar. I described in great detail the most memorable beatdown i got when i was about 7-8 and my step dad knocked me out but right before that i remember her screaming “you’re gonna kill him!” But he told her to shut the fuck up and she did. And then left. But apparently I’m just misremembering it… 

My exes sister also reached out recently to apologize for financing her kidnapping of my son and for not listening to my side at all. She let me know a ton of fucked up shit that my ex has been up to. Prostitution, fucking her own sisters boyfriend, and just overall being a disgusting piece of shit. It’s nice having her apologize to me but at the same time all i can think is “fuck you dude, you helped ruin my life and my son’s”. It’s just bittersweet i guess. 

But even tho everybody’s starting to see thru my exes bullshit, She still already fucked me over pretty bad. Now with this restraining order, i have to have 3 supervised visits with my son before i can bring him back home with me to visit. If you don’t know, court monitors are expensive. Not to mention the cost of driving to another state, missing however much work that takes. I feel like that’s the worst part of it. I’ve always been the best dad i could be, and even then, I’ve had my parental rights stripped from me until i can prove (again) that I’m not abusive or angry. It especially hurts to see her just living her shitty life, being a terrible mother, and still being treated like the victim all because she didn’t like me drinking or smoking, and ran around claiming she’s a DV survivor and that is have her all kinds of PTSD. But if you listen to her and watch her, you can clearly see she’s making it up. Honestly we were absolutely toxic and terrible for each other. But there was never any abuse. Unless you consider her convincing ME that I’m an angry alcohol drug addict. She even got me to go to AA and NA, which was where i really realized she was full of it. 

Because of ALL of this, I’ve been feeling pretty fucking low lately. And then to add to it, my girlfriend has been going thru a tough time, and has been having a very hard time being intimate with me. I feel bad for being upset about this, but it hurts. It makes me feel like somethings wrong with me. She says it’s not me, and i do believe her, it’s just hard not to feel that way. I’m trying to be here for her, and hold her, but it’s been a little while now, and just touching her has been making me feel even worse, like “you can touch it but you can’t have it”. Before anybody says anything about my girlfriend, she’s not the subject of this post. She makes me happier than anybody else has, and has saved my life way more times than she knows about. She’s just in a bad place mentally, and i can’t blame her, she’s been thru a lot in the past couple months. I will not leave her or step out on her because we haven’t had sex in a little while. I just felt it necessary to add this in because it’s a big part of why I’m feeling so down lately. And now it’s really just my own fault because i can’t even touch her now without getting some feelings that i can’t act on right now, and that feels bad because we both just want to cuddle and hold each other, i just can’t right now. Her skin is so soft, and she’s so fucking sexy, i can’t help but start to feel horny when we touch each other, but i don’t want to make her feel like she has to fuck me or we’re gonna have problems. I don’t want to pressure her into anything. But i really want us to be into again. And i know this won’t be forever, but it’s still bringing me down a little bit. 

How do people deal with depression? I usually smoke but I’m too broke lately to buy weed so in just going thru the motions right now trying not to lose my shit all day. I think I’ll look into therapy. There are so many things i have do but i just can’t bring myself to do anything other than mope around at home after work and talk myself out of quitting life.

,depression,"I've been depressed since like 2022 I think. I thought last year was better, it felt pretty stable though I was rarely happy. I was studying Philosophy and Japanese in college and after graduating this year I had plans to move to Japan with my boyfriend and stay here one year.

I was really unsure about it, but I put it down to just being scared as I usually am. While preparing for the move I was very stressed and felt pretty bad in general, but I thought that after arriving it would get better. And well, we came here like two weeks ago and not only did it not get better, it got like a hundred times worse.

We're in Osaka, which is a big city and I've underestimated the toll such a place could have on me - I'm from Europe and my country's big cities are like small towns compared to this. I feel trapped, all the things that seemed fascinating to me before now seem foreign and scary. I don't enjoy almost anything here, even though I was looking forward to it before. I cry everyday and my suicidal thoughts came back after being gone for one year. I miss my home, family and friends very much. I have my boyfriend's support and he tries to help, but he likes it here and doesn't really understand how I feel. I know it's hard on him as well and that makes me feel really bad. 

I try to do things everyday, go out, I even found a job and my first day is next week. I'm terrified though, I don't know if I can do it with how weak and fragile I feel all the time. I'm really scared that I'll break down during my shift or something and well, since Japan is known for its stigma around mental illness I don't know how my colleagues and boss would react. A few days ago I broke down during a get-together at our house with some friends and had to leave. I sat in a nearby park and cried on the phone to my mom for over three hours until everyone left. 

I wanna go home so bad. Almost everyone says that it's hard at first and it'll get better after I settle in but I don't know how long I should wait until that happens.

,depression,"my father has had a history with alcoholism his entire life. he grew up with family members drinking all the time. my dad has had a few moments in the past where he has had severe alcoholism, getting day drunk often. however, i noticed this usually happened after downfalls in his life. for more context, my family and i have always grown together. my dad's side of the family have also been tight but they all live in a different country.

four years ago, my uncle died from cirrhosis because he was addicted to alcohol and when his life fell apart, he turned to drinking all day and night. a few months later, my dad's mom died from a stroke. a year after, another uncle died from covid. i noticed my dad would have these depressive episodes, where after each of these tragedies happened, he would drink constantly during the day for weeks. after a while, he snapped out of it and everything was ok. he would day drink here and there from time to time, but it wasn't as bad as then.

 i will say that my parents have had CONSTANT fights when he does drink. my mom is very overdramatic and she managed to make everything worse when he would drink. she would lock him out of the house, push him, yell at him, and one time she got so mad at him she grabbed his phone and threw it so hard it completely broke? i dont understand why she's like this. she makes everything a million times worse and throws a HUGE fit when my dad drinks. even when he has a drink at a party or something, she completely flips, shames him, blames him, and becomes a big ball of anger. for the record, my dad has never done anything to harm us or put us in danger. 

eventually, my grandpa moved in with us from the motherland. everything was good but i will say my grandpa and dad would have arguments. my grandpa decided he had enough, got himself a girlfriend, and moved back home. its been a month since he left, and i dont think my dad took it well. i noticed he fell back into his old habits when family members passed away, drinking away his day, and working all exhausted at his night shifts. i think he's struggling with depression.

i tried to express concern to my mom and she immediately said she didnt care what happens to him and said that if something happens to him, it's his fault. i tried explaining to her that when someone is going through something, it's hard to really understand what your actions are and how they're affecting you. we got into an argument and i stormed off after she completely and repeatedly dismissed everything i was saying. she refuses to help. in addition, both of my parents don't believe in mental health. they believe its something totally made up.

i feel really stressed about this and while my mom is right about him being an adult, i hate to see him go through this. i just really needed to vent.

Tried to end it a couple more times after, got my life as together as I could, started going to therapy, got on medication, got into an elite school for my bachelors, escaped my abusive parents&amp;#39; household and ... here I am. Still wanting to end everything, still feeling so alone and isolated and miserable. It feels like I&amp;#39;m broken, like, fundamentally broken. Like the universe made a mistake when making me, and this horrible feeling of self hatred and sorrow is it&amp;#39;s way of correcting itself, because one day I might be successful. At this point, it feels like I&amp;#39;m only sticking around because my cat wouldn&amp;#39;t understand where I went, and why I wasn&amp;#39;t coming back. 
I&amp;#39;ve only really recently started processing the idea that life might always be like this, and that&amp;#39;s really scary, because I really don&amp;#39;t know how much longer I can live like this.

15M here.  
I want to die, but I can't bring myself to. I have a sister that cares about me and would be damaged beyond repair if I left this world behind. I have a grandma who spent so many years keeping me alive, while I was being treated of Congenital CMV, and an uncle/brother who's fighting to stay alive in the midst of suicidal thoughts. I can't leave them, but I wish I could without them missing me. Despite those people in my life, my Aunt is making my home a broken one. She doesn't understand the nature of my depression, nor does she care that I'm depressed in the first place. ""Do this or so help me God"", ""You're overreacting"", ""No one's out there to get you!"". I'm either on the edge of death or on the edge of becoming a psychopath. At this point, neither matter anymore. I don't give a shit about my future, I don't give a shit about anything but surviving. If someone points a gun at my head, I'll beg for my life, but if I try to pull that trigger myself, I stop myself before I even pick up the pistol.

,depression,"I can’t stop thinking of bad thoughts in my head. I then get upset about several things at once and I cannot focus on anything. I’m so overwhelmed in my own head that I cannot do anything actually productive. It makes me stressed, irritated, then will get angry/upset at the tiniest things. I can only realize this once I have laid down in my bed for the night, after putting the kids to bed. and only if I take thc which I only take if I have a bad day, like today. The only way I know this, is because my wife can read me. She can tell when I’m in one of depressed moods. She will give it a bit, but after 15 minutes of talking or so, she can tell that something is off with me. She’ll go “ Hey, you okay?” Because she can read me. I then tell her that I am fine and I try my best to act okay in front of her, when I really feel dead inside. Like I can’t enjoy anything, and rarely eat dinner cause I have no appetite. I will just sit there stirring the same thoughts. To try and get my mind off things,I will try to cook dinner for the family so I can temporarily clear my mind, and it works, but only some times. Most times I still can’t clear bad thoughts in my head and I just sort of go through the motions. So I will feel the absolute worst, right before they go up to bed. If one of my kids starts throwing a tantrum upstairs over something small, it makes me so upset. Like I get angry pissed off and start talking out loud to my self. Like I have to go in the basement by myself for about 15 minutes to try and calm down. But then I’ll put on YouTube again, or play a stupid ass game on my phone while watching Netflix. This is how I am when I am laid off of work, like I need to be focusing and doing actual productive things around my house, like fix up the pantry, clean the garage, do all of the laundry., dishes, garbage, get the kids ready for after school activities. But as I was thinking about the kids, the one thing that makes me happy on a bad day is putting my kids to bed. I feel so angry/exhausted until I step into each of their rooms to tuck them in. The instant I turn their door knob, they are greeted with a huge cheesy grin on my face ready to read them a book. I love making them laugh, singing fun songs about farts, making silly faces with each other. Or if it’s playing with my oldest daughter and her plushies. They’re characters from her favorite book series. Randomly at st one of my several monthly cost trips, I walked by the kids books. I grabbed a random one that looked funny, since my daughter and I have the same exact sense of humor. She had just started kindergarten, and was beginning to learn how to read. I used to read them to her every night and now she owns every book in the series. So much that I began pre-ordering the newest graphic novel months before it comes out, and we mark the date on our colander, then we rush home to read it. Once we finish the new one, we will go back to another random one in the series and read it again. The humor is so perfect and we laugh together every page. I absolutely love for those nights. She loves them so much that she remembers just about every chapter of each book, and can even recite some of the pages by heart. This is how fucked up my mind is because i just went in several different directions on why I am depressed. Then I just ramble on. Yikes. I really can’t keep my mind on one thing can I. I’m gonna put the phone down now and try and focus on this Netflix documentary while laying next to my gorgeous wife. Good night…

Never mind, my wife went to sleep and I turned on thunderstorm sounds on the tv, while blacking out the screen. We recently began doing this and we can’t sleep without it now, it’s so relaxing to sleep to. But back to being depressed, it’s bad when I’m at work also. I get by on doing the actual bare minimum required to get through the day. Like I go to the morning to speak with everyone only because I will get fired if I don’t do. That is me requirement of doing something productive. Like if I know no one is gonna be bothering me for a couple hours, I will play games on my phone or watch YouTube. Maybe crank the AC in my car and take a nap. I keep the work phone handy though cause you know, I have to answer it or else (🔥). I’m just unable to do anything cause my mind is stirring about bad thoughts, the same shit I began this rant in. I seriously need to know what is wrong with me and what I can do to get myself better. I fucking hate feeling like this and I just want to be fucking happy. I’m actually shaking and crying right now as I write this with one hand because I want to hide the screen from her so she can’t see my screen. I love her so much, she is the kindest, sweetest person on earth, and I seriously love her more and more each day. Like I honestly get more attracted to her every fucking day. We have been together since we were 16 years old, I’m not giving the exact date to remain anonymous, but I’m damn near 40. We dated since junior year of high school, and got married at 25. We moved in together before that, and had a kid after a few years. We now have 3 kids, all now in elementary school. They are my world. But when I’m depressed I know I’m not the best dad I can be, and when I’m having a good day, I absolutely kill parenting. I wake them up with jokes and tickles, pull out a new fun cereal from the store that I bought without them knowing, make em laugh with silly made up songs, get ready for the bus on time ( I will usually drive them to school on days I’m depressed because I’m moving like a snail when I have zero energy because being depressed is actually the most exhausting thing on the planet, at least in my crazy mind. I’ll go over homework and spelling test words before heading out the door with all smiles and hugs. But when I’m depressed, I have zero energy for that. Just like at work, I do the bare minimum.  I get their cereal, then I hit the couch and look at my sports teams stats or something, or ya know, doom scroll on this damn website. I’ll still get them to school but I’m like a servant. I can’t have fun on these days. I feel stuck in these stupid bad thoughts in my head and I get angry/irritated with even the simplest thing. My head is starting to spin again and I need to end this and hope to fall asleep. I have so much more to get off my chest but I don’t know when I’ll be able to find the right mind space to continue, hopefully I can again tomorrow.

I then get upset about several things at once and I cannot focus on anything. I’m so overwhelmed in my own head that I cannot do anything actually productive. It makes me stressed, irritated, then will get angry/upset at the tiniest things. I can only realize this once I have laid down in my bed for the night, after putting the kids to bed. and only if I take thc which I only take if I have a bad day, like today. The only way I know this, is because my wife can read me. She can tell when I’m in one of depressed moods. She will give it a bit, but after 15 minutes of talking or so, she can tell that something is off with me. She’ll go “ Hey, you okay?” Because she can read me. I then tell her that I am fine and I try my best to act okay in front of her, when I really feel dead inside. Like I can’t enjoy anything, and rarely eat dinner cause I have no appetite. I will just sit there stirring the same thoughts. To try and get my mind off things,I will try to cook dinner for the family so I can temporarily clear my mind, and it works, but only some times. Most times I still can’t clear bad thoughts in my head and I just sort of go through the motions. So I will feel the absolute worst, right before they go up to bed. If one of my kids starts throwing a tantrum upstairs over something small, it makes me so upset. Like I get angry pissed off and start talking out loud to my self. Like I have to go in the basement by myself for about 15 minutes to try and calm down. But then I’ll put on YouTube again, or play a stupid ass game on my phone while watching Netflix. This is how I am when I am laid off of work, like I need to be focusing and doing actual productive things around my house, like fix up the pantry, clean the garage, do all of the laundry., dishes, garbage, get the kids ready for after school activities. But as I was thinking about the kids, the one thing that makes me happy on a bad day is putting my kids to bed. I feel so angry/exhausted until I step into each of their rooms to tuck them in. The instant I turn their door knob, they are greeted with a huge cheesy grin on my face ready to read them a book. I love making them laugh, singing fun songs about farts, making silly faces with each other. Or if it’s playing with my oldest daughter and her plushies. They’re characters from her favorite book series. Randomly at st one of my several monthly cost trips, I walked by the kids books. I grabbed a random one that looked funny, since my daughter and I have the same exact sense of humor. She had just started kindergarten, and was beginning to learn how to read. I used to read them to her every night and now she owns every book in the series. So much that I began pre-ordering the newest graphic novel months before it comes out, and we mark the date on our colander, then we rush home to read it. Once we finish the new one, we will go back to another random one in the series and read it again. The humor is so perfect and we laugh together every page. I absolutely love for those nights. She loves them so much that she remembers just about every chapter of each book, and can even recite some of the pages by heart. This is how fucked up my mind is because i just went in several different directions on why I am depressed. Then I just ramble on. Yikes. I really can’t keep my mind on one thing can I. I’m gonna put the phone down now and try and focus on this Netflix documentary while laying next to my gorgeous wife. Good night…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never mind, my wife went to sleep and I turned on thunderstorm sounds on the tv, while blacking out the screen. We recently began doing this and we can’t sleep without it now, it’s so relaxing to sleep to. But back to being depressed, it’s bad when I’m at work also. I get by on doing the actual bare minimum required to get through the day. Like I go to the morning to speak with everyone only because I will get fired if I don’t do. That is me requirement of doing something productive. Like if I know no one is gonna be bothering me for a couple hours, I will play games on my phone or watch YouTube. Maybe crank the AC in my car and take a nap. I keep the work phone handy though cause you know, I have to answer it or else (🔥). I’m just unable to do anything cause my mind is stirring about bad thoughts, the same shit I began this rant in. I seriously need to know what is wrong with me and what I can do to get myself better. I fucking hate feeling like this and I just want to be fucking happy. I’m actually shaking and crying right now as I write this with one hand because I want to hide the screen from her so she can’t see my screen. I love her so much, she is the kindest, sweetest person on earth, and I seriously love her more and more each day. Like I honestly get more attracted to her every fucking day. We have been together since we were 16 years old, I’m not giving the exact date to remain anonymous, but I’m damn near 40. We dated since junior year of high school, and got married at 25. We moved in together before that, and had a kid after a few years. We now have 3 kids, all now in elementary school. They are my world.

It’s unbearable, I have no friends. I’m 24 and it seems impossible to meet people or try to make friends. It used to be so easy for me to make friends when I was only a few years younger. 

Now? It’s insanity. I don’t like social media (never have) as I find it to be very unhealthy and just too toxic to justify really having. Aside from reddit and YouTube, they are the only social media platforms that I have, but I don’t really do much on reddit. 

I just want to meet people and have friends, talk about things I like with them, meet people with common beliefs and common interests. 

I stick out like a sore thumb no matter where I go. I don’t feel like I belong anywhere, I feel like I’m trying to head to a home that doesn’t exist. 

I’ve seen so many therapists and been on meds before (currently seeing a therapist) but none of it helps. I admitted myself to a hospital not too long ago out of desperation to try and find a purpose in my life. Biggest mistake. I lost 5,000$ and I now have slight PTSD from that horrible place. 

I hate my job which is its own can of worms. I’ve come to basically accept that I’ll never have someone who loves me. As I am a virgin and feel completely alienated by people around me who are all married. (Doesn’t help the self esteem at all). 

Even when I go to church I feel so out of place and purposeless. I’m “not fun” according to my co workers because I don’t drink or do drugs, as they both scare me because I have an addictive personality. 

I cut myself every now and then because of my misery that has turned to hate. Hate for myself and the world. 

I hate that the world would rather point and laugh and say such things as “Edgy” “Incel” “grow up” etc etc. 

Despite the fact that I worked hard and stayed on the straight path, didn’t get into trouble, was always nice to people, didn’t cheat people or screw others over. I just worked and wanted nothing but friends and a family. Well I guess that’s just too much to ask.

The loneliness I'm feeling —even tho I have one or two emotional pillars— is slowly but surely eating me from inside.
Depression makes every single thing feel like a task, so naturally I am barely active in life in general, I sometimes enjoy my hobbies (music production, editorial make-up, writing, and drawing) but since the last two years they just seem like a task too... My family is a big mess with a very destructive history; dad is violent and abusive and won't leave even if this is my mom's house, while my mom is very passive (naturally, from being scared of him all her life). I do have two older brothers but they're either totally oblivious to this or they cowardly run away from every fight that I have with my dad. My family is not proud of me for wasting my youth but I'm not proud of them for making my childhood, teenage years and now my adulthood HELL ON EARTH. I've been fighting for my mother since I was just a kid and this finally burnt my brain to ashes. It BURNT my brain I feel lifeless and everything hurts :/

I'm (apparently) an active and cheerful person on social media so I manage to make friends every so often but as nice as they seem at first, I eventually notice they either don't care about me or have secondary intentions (I'm gay, ftr, gay dudes can be total scoundrels) and I decide to cut them off.
I also suffered from bullying from 1st to 9th grade, till I finally decided to go to continuation school (right after 9th grade) to evade bullies and comments like ""Kill yourself you f*cking weirdo"". I actually made it in 2 years with an average of 9.8 (in México it's 1-10), because studying was never an issue, it was people, but from there I spiralized to this state of nothingness...

It has been like that for like 4 years and I never went to university. I did want to study music or art but I just... didn't. I couldn't. I've been rotting for so many years while experiencing hell with my family for years now bc I didn't have time nor motivation.
The only things keeping me alive are addictions (like sex, porn or cigarettes) which lead to pretty bad health issues (I'm currently aching, I want to love my body but I'm sick of feeling sick or ugly),
And my mother. My mother is the only reason I didn't do it, the only reason I'm still here, stuck, trying to fight for her. She used to be very mean but she became my only friend in the entire world when I was a teen. I cannot leave her alone or she'll unalive herself too, she's just as depressive as me

""I need to save you, but who's going to save me?"" Is a lyric that resonates with me every single day of my life. I want to die, but I don't want to, but I do. Does someone feel like this too? :(

I actually made it in 2 years with an average of 9.8 (in México it&amp;#39;s 1-10), because studying was never an issue, it was people, but from there I spiralized to this state of nothingness...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been like that for like 4 years and I never went to university. I did want to study music or art but I just... didn&amp;#39;t. I couldn&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ve been rotting for so many years while experiencing hell with my family for years now bc I didn&amp;#39;t have time nor motivation.
The only things keeping me alive are addictions (like sex, porn or cigarettes) which lead to pretty bad health issues (I&amp;#39;m currently aching, I want to love my body but I&amp;#39;m sick of feeling sick or ugly),
And my mother. My mother is the only reason I didn&amp;#39;t do it, the only reason I&amp;#39;m still here, stuck, trying to fight for her. She used to be very mean but she became my only friend in the entire world when I was a teen. I cannot leave her alone or she&amp;#39;ll unalive herself too, she&amp;#39;s just as depressive as me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I need to save you, but who&amp;#39;s going to save me?&amp;quot; Is a lyric that resonates with me every single day of my life. I want to die, but I don&amp;#39;t want to, but I do. Does someone feel like this too? :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for making this a whole therapy session for anyone who might have read all of this. And I sincerely thank you if you did. If you&amp;#39;re also looking for friends... a reason, a motive, someone who won&amp;#39;t judge you,  then please reach out, we can follow each other and help us if we get &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; urge. I also apologize if my english is poor! :s&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"so i've been ""depressed"" since literally before i can remember..i never really had a chance, anyways ive literally screamed for help so many times and nobody wants to save me from this.

i was 12 when quarantine started, im almost 17 now, and that's when things totally got fucked, i started smoking cigs and weed (snorting random shit) the whole way up until like last month? 

even prior to this everything was still hell. i had no friends throughout elementary school. I was the reason no birthday invitations were sent out in class(so they didn't have to invite me) . I had one birthday party and invited two people in elementary school, they were mean to me the whole time. everyday at recess i would just walk in circles unless someone i knew wasn't talking to their other friends. i was weird and ugly so that may explain it. 

6th and 8th grade (when i was in real school) I didn't really have any friends either, a few people but a common theme was I was never like them, and I didn't belong. I don't remember much of sixth grade. eighth grade I got kicked out of my lunch table because I was the one everyone liked the least and it was assigned seating. my best friend i ever had told my other friends not to save me a seat. After that, I had to sit with my childhood friend and she was kind of emo nothing against that but I became friends with this other girl who became my best friend, we ended up smoking together, she got caught and told everyone I drugged her. I didn't. It was her money, my plug. our choice. She said I forced her to smoke cigs.. I literally never encouraged that because I knew how bad it was. 

anyways, summer after eighth grade into freshman year  I was a total alcoholic. I drank to get black out almost every time I hung out with my friends.. I drank by myself. I drank on pills. And said friends from the original lunch table,  my bff ended up, dropping me. So then our other three friends, never talk to me again besides one. At the end of freshman year, she never said a word to me again. 

10th grade . I had a boyfriend he only wanted me because I'm such an easy target and he knew I was easy and lonely. He was so mean to me every day. I ended up breaking up with him then  nobody. after that, I had some friends for a while because this girl approached me and adopted me into her group, she got me in trouble with the school shortly later. we were still friends after that but after summer, she never talk to me again and none of the other people from the group did either.

I'm a junior now, I'm sober, and the worst I've ever been. LOL I failed every single class last year because of my attendance. I got bad grades freshman year and I probably will this year too. 

Will I ever get a chance? How can I give myself a chance?

I’m in a really difficult place right now and feeling incredibly isolated. I’ve been struggling with severe anxiety for a long time, and it feels like it’s getting worse, especially when I’m around people. I constantly feel like I’m being watched or judged, and it’s exhausting.

I’ve had some traumatic experiences, and these have left me feeling emotionally drained and fearful. One of the most difficult things for me is the feeling that I’m disconnected from everyone around me. It feels like I don’t belong anywhere, and this loneliness is overwhelming.

I also struggle with intrusive thoughts and often feel like people don’t want me around, or that I’m somehow “guilty” for things I haven’t done. This has made it really hard for me to trust others or build meaningful connections. Even though I’ve tried to reach out in the past, I’m terrified of being misunderstood or rejected.

I’m hoping to connect with people who might understand what I’m going through, or who have faced similar struggles. I really just need someone to talk to, even if it’s just to feel like I’m not so alone. If anyone out there has felt similarly or has advice, I would love to hear from you.

,depression,"**Hi all.** I’m a landscape and wildlife photographer, but what most people don’t know is that I’ve been battling with depression for as long as I can remember. There are days when the darkness feels suffocating, when even the simple act of getting out of bed feels impossible. On those days, it feels like the weight of the world is pressing down on my chest, and I can’t breathe, let alone create.

Photography is my lifeline. When everything feels like it’s falling apart, being in nature with my camera is the only thing that brings me peace. There’s something about capturing the beauty of a quiet moment—a sunrise creeping through the trees, the stillness in the eyes of an animal—that helps me remember that there’s still light in the world, even when I can’t feel it inside. But here’s the truth: even in those moments of beauty, the darkness never really leaves. It lingers, hovering at the edge of my mind, waiting for the quiet to settle back in.

There are days when I don’t want to pick up the camera. When the thought of creating something feels pointless because it doesn’t make the pain go away. But I push myself. I force myself out there because, in those fleeting moments, I feel alive. I feel connected to something bigger than the emptiness inside me. And sometimes, that’s enough to keep me going for another day.

I don’t have all the answers. I still struggle more often than not. But I wanted to share this because I know there are others out there feeling the same. The weight, the exhaustion, the loneliness. Maybe by sharing, we can feel a little less alone in this fight.

I recently got out of a mental health facility with my first diagnosis ever in 30 years.

,depression,"My mother just turned 60 and she has been dealing with major depression disorder for a little less than a year now. It all started when she didn't show up for work one morning and her boss sent a wellness check to her house - she was laying in bed having an anxiety attack saying that she couldn't handle getting up and going to work. She was consequently admitted into the hospital and evaluated and ultimately diagnosed with MDD with psychosis. She spent a few days there and then ended up going back home.

Weeks went by and she really wasn't getting any better. She stopped eating and washing, taking care of the dogs, etc. In fact, she was spending a majority of her day just rotting in bed, wearing the same clothes that she wore the day prior that she ended up falling asleep in (sometimes even in jeans and sneakers). So, we had her admitted into the hospital again, this time a mental hospital. She spent weeks there, complaining about how awful it was, but still not eating or really doing anything it seemed to try and get better. She ended up losing about 60 lbs over this period.

Fast forward a bit, and she's back home and again on a decline. She lives alone but my sibling and I (both late 20s) check on her periodically to make sure she is taking care of herself. However, over the past \~6 weeks we've found that if we do not FORCE her to get up, shower, go to the grocery store and buy food, she will literally rot in bed and will not eat, will not let the dogs out or walk them, etc.

She is on disability payments but they barely cover her rent and don't cover her other bills which she admits she is simply putting off. She is in weekly therapy which she claims doesn't work. She is on a variety of behavioral medications which she claims don't work (we're unsure if she even takes them regularly). She has shown no desire to go back to work and when we try to tell her that she needs to figure out a plan to get back to work and making an income, she just responds ""I know"" or ""I don't know what to do"".

How do we care for our mother who literally refuses to help herself? We try to come at her with kindness and she doesn't open up; try and come at her with assertion and she again does not open up or provide any context as to what she's going through.

It's getting to the point where my sibling and I are distracted at work and hindered from living our own lives because our 60-year old mother won't take care of herself. We've been discussing a relocation to some sort of assisted living program or hiring her a full-time aide, but we're not sure how payments for that would work and she obviously has no income.

Completely. I've never felt so low in my entire life. I've cried more than I have in years. Ever since I was a teen I wanted to be a musician, a rockstar, a producer. Moving to LA seemed like my chance, my future. All my life the only option I ever saw for myself was music. If I can't live in LA and have a music career, it feels like I'm a loser, a nobody, I have no future and ultimately life is meaningless and there's no point to even live. There's nothing else I want to do, feel passionate about or see a future in. And now it's all being stripped away.

I don't know how to even go on. Every fucking day is a waking nightmare. Anxiety attacks, feeling completely out of control, like the floor could fall and swallow me into a bottomless void at any second. Suicidal ideation, crying, absolute hopelessness, dread and despair. Can't just lay in bed all day because the morning anxiety is too much and I have to get up, yet I can't stand sitting around my apartment because the anxiety eats me up regardless. I live alone and the loneliness is destroying me.

I still have love for LA and want to be here, but I am so broken and isolated that I've made the heart wrenching decision to move back in with my parents in Ohio. It feels like I'm giving up on life.

I'm too weak to achieve my goals. Just another dreamer chewed up and spit out of LA. If I can't make it here I can't make it anywhere.

I'm trying to see moving back in with my parents as a chance to regroup, work on my mental health, to save money to actually give myself a chance at a future.

,depression,"As per the title, I am currently working up the courage to reach out to my friends to ask them for help in this journey. I've been dealing with depression on and off for a big portion of my life, but over the past few months it has gotten significantly worse due to a mix of burn out, health issues, and bad incidents. I've stopped going out altogether, can barely make it out of bed, and most tasks feel like a chore--all of which are my telltale signs of 'this is bad, I need help'. I am in therapy already, but it's been difficult regardless.

Tomorrow I will get together with one of my friends, one who is very kind and empathetic, and I will work out with her what I want to say exactly. Having her outside perspective will help me in making sure I tell them everything that may be relevant (I have a tendency to hide my problems) and will give me that final push to talk to everyone else. I know I want to mention to them a bit about my struggles (they know what's been going on, I've just been hiding its impact on my wellbeing), I want to say that our friendship means a lot and that's why I want to share this with them (I've really neglected my friends these past few weeks and I hate that I did), that I need a bit of help for a while (more specifically, I need them to drag me out of the house every so often), but also that they don't need to feel fully responsible for me, just help when they can. 

I think this is a good idea because I have tried to weather the storm on my own and it's not working. Last time I was feeling this low I had a couple of friends who would just randomly show up on my doorstep and would not leave, no matter how annoyed I would get. So I think I may need again that kind of ""annoying"" love (it was really sweet, even if at the time it drove me insane) and it's surely better to ask my friends directly rather than wait for them to just randomly come up with the idea on their own.

I guess the hang up I have left is that I hate feeling like a burden on anyone. I feel like a little child having to ask my friends to drag me out of the house. They should not have to be worried for me. I should be able to cope with life just like everyone else. But I know all of that is the little demon inside of me trying to drag me down.

,depression,"I feel Numb. Something inside of my mind wants to interact with other people, but most of my mind thinks that this something is a fool.
How do you even Interact and have fun? How do you actually feel the feeling of friendship without having a chosen addictive activity?
What is love? Baby don‘t hurt me?
How do you laugh at something from your heart, and not because it is specifically your cup of humor.
How do you have fun?
I like talk and act honest to people, (because a Facade takes too much energy, and when people notice, it’s just even more awkward)
but this sentence could also be „I like to turn into thin air or a twig in front of people“ because that is how I feel.
I can objectively tell if I am interested in something, but when it comes to the act of actually CARING(Doing the smallest stuff for/because). I stop.
My explanation for this is:
I don’t have energy = I don‘t have fun = I don‘t have strong feelings = I don‘t have energy = I don‘t care.
I don‘t know what to talk about, and I cannot ask all of those „Wow tell me more“ questions, It‘s like I am in third person, the same when complimenting.
There is nothing in me that tells me „You feel like you want to ask, you feel like you want to tell, you feel like you want to know“
So when asking or telling, I‘m just monotone, cause for me that‘s honest, and asking, would seem unauthentic, cause I don‘t mean it by heart. I just feel so disconnected, like there can only be a list of things „Me“ cares about if I try, not a list of things I care about.
Since I met this person, I‘ve dug a long rabbit hole into my own thoughts and explanations for my being. Because I‘ve lacked genuine interaction… With people, and things in general over the past 8 years. They only now made me realize and think deeper of who I am.
I feel like Objectively, they are a Person I could vibe with, if I had genuine interest in them or anything, but I can‘t force it.
And this is where my mind explodes. 
I WANT to feel the feeling of friendship, and fun, and love, and whatever else there is that is a feeling you feel when you‘re happy or comfortable.
But as I said, I CAN’T, I just can‘t tap into this state of existence, I just do not Care, not from heart. I just don‘t feel excited when I know I‘m meeting up, it feels like knowing I‘ll need to wash dishes.
I feel bad, and I also think about telling them. But since I‘ve discovered how my depression shows outside, I believe I will hurt someone.
And it‘s not like I talked to them first. So someone talks to me, gets to know me, finds out I feel like shit, and then is either disappointed or becomes depressed themselves while trying to help me hopelessly.

Also, how does one react when someone says

„You‘re interesting, but I don‘t care for you, actually I care about no one, but I want a friendship, but I don‘t have a basis for a friendship“
I‘d probably say goodbye to that someone.

And then, when they do, I‘ve lost my chance.

What can I do, I‘m now 17 and for the last 8 years of my life, I had the same old Friendgroup which never met often, and 3 of these I was just at home, in front of my desired digital device.
So, I don‘t have Life experience, not at all.
Friendships or other relationships don‘t make sense to me, I don‘t even feel like I care for my parents or siblings.

If I were tapped into existence, I‘d probably admire this person. And rn I know I would like to feel feelings with them instead with someone else or worse, BUT HOW?!
Im 17, I don‘t want to sit on this planet if I don’t even know what love, passion and fun feel like!!

Tldr;
I suspect I have depression due to a lack of Life experience in combination with feelings.
I‘ve given up on the Idea of making friends because I lack a basis.
I don‘t look like it, and someone that is like 13 times more alive and interesting/cooler than me started talking to me, enduring my coldness.
I don‘t feel a sense of friendship or fun or anything around them, but I desperately want to, but I don‘t know how to act without a feeling because that would just be unauthentic.
HELLLPPPP?!

,depression,"  Im 18m graduated high school in june and am taking time off so dont have a job. I feel like i dont have friends sometims, no one ever texts first, i always have to initiate the conversation. They all say people are busy, likei get that but you still have time to start a conversation, and a bunch of them told me i should get a job, that will make me happier, i feel like thats so stupid, how is getting a job gonna make me happier or make my mental health better when lots of people find having a job depressing as fuck? 

  I cant seem to get into a relationship either, i feel like it might be my social skills, like i fibd making conversation hard and im nor the funniest, i am fat, but i can change that, but even tho that i can change, i cant change having a 3 inch erect penis that is less than an inch soft. I want a relationship so badly but i always hear mens stories about women they get with reacting negativly and leaving or making fun of it. I dont want to be settled for either. I feel so shitty about it like no one will want me for it. I read people say that size doesnt matter if they fall in love with your personality, what personality? Im not funny, charismatic and i cant make conversation, i dont have any goals in life and even if i did thats limited by another factor ill talk about after. The only thing i want to do with my life is travel the world and find ancient lost treausre, but thats not very realistic now is it? Lol.

  The other factors that make me really feel shitty about my self and my potential love life is the fact that my eyesight is legally so bad that i can never drive a car and my condition cannot be treated because its caused by my genes, i could possibly go blind, i may not tho. With my genes comes disfigured fingers as well;( because of my eyesight my job oppertunities are also limited. I dont know what the point of living is if i lose my sight. All my favorite things need sight to do, video games, movies, tv, pool. I know i would become very depressed if i lost my sight.

  Now this is a genuine question, who woould even want to date someone with all these things wrong with them? I feel so lonely and want someone by my side but then i realize im simply inferior and theres nothing i can do about it, so i start doubting someone will ever truly want me and be attracted to me.

  Sonetimes i think of suicide even tho i would never do it because im too afraid of death, so afraid that it can keep me from sleeping as im afraid ill die in my sleep. Maybe if i knew reincarnation was completely real i would kill myself

I don’t know what to do because nothing I’m doing seems to work. I’m not a bad person but I keep thinking I’ve done something terrible and that I’m being punished in some way, as silly as that is. But I just feel so lost right now that I can only blame someone else for the situation I’ve put myself into. I really don’t know what to do now. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"A part of the reason I wanted to make this post was to share my story, but another part of it was to help other people my age in similar situations. I understand that I have it very easy and that my depression story is probably not as intense as others, but my depression is real and even if I help only one person with this, it would make my world.

When I was 15 I had been struggling with weight gain. The weight gain was mostly due to binge eating, but at the time I had put all the blame onto my antidepressants. With this concern, I got a psychiatrist. This psychiatrist suggested that I taper off of my current antidepressants in order to start a new one that didn't have the side effects of weight gain. Long story short, he tapered me off too fast. This abrupt change caused me to feel nothing but dread. I couldn't recognize myself anymore and I didn't feel alive in the slightest. This made me abruptly suicidal and I was sent to the mental hospital.

After the mental hospital, they quickly put me back onto my original medication. Despite being back on my medication, I barely felt a change. It took me 2 years to slowly begin to feel like I had in the past. It was hell. I would feel like killing myself every single fucking night for a year. I would dissociate and feel like my life was pointless. The reason it took me as long as it did to start to feel like myself again was because I had such a pessimistic outlook, that I couldn't get back on my feet.

I was 15, depressed, suicidal, and giving up on everything. Now I am 17 and I feel alive. I have friends by my side who love and support me. I also have a girlfriend who is my whole world. I just got into my top choice college and I also just got a paid internship in electrical engineering. I've had problems for years with seasonal depression, but ever since the air started getting chillier and it's gotten darker, I've not felt a thing.

I am making this post to share the things that have helped me overcome depression and become who I am today.

Keep yourself busy:
This is probably my biggest advice when it comes to breaking out of depression. I used to think that the more free-time I had at home playing video games and watching TV, the better. None of that is true, at least not for me. I found that the more I got out and kept myself busy, whether it be running errands or going to the gym, the better I felt. It gave me the sense that I really do have more control over my life than I thought I did.

Get your body moving:
This was something I thought was absolute bullshit for the majority of these 2 years, but it did magic for me. There was so many times I tried to get active but I couldn't because I thought that if I didn't feel a change in a few weeks, it was pointless and nothing was working. The key is that you have to shut that part of your brain out and just keep going. I would have days where I was like, ""I don't feel like working out, I could probably just stay at home."" But then I would shut that little voice out and I would realize that there was nothing stopping me from getting dressed and going to the gym. I realized that I could just Do It.

Stop listening to pessimism:
This was probably the hardest thing for me. The pessimism could either come from other people or yourself. In my personal experience, my brain would trick me into thinking I was never really happy, therefore I would never get better. It's bullshit. Do not listen to your brain. The other part of this is extremely depressed and extremely pessimistic people. This is absurdly common specifically on mental health subreddits. The amount of stuff I saw from people talking about how ""it never gets better"" is just absolute fucking garbage. They will come on here and spew this negativity like it's a fact. But it's not a fact. As soon as you shut these people out of your head, you realize that life DOES get better.

I have more to say probably, but those are the key things that helped me get to the point I'm at now.

,depression,"Hello, my name is Valentin, I'm nearly 24 and I feel like I'm wasting my life because of this problem.

Quite simply, I feel like an alien in the eyes of others (family, friends, colleagues). I notice it quite easily in the looks on their faces when I speak and in the ""yea good 🙂"" answers I sometimes get.

To be honest, I've been pretty reserved since high school and I think it shows no matter what I try to do. I find it really hard to speak up, especially in large groups or in noisy environments.

I also really feel like I'm not normal in appearance, maybe in body language or facial expressions, but I feel weird myself and never at ease...
Since last year, I've been trying to improve my appearance, thinking it would make me a bit more sociable, but it's no use, I don't fit in at all. Maybe I'm just uptight or don't know how to have fun. I'd so much rather enjoy life, make friends, go out and just be happy :/.

I just don't understand why I'm so different from other people and why they look at me like that. Solving this problem would make me so happy.

,depression,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

I’m going to put a TW here just because there are some mentions that might trigger people eg, sa, ed, suicide. 

Basically for most of my life I’ve had anxiety well assumed anxiety like I left school at 13-14 years old, can barely talk to people in person or on the phone, overthink everything and can’t even hold a conversation. But to be honest I don’t even know what’s wrong with me, there is definitely something wrong with me. Like here’s some examples.

I can’t sleep in my bed if it’s under the blanket I have to sleep on the blanket with another blanket on top because if my bed isn’t made it triggers my anxiety like to the point of meltdown I wanna cry if it isn’t made.

I work in a primary school as a cleaner and sometimes I’ll play games with the students who are teachers kids while they wait for their parents and then randomly in the back of my head it will just be saying stuff like “eww I bet you like kids” and stuff it’s really weird and fucked. (I think I might be a victim of cocsa but whenever I think about it I have a panic attack and whenever I want to tell someone I convince myself that’s not what it was because my 10 year old self was convinced it was a normal fun game that kids play (it wasn’t)) 

This one’s weird but I have to wear socks otherwise I can’t leave my room, but I can’t wear socks to bed otherwise I get really uncomfortable. This might just be a preference but.

Whenever a minor inconvenience happens like example me overhearing my mom and sister talking about me, my first reaction is to end my own life, I’m afraid that I’m going to actually do it one day because it just overwhelms my brain every time anything happens. 
My internal monologue also is always repeating “you should just kill yourself” almost every day if not multiple times a day.

My I guess anxiety convinces me of things that I don’t even agree on, examples; i love my boyfriend so much, like I wanna marry the guy but every couple of hours my brain is like “you don’t actually love him, you’re gonna hurt him” and stuff like telling myself that I actually don’t have any feelings for him and that I’m just convincing myself I do which isn’t true because I really fucking like him. Another example would be things like tattoos and piercings, I feel instant regret even if it’s a tattoo I’ve wanted and thought on for years my mind is instantly like “that was stupid and now you have it forever you dumb bitch” 

I also think I might have some form of eating disorder but I also tell myself I shouldn’t tell anyone about that either because it’s not “bad enough” to seek help. But I overthink every bit of food I eat and when I’m around people I avoid eating all together, I don’t care if they eat but it makes me feel sick to even think about eating in front of people. 

My deodorants and body sprays have to be in order from tallest to smallest otherwise I don’t have them sit on my desk at all. 

I also have like semi severe fear of germs aswell. And go thru cycles of either showering everyday if not twice to not showering at all. And same for washing my hands, I’ll either wash them with soap twice after using the bathroom or not at all (which is gross I know)

,depression,"My friend has suffered from anxiety and depression for years. It has ebbed and flowed but she’s had a pretty awful last 18 months or so and I’m just wondering about how and what I can do to support her and appreciate any advice.
I’ve known her for about two years; in that time she’s had to deal with the end of her marriage; and the loss of two dogs that were incredibly important to her. She’s also had a couple of really cruddy jobs.

I had gently suggested counseling and possibly talking to a doc about anti depressants; but she didn’t think she could afford counseling and was pretty resistant to antidepressants in general. Finally recently she learned her insurance WOULD cover counseling; and she also decided to go on an anti-depressant.

So she’s been on them for a week and she knows it might take a month or two for them to really be effective. This past week she’s done well on some days and not well on others.

My question is how can I support her without overwhelming her, or accidentally making her feel worse? We probably see each other once or twice a week; and we text several times a day. We talk about her struggles often so many of my texts are querying how she’s feeling, can I do anything for her, etc.

She always answers and doesn’t seem hugely annoyed (I honestly would get annoyed with some asking my how I was doing all the time but my sense is she appreciates it)

I often offer to drop by with soup, or to bring a doggie by for a visit or other stuff; except for when she had COVID a year ago she’s never once taken me up on the offer.

I asked her once—and she agreed—to call me if she ever finds herself in a dark place where she is thinking about “final thoughts.”

So I’m just asking if the way I am dealing with her is helpful, unintentionally hurtful, or somewhere in between. And are there other things I can do to support her?

For info she’s about 45; no siblings or cousins; a fairly toxic relationship with her parents who live across the country; several friends (I’m one of her closest; or at least I think I'm the one she feels most comfortable talking about this stuff.

It has ebbed and flowed but she’s had a pretty awful last 18 months or so and I’m just wondering about how and what I can do to support her and appreciate any advice.
I’ve known her for about two years; in that time she’s had to deal with the end of her marriage; and the loss of two dogs that were incredibly important to her. She’s also had a couple of really cruddy jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had gently suggested counseling and possibly talking to a doc about anti depressants; but she didn’t think she could afford counseling and was pretty resistant to antidepressants in general. Finally recently she learned her insurance WOULD cover counseling; and she also decided to go on an anti-depressant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So she’s been on them for a week and she knows it might take a month or two for them to really be effective. This past week she’s done well on some days and not well on others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is how can I support her without overwhelming her, or accidentally making her feel worse? We probably see each other once or twice a week; and we text several times a day. We talk about her struggles often so many of my texts are querying how she’s feeling, can I do anything for her, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She always answers and doesn’t seem hugely annoyed (I honestly would get annoyed with some asking my how I was doing all the time but my sense is she appreciates it)&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi guys, 

Thought id make a post about this because I just don't know anymore, and I thought maybe someone here can relate to me and maybe give me some pointers. And who knows, maybe this can help someone as well who is struggling. 

I should also mention I do have diagnosed Dyspraxia, and I do struggle with anxiety on pretty much a daily basis.

I have been struggling with down feelings on and off since 2017 (for context around 13 yrs old in 2017). Since then I have been dealing with feelings of people not liking me, are just sticking up to me, fearing that I'm saying the wrong things, needing constant reassurance, being so anxious about stupid situations etc... 

Whenever I've tried to open up to people, they ALWAYS treat me different afterwards, making me feel so alone and just, crazy. Therefore I've kept the darker element of my thought pattern to myself. Thankfully my parents have been of great support, but there's only so much I can tell them without them getting really worried. And the problem is, when emotions build up like that, they need a release. I slam doors, bottles, obviously getting in trouble with the parents etc!...

Truth is, I do question sometimes, why am I here? What's my purpose? Why am I the one left out? What am I doing so wrong that people around me are flourishing, have great friends, great relationships, and I can't get that. I try to communicate with people, but there's always some sort of wall that prevents me from truly linking with someone. I just want someone that understands me and wont belittle me or exclude me because I wear my emotions on my sleave.

I also deal with lack of motivation. I am a college student so I'm expected to be on my A game. But this year, I just don't have the energy to get it done properly and to the best of my abilities. I feel that I'm a bad student, people are getting chosen for jobs and I'm not, I just feel so stupid.

I describe my mood as a roller coaster, some days I'm so happy, every one of my problems just mellow out, Then others, my problem envelope me and make me so down and lacking any sort of self belief and motivation. (Keep in mind even when I'm happy, my self confidence can be very wobbly).  

And when I want to cry, I just can't, maybe a tear or two if lucky, but never crying fully.

I feel there's more I want to say about my experiences, but right now my mind is so noisy, I can't get all my thoughts typed.

,depression,"Hi everyone,

My boyfriend of almost two years has been in a pretty bad “slump” since the beginning of the summer. It started with him saying he was questioning our relationship but he really didn’t like it and it scared him. Then it progressed into him not feeling affection for me or his friends and family. Now, he is just a shell and he’s been officially diagnosed with depression. I have been encouraging him to get therapy and medication and he has been doing very well with that, getting the help he needs. He’s been in therapy for about a month and he just started medication. 

This is the problem. 

I’ve been there for him every step of the way, being his cheerleader and support through it all. I tell him that his depression isn’t him, he’ll pull through, that he’s worthy of love etc. However, his depression has affected his ability to be affectionate. This is REALLY affecting me. I can handle all of his remarks and moods, as I’ve dealt with major depression before and am on medication for it myself. But what I can’t handle is him constantly pushing me away and rejecting my affection for him. Last night he told me that he “doesn’t want me to act like he’s the love of my life” and to stop “acting like I’m transcending love” with him. This hurts, mainly because I’m trying to be so strong and act like everything is okay with me. But also, it’s just my natural reaction to being with him. So I’m trying to tune down the fact that I love him?? It’s difficult. 

I’m hoping and praying he gets better, for his sake mainly, but for my sake too. His behavior has made me start going into negative thought patterns about how nobody loves me and I give all this love and don’t get anything in return. I know this is my depression talking though. I just feel like I don’t have the coping skills to deal with what he’s going through now. I’m tired of feeling selfish for having feelings too.

In school I didn’t really dwell on it because people enjoyed my company and the things I would say, because I was known as a funny, dumb and spurr of the moment kind of person. Now I am out of school 2 years and I just fucking hate my existence. I’m actually a fool.

I don’t have any direction I want to take in life, I just go to work come home droop in bed for the rest of the day then do it all again. I am fully aware that’s not what I should be doing and I actually made a daily routine I should follow but haven’t even started trying it once. 
I know exactly what I have to do but really I don’t care about following it. And that’s due to the fact I do not want to exist, but I do. Just not as me. 

There’s so many things I’ve want to do with my day but I don’t. I’m too much of a dumbass to achieve anything high because I’m fairly slow and need things explained step by step inch by inch and it’s infuriating. It’s like I’m a normal person trapped inside of a fucking spastic. I come home from work with a plan set out for the day then i just melt in bed all day. I hate everything about my physical body, lanky, shit smile, ugly hands, weird head shape and weird posture. And also my personality sucks, if I’m out drinking with friends I’m just an awkward bastard who’s too busy thinking about not being an awkward bastard leaving me in an awkward bastard loop. So I haven’t went out drinking in a long time. I interrupt people and I’m shit at eye contact. I’ve also been told I have thoughtless eyes multiple times which further proves my stupidness, also been compared to a pet dog. It’s pretty upsetting tbh, knowing your liked, but are only wanted with funny/ weird stuff. I’m too odd for someone to want to come to me for real problems or asking for advice, I have never once been asked for advice because everyone knows their smarter than me. 

Living all my life being asked “How do you think”. “Why did you do it that way”. “Why didn’t you just do this”. “Your a one of a kind”. “I’d love to be in your head for a day”. Is frustrating because every day is a constant reminder I’m not normal. 

I unfortunately haven’t wanted to live for about 2 years now. Who the hell wants to live fighting their stupidity all their life. Forgetting everything, procrastinating, not understanding simple instructions. So it always annoys me when I hear “to find happiness find yourself” and all this “find what you love”.

I was diagnosed with depresion and high intelectual potential. This HIP things makes me really sensitive and I'm mad about it because I feel different from everybody all the time.

The way I am makes me sick because I feel so immature. I had a lot of difficulties in high school because I didn't like the way it was and now it's the same but it's worse because I chose my studies... I am passionate about planes and want to become a fighter pilot but I feel like I'll never be one because of the way I am, my psychology. I am too immature and I have a lot of issues dealing with my emotions. I feel like a total faillure and think about s\*\*\*\*\* a lot knowing I won't do I because I'm a coward.

Since I started my studies, I feel like I&amp;#39;m not in the right place so I decided to go for something else but the procedures are really slow and I&amp;#39;m stuck doing something I don&amp;#39;t like. The way I am makes me sick because I feel so immature. I had a lot of difficulties in high school because I didn&amp;#39;t like the way it was and now it&amp;#39;s the same but it&amp;#39;s worse because I chose my studies... I am passionate about planes and want to become a fighter pilot but I feel like I&amp;#39;ll never be one because of the way I am, my psychology. I am too immature and I have a lot of issues dealing with my emotions. I feel like a total faillure and think about s***** a lot knowing I won&amp;#39;t do I because I&amp;#39;m a coward. I thought my depression was way behind me but eventually it came back. I&amp;#39;m lost. I feel like I&amp;#39;m living in a world that is not made for me. I am ashamed of myself and don&amp;#39;t feel like seeing a psychologist again. What is f ing wrong with me ? I feel weak and would like to control myself, my emotions, a lot more....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;please If you have any advice or similar experience, feel free to share &lt;/p&gt;

I seriously thought I would be dead right now, I never once really even thought of a path that had me living as an actual adult. I know 18 isn't quite an adult but I can't help compare my life to my peers. 

I never thought I would be alive for college, so I never thought about it. Now I feel left behind. 

I think many of my friends are very skilled and creative for their age, or at least they have something going on. Not me. 

Some of these people are already living on their own, or they are saving up to live on their own.

Again, thought I would be dead by now. The Money from the Job I did have I wasted, spent on myself and sometimes others. The time right after graduating was actually a happy time for me and I was doing a lot of reckless things just because. again, I just thought this was a wrap up. 

I know this is my fault. I have nobody to blame but myself in this situation and I have previously victimized myself. I have lived most of my life with MDD and anxiety, so my mindset is very negative centered. 

I've done nothing, and yet I feel exhausted. Like I'm at a dead end. I honestly wish regularly that I could restart my life, have a completely new life, or somehow get amnesia so I can work from the ground up again. 

I hate myself. I hate my personality. I hate my stubbornness and comfortability of being depressed and lonely despite also wanting to change. 

The last few months I have seriously considered suicide, the only thing really holding me back is the people who care about me but I know they are also sick of me. And even if they do love me or enjoy my company, I honestly don't understand that. My family and friends are burnt out from my constant ranting and negativity. Nobody made me feel like a burden, I can visibly see that is the situation here.

But I just... don't know what to do with myself. And I'm painfully aware of how hard that journey is going to be when I do decide what to do with myself.  There's also a constant paranoia about everything going on in the world right now I feel like there is no point to anything. 

I could go on and on about that but I will choose not to. My main point is I just don't know what to do, I want to change literally everything about myself but I feel like it's too late or too difficult but I know I shouldn't ask for help from other people because I know that doesn't work I just end up ranting with an overwhelmed person next to me.

&lt;p&gt;Being in the hospital, I missed a couple of days worth of classes, and because of that I am behind on the material being taught in class. Midterms are coming up and I am feeling overwhelmed. I&amp;#39;m feeling really stressed, and I do not know how to bounce back, I am trying my best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just really want to disappear, I do not want to feel these feeling anymore. I wish I had my life before I got sent to the hospital; and I am scared that I won&amp;#39;t ever be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"
I’ve been struggling with depression for about two years, or at least that’s when I first realized something was wrong. Back then, I managed to “handle it,” meaning I didn’t let it interfere with my responsibilities, and I hid it well. No one could tell I was depressed. However, in the last six months, things have gotten worse. I’ve been having trouble sleeping, took a break from school, and spend my days sitting around without any motivation to go out or see friends. I’ve lost 10kg due to a lack of appetite, and I feel like my mind has slowed down.

People around me, my parents, friends, and coworkers have noticed the change, but I’ve been brushing it off as just a bad sleep schedule. I’ve been scared to seek help because I felt embarrassed. I don’t have any clear reason to be depressed, so what was I supposed to say? But in recent weeks, things have gotten worse. I’ve found myself constantly thinking about self harm, and I’ve realized that I’ve reached the point where I can no longer ignore my mental health.

I finally called my clinic and told them I was depressed and needed an assessment, along with a plan for medication like antidepressants. I’ve got an appointment scheduled for next week, and I feel a sense of relief for taking action. But I’ve decided to keep this to myself for now. It’s actually pretty easy to get prescribed antidepressants in my country, so I’ll likely get a prescription that same day, and they’re quite affordable. Therapy, on the other hand, is much harder to access unless you can afford to go private, which I can’t. To be honest, I’m not ready for therapy right now anyway.

My plan is to start with antidepressants and, once I start feeling a little better, I’ll look into therapy. I’m aware that there are side effects with antidepressants, but I can’t imagine they could be worse than spending every night thinking about dying and wasting my days in misery. So I’m willing to take the risk and see if they help me improve.

I’ll update you guys on my progress if anyone would like to follow along, otherwise have a good day!

,depression,"Hi. I know people on here aren't clinical psychologists, but I think I might be depressed and I wanted to see if anyone could relate to my situation or just have any commentary on it.

I'll start by saying I don't always feel like I'm depressed, but it's more like I have good weeks/months and bad weeks/months. Sometimes I feel completely normal, happy even. Then, seemingly out of nowhere one bad thing will send me on a spiral for weeks at a time. During these times, I think very negatively of myself and criticize every mistake/action I do. I also lose motivation for my hobbies, friends, and education (I am 20M in my 3rd year of a bachelors degree.) However, even during these episodes I manage to function pretty well. My hobbies and personal life definitely takes a hit, but I kind of just autopilot through school and social interactions and I do alright. It's just the whole time I don't really want to do anything that I'm doing, but rather I'm doing them out of obligation and to preserve the relationships I have. The whole time I'm on autopilot I'm just thinking about how I messed up X or I'm a shitty person for Y or I'm just dreading having to drag myself through Z. All I want to do is get through my obligations so I can lay in bed and do nothing or just sleep, only to wake up immediately feeling like shit and having to do it all over again.

Some additional information:
I do not have sleeping problems.
I exercise regularly (4-5x 90mins per week.)
I have a good diet (I don't anymore but I used to track macros for the gym and I have a balanced diet with only the occasional treat.)
I live at home, my dad and stepmom love me and treat me well.
My parents are divorced (12 years)

,depression,"I'm a 28yo F and have no motivation to keep moving forward. When I was in my early twenties and single, I was very motivated, I wanted to travel, worked hard, enjoyed life. Now at 28, my current life is something people dream of, I have a stable job working at an amazing company, I'm engaged and in a loving relationship, I have a healthy body and pretty active, however, I feel so empty. My partner is pretty successful, prior to meeting him I had financial goals I wanted to tackle, however, no amount of money I can make will amount to what he has and so I've given up on it. He's given me a stable household, we live in a great neighborhood, although he's busy he always makes time for me and makes me feel like a priority, and on top of that we enjoy each others company, I truly feel like I've met my soulmate. We've been dating for about 4 years and will marry by the end of the year.

2 years ago I moved to the Bay Area to be with his family, currently, I have no friends and the brother I do have in the bay we don't really talk anymore. We spend a lot of time with his MIL and she has severe anxiety and depression, his dad passed away over a year ago and it's just him and his mom, so we spend a lot of our time with her. 

I want to try so hard to be positive and find happiness but I truly feel like I have nothing to live for. My fiance tells me that I should live for him and our future kids, but I feel like if I passed away he would be okay and be able to move on, but if it was vice versa I would be in shambles emotionally and financially. He is not the type to dwell on the negative and has a job he's passionate about which is why I feel he'd be able to move on. I want to change my mindset and be more present, I read books and listen to podcasts and videos, I truly want to change, but I have no drive to live.

I've seen a therapist and she was great, but I cannot fill that empty void. I feel like I'm wasting my life away by being this way, I don't want to wake up at 70 years old and realize I've lived my life depressed and anxious. I wake up unmotivated to start the day.

Recently, I've lost my interest in traveling, I don't have many friends or family I speak to, my job is to work on different units to fill in voids in the company so I don't have a set group of coworkers I can talk to or hang out with. On my days off what I truly want to do is sleep, I look forward to sleeping as much as I looked forward to traveling in the past. I know this is not normal. 

It's also worth noting I've seen a Dr and was started on antidepressants over a year ago which has helped. However, that feeling of no having a purpose still lingers

I've been given such a good opportunity, my partner pays for most of the bills and encourages me to go out and try new hobbies with my money, he truly wants me to be happy and it breaks my heart I can't do that for him.

,depression,"It's now 8:37 in Kanazawa in Japan. This is my 2nd trip here from the states, I tend to travel far distances when I have time/funds to do so, in the hopes that it will silence my thoughts, hatred and anxiety but this time around it has done anything but that; I just nearly got hit by a cab because I was Charlie brown walking like I've been doing since I got here. An englishman saw me and looked at me like I was scum, trash that shouldn't dirty up his pretty street. Then he smiled and said, go on...do it. My reply was that I don't really have a lot to lose, and now I think back and it makes my chest heart, thinking about how sad I continue to be, 42 years here, have been on all the meds, therapy, have good friends, about to start RN school after being an LVN for 4 years. But I feel like I should've stepped out off that curb. Chest pain as a physical manifestation of my sorrow, im tired of it hurting. I hate myself, so fucking much. I'm so tired and defeated, tricking myself into loving me, like losing weight, getting g a good job, being a nice, funny person. But the cloud always comes back. You can't tell by these words but I'm a funny guy, class clown, people have always know me as smart and funny, funny and smart, but now I just feel...sterile. Grey, metallic, cold. I'm more afraid of losing my sense of humor than I am of dying and I feel like I'm losing my ability to  be mysef to that extent. 

Ive been here for 18 days now, been all across the country, but my resentment towards myself and complete strangers is growing quite strong. Furthermore, and this is quite a big problem, even though I might not suffer ""immediate"" effect from it, is the fact that...I'm cheap. I put this trip together after I left my job so I can start the RN program in December, this was a gift to myself. I spent time trying to plan it all thrifty, I flew coach, cheap hotels, didn't plan on anything extravagant, and, honestly, I haven't done anything extravagant. I didn't get an escort, like I thought of (which also contributes to my sadness, the lack of female companionship, even one that I'd pay for). I didn't eat high priced meals, conversely, most nights I eat 7-11 in my room as I watch stand-up sets on YouTube. But somehow I've spent almost 2 grand thus far, I honestly don't know how it's possible. I bought 3 pairs of running shoes, a piece of luggage, a knife and various other small souvenirs but I swear to anything worth swearing to: there's absolutely no way I spent that much money here. It's driving me insane because I have the ATM receipts and the withdrawals seem to add up. Even if I was short-changed, numerous times, and lost some yen on the street, I still don't think or feel like ive spent more than $1k. It's like I did it all in a blackout and didn't get any joy from it, i have no bloody clue what a huge portion of that expenditure got me. My dad used to spend his depression away (with mom's money), I hated him for it. And now I just did the same. The englishman shouldve pushed me more. I haven't a clue where so much of it went and it's killing me.

So that's my little story. I've been journaling during these weeks, I used to write creatively for fun and I was good at it, but this is just getting too dark and colorless. Too Bukowski but without the appeal or success. I wrote a letter to my dead dog, pleading for forgiveness for giving him portions of my dinners that I didn't have the self control not to eat (successful  anorexic, lost 100 lbs, it didn't help me, but surely it killed my dog). My eatng disorder gave my dog cancer. And now my mom has cancer. She's the reason I haven't left here yet, because I know it'd destroy her.

This is my 2nd trip here from the states, I tend to travel far distances when I have time/funds to do so, in the hopes that it will silence my thoughts, hatred and anxiety but this time around it has done anything but that; I just nearly got hit by a cab because I was Charlie brown walking like I&amp;#39;ve been doing since I got here. An englishman saw me and looked at me like I was scum, trash that shouldn&amp;#39;t dirty up his pretty street. Then he smiled and said, go on...do it. My reply was that I don&amp;#39;t really have a lot to lose, and now I think back and it makes my chest heart, thinking about how sad I continue to be, 42 years here, have been on all the meds, therapy, have good friends, about to start RN school after being an LVN for 4 years. But I feel like I should&amp;#39;ve stepped out off that curb. Chest pain as a physical manifestation of my sorrow, im tired of it hurting. I hate myself, so fucking much. I&amp;#39;m so tired and defeated, tricking myself into loving me, like losing weight, getting g a good job, being a nice, funny person. But the cloud always comes back. You can&amp;#39;t tell by these words but I&amp;#39;m a funny guy, class clown, people have always know me as smart and funny, funny and smart, but now I just feel...sterile. Grey, metallic, cold. I&amp;#39;m more afraid of losing my sense of humor than I am of dying and I feel like I&amp;#39;m losing my ability to  be mysef to that extent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive been here for 18 days now, been all across the country, but my resentment towards myself and complete strangers is growing quite strong. Furthermore, and this is quite a big problem, even though I might not suffer &amp;quot;immediate&amp;quot; effect from it, is the fact that...I&amp;#39;m cheap. I put this trip together after I left my job so I can start the RN program in December, this was a gift to myself. I spent time trying to plan it all thrifty, I flew coach, cheap hotels, didn&amp;#39;t plan on anything extravagant, and, honestly, I haven&amp;#39;t done anything extravagant. I didn&amp;#39;t get an escort, like I thought of (which also contributes to my sadness, the lack of female companionship, even one that I&amp;#39;d pay for). I didn&amp;#39;t eat high priced meals, conversely, most nights I eat 7-11 in my room as I watch stand-up sets on YouTube. But somehow I&amp;#39;ve spent almost 2 grand thus far, I honestly don&amp;#39;t know how it&amp;#39;s possible. I bought 3 pairs of running shoes, a piece of luggage, a knife and various other small souvenirs but I swear to anything worth swearing to: there&amp;#39;s absolutely no way I spent that much money here. It&amp;#39;s driving me insane because I have the ATM receipts and the withdrawals seem to add up. Even if I was short-changed, numerous times, and lost some yen on the street, I still don&amp;#39;t think or feel like ive spent more than $1k. It&amp;#39;s like I did it all in a blackout and didn&amp;#39;t get any joy from it, i have no bloody clue what a huge portion of that expenditure got me. My dad used to spend his depression away (with mom&amp;#39;s money), I hated him for it. And now I just did the same. The englishman shouldve pushed me more. I haven&amp;#39;t a clue where so much of it went and it&amp;#39;s killing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s my little story. I&amp;#39;ve been journaling during these weeks, I used to write creatively for fun and I was good at it, but this is just getting too dark and colorless. Too Bukowski but without the appeal or success. I wrote a letter to my dead dog, pleading for forgiveness for giving him portions of my dinners that I didn&amp;#39;t have the self control not to eat (successful  anorexic, lost 100 lbs, it didn&amp;#39;t help me, but surely it killed my dog). My eatng disorder gave my dog cancer. And now my mom has cancer. She&amp;#39;s the reason I haven&amp;#39;t left here yet, because I know it&amp;#39;d destroy her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s raining in Kanaza now, dress shoes splash through the puddles, empty cabs are flying by, I&amp;#39;m eating expensive matcha algetto, a family is walking their dog across the way and all I can do is fight looking at my reflection in the cafe window, trying to hear only the sound of a language I can&amp;#39;t comprehend in the hopes of distracting me from myself.

,depression,"This isn't directly associated with depression but it is a byproduct of it. 

For context I'm a 27M who started dating late at 25. The reasons I didn't date is because I grew up fat and on the ugly side hence the depression. I was severely depressed for about 15 years as a result. 

Eventually I got my act together. I started exercising, dressed better, was more comfident, etc. I'm not super attractive now but I don't feel ugly anymore. I have a good sense of humor, a good personality so it adds charm. A year prior to this ""glow up"" I went through a drug induced psychosis that completely blunted my emotions. As a result it added to my already existing mental health issues. Which leads me to my question. What exactly is love supposed to feel like? 

Just last week I ended my relationship with my first girlfriend ever. She's 25 and surprisingly I was her first boyfriend too. Which I'm glad because I felt that we could relate to each other. She was sweet, she was beautiful, she was caring, she was kind, she was a pain the ass.

She had the attitude of a 13 year old girl who just started her first relationship and she has characteristics of a female And rew T-8 (I can't post the name or it gets removed). I have never given her a reason to act this way. She gets offended by absolutely everything and always expected me to give her solutions to her problems, most of which had no solution. 

I thought I loved her and I was willing to stay because I thought she was worth it. I was always the one trying to make things work but she never did because a ""woman shouldn't beg, and because she didn't need me and she could survive without me.""

As bad as it sounds those were just the negative things about her, she eventually realized what she said and always apologized. She said she got mad and lost her cool

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, she did something else so I threatened to leave her and she has completely changed. She said she was stupid for being so childish for so long. She says she doesn't want me to leave and she promises she will change. Which I do believe her but she's still somewhat childish.

Last week I got tired of it and left for good. Back to the emotional blunting. Prior to her I was in a situationship with a woman I didn't love. She liked me but I never liked her back. We were too different. She was somewhat ghetto but I somehow got along with her.

Anyway, I never got to experience a relationship without the emotional blunting. I fear that I won't ever know what love is. My first girlfriend is a beautiful woman and she does have have her pros. But I often wondered if I coulf meet someone ""better."" And not more attractive but someone I resonate with more.

Even when we weren't having problems, I sometimes wondered if I meeting someone with my same interests would be better? What is love exactly? I started dating later so part of me wants to ""play the field"" to figure out my options but it feels pathetic at my age. And truth be told I don't have the energy I did in my early 20s. I have responsibilities and expectations now. 

Do you always have to resonate with someone for it to be 100% love? Is it okay for you to not be 100% compatible with your partner? Do opposites really attract? I don't know, I don't understand. I fear the emotional blunting will never make me feel who the right person is. I just need some advice. Thanks.

Hi, I'm a 17M with depression and no more reasons to live. 988 is useless and hangs up on me, abd therapists don't show up to appointments anymore. Nobody will schedule with me, then actually show up. Happened so much that I can't get a legal therapist in my state because there are none left, and out of state therapy is illegal.

I have no reason to be depressed. I have both parents and a good family life. I have achievements, and I'm gifted according to everyone around me, but I don't ever feel like I'm worth anything. I keep pushing myself towards goals, like getting my eagle scout rank or top 1k in the world in beat saber, or even getting any kind of skill at games I've been playing for years, but I never feel any kind of accomplishment from getting something I worked my ass off for.

My real life friends don't care, my online friends are tired of listening to me, and my parents want to help, but I don't put this on them because they have enough to worry about.

I don't know what I have to do to be happy. I've tried so many hobbies and gotten no skill at them over months of trying, and also no joy from stepping back and just trying to have fun. I've tried a list of hobbies, as follows: Drawing/painting 3D printing PC gaming Vacationing House flipping Soap operas Woodworking Forest exploring Virtual reality Road tripping Writing Shotgun and rifle shooting 3D modeling Anime Camping Comedy shows Gardening Coding PC building Car detailing Crocheting Whittling Pet husbandry Doom scrolling

mind you, each for months at a time.

I'm so tired of not getting better at things that I gave up and just decided to search for happiness instead of skill.

So after a few years of searching, I went back to skill hunting because I was still empty.

Now I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place on whether or not I should even keep going. I don't have any measurable worth, any type of real hobby or interest, any hope that I'll get better because of how I've been rejected over and over, and having been empty since I was 3.

My psychiatrist refuses to diagnose me with ADHD or autism (did diagnose with depression, on meds) so i can get medicated or treated despite others saying I have it based on everything else but one test result, and like I said I can't get a therapist to show up in person, online, or even under one of my parents' names.

TLDR: please help, therapists ghost me, no skills, severe depression with no apparant cause and very likely undiagnosed ADHD.",t2_1aqesu4tho,False,,0,False,Help,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_1gabfiw,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1729692444.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway account, don&amp;#39;t use Reddit, responses might be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;#39;m a 17M with depression and no more reasons to live. 988 is useless and hangs up on me, abd therapists don&amp;#39;t show up to appointments anymore. Nobody will schedule with me, then actually show up. Happened so much that I can&amp;#39;t get a legal therapist in my state because there are none left, and out of state therapy is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no reason to be depressed. I have both parents and a good family life. I have achievements, and I&amp;#39;m gifted according to everyone around me, but I don&amp;#39;t ever feel like I&amp;#39;m worth anything. I keep pushing myself towards goals, like getting my eagle scout rank or top 1k in the world in beat saber, or even getting any kind of skill at games I&amp;#39;ve been playing for years, but I never feel any kind of accomplishment from getting something I worked my ass off for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My real life friends don&amp;#39;t care, my online friends are tired of listening to me, and my parents want to help, but I don&amp;#39;t put this on them because they have enough to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what I have to do to be happy. I&amp;#39;ve tried so many hobbies and gotten no skill at them over months of trying, and also no joy from stepping back and just trying to have fun. I&amp;#39;ve tried a list of hobbies, as follows: Drawing/painting 3D printing PC gaming Vacationing House flipping Soap operas Woodworking Forest exploring Virtual reality Road tripping Writing Shotgun and rifle shooting 3D modeling Anime Camping Comedy shows Gardening Coding PC building Car detailing Crocheting Whittling Pet husbandry Doom scrolling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mind you, each for months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so tired of not getting better at things that I gave up and just decided to search for happiness instead of skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after a few years of searching, I went back to skill hunting because I was still empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m stuck between a rock and a hard place on whether or not I should even keep going. I don&amp;#39;t have any measurable worth, any type of real hobby or interest, any hope that I&amp;#39;ll get better because of how I&amp;#39;ve been rejected over and over, and having been empty since I was 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My psychiatrist refuses to diagnose me with ADHD or autism (did diagnose with depression, on meds) so i can get medicated or treated despite others saying I have it based on everything else but one test result, and like I said I can&amp;#39;t get a therapist to show up in person, online, or even under one of my parents&amp;#39; names. It&amp;#39;s like the whole system is designed to make you kill yourself so they don&amp;#39;t have to pay therapists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sorry for long post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: please help, therapists ghost me, no skills, severe depression with no apparant cause and very likely undiagnosed ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Since I was very young, I've always valued humbleness and self-awareness a lot, and disrespected arrogance. I've always understood that bragging is what people do when they aren't finding that validation inside.

I've also always been very easily disturbed by fiction. Five years ago a fictional show permanently ruined my outlook on life and perception of people. One of the characters was a cold emotionally distant soldier who was later revealed to have once been an innocent and harmless child until a tragic event. At the time it was nothing new to me. Until later when the character simply said 'I am strong' and I perceived the characters as slightly more intimidating but also lost some respect. It took about 6 months for this fictional scene to take over my subconscious and once I realised how I felt I started to feel hopeless. The transformation felt a lot worse than if the character just died. Even though I knew it wasn't real, how could someone change so quickly, so exaggeratedly and how is everyone but me OK with this? I was desperate to know everything about this character, especially the ending. I was desperate for them to return to their harmless compassionate self. The show wasn't finished so all I could do was endlessly theorize when I was on vacation, at college, went to sleep, and woke up.

At some point, I burnt the bridge with the show and never watched anything associated with it again. The source never bothered me again, but the habits I developed have got so much worse. I continued the same routine with multiple fictional characters and soon real people. My life entirely revolves around this fear, it's all I am inside. If I were to summarise it, it's a fear of change specifically in strength. This could be physically, mentally, socially, even financially. Things that I must feel are worth bragging about. Arrogance didn't bother me until that fictional character planted the idea that maybe it didn't come out of nowhere.

My attempts to debunk my own fears that every single person is capable of changing in this direction have instead led me to learn how unpredictably malleable humans are and that I'm safe from no one. I don't care if it is unlikely, if it's possible it's already happened. There is no predicting and that makes me want to hide away until I'm dead. I'm now entirely incapable of making friends, relationships, unconditional love. I don't know who I am to tell people who they shouldn't be which is why I can never tell anyone about this. I'm deeply ashamed of it. It briefly led me to cutting myself but after that one time, I felt like I was able to take control of my feelings a lot more.

Even though it has been a lot better these past few years, and I've gotten the hang of ignoring things that bother me. I feel exactly how I did 5 years ago but with a real person who is pretty much the embodiment of everything I've been trying to deny. So this person became a fitness influencer and is physically stronger and looks different which usually I'd be able to handle if it wasn't for the arrogant and self-admiration persona. I can't tell if it's a played-up persona and because I can't tell, it hasn't left my mind in two weeks. This person also likes to use before and after comparisons to inspire as well as provoke the non-supporters. The worst thing about all this is that it happened in their 40s. 20 years of being a normal adult. They never used to come across that way at all. Either they've always been like this or desired to be, or they literally mentally changed their personality making their old self a victim to their physical transformation, if I can even admit to myself that it's possible. Either way I'm unhappy but the latter is so much worse. I know it's possible to an extent but it makes me want to repeatedly smash my head into a wall.

I don't know why I'm writing this but until now I haven't been able to admit the specifics of my feelings so in a way it's progress. I'd be so grateful if people could just say what they think about this, maybe give advice on what I should do.",t2_9h817zws,False,,0,False,I don't know who anyone is,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_1gaakil,False,dark,0.99,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1729690107.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I was very young, I&amp;#39;ve always valued humbleness and self-awareness a lot, and disrespected arrogance.

,depression,"so me and my girlfriend had a fight last night, well it wasn't actually a fight and more of a misunderstanding that left us both feeling empty or atleast thats my understanding of the situation. 

The argument went along the lines of her feeling neglected in the relationship which was true cuz I was dealing with some things that we fought about before which I thought were concluded. Turns out I still overthink things from the past and I can never seem to let them go, I keep obsessing over the smallest things which would cause us to fight more. 

Last nights' fight was no different from the others but now she doesn't want to talk to me and Im scared she'd leave me. We're a fairly new couple not even a month into the relationship yet. And this was my first relationship after 3 years, and my last relationship ended in the same fashion. I'd be having trouble expressing myself, she would feel neglected, we'd fight, and that was the end of it.

I'm scared that this would be the same but I'm holding on for dear life that she would stay. I have faith in her that she will, and I know she just needs some time right now.

I just wish someone would tell me everything is going to be okay. I'm starting to hate myself again for being the reason my girlfriend is crying right now and I can never seem to pull myself together in moments like these when she needs me most.

I miss her so much. Specially since we can't see each other right now because of some bad weather conditions and that the college we go to has suspended classes today, and possibly for the rest of the week.

,depression,"Hello,

I have a lot of things that I need to get off my chest, so I apologize if this post seems all over the place.

2 years ago(2022) my father committed suicide and we ended up moving into his house a few months later. By we, I mean myself, my mom, my 2 older sisters, their husbands, and their children(4 in total). Over the next year, my mom told her nephew to come over with his wife and child because they wanted to move from Mexico to the United States. They eventually did, and my sisters ended up giving birth to 2 more kids, bringing the total number of people living here to 15. And these people literally drive me insane because the husband is 27 and the wife is 25 with the kid being 10, and the kid has ADHD, which irritates his parents and it’s starting the irritate me because they never give him any attention. Whenever the kid wants to talk to his parents, they give him the phone and they go away to their room, which by the way, our house only has two bedrooms and a living room, and my sister had to buy once of those mobile homes for her, her husband and their kids to live in, but that means that in total, 5 people are living there, and 10 are living in the main house, and it gets worse when they come to eat at the main home with all the kids being there and Mexicans just being loud in general. I’m Mexican so I feel like I can say that and get away with it, because it’s true. I can’t afford to move out because I can’t drive, I don’t have a car, I deal with a lot of anxiety, and I’m always providing for my mom when she needs something. I know being around family should be good for you, but every time I’m surrounded by my family, I just think about doing what my dad did. I can’t even focus on school anymore because it’s so overwhelming and going to a public library won’t help because being outside of home gives me anxiety, but being at home already gives me a lot of anxiety and depression. They’ve spoken about moving out when the lady starts working, but the lady can barely handle taking care of her kid and her husband and she barely does anything at home, so getting a job is honestly out of the question, and her husband doesn’t even want her to work.
