,insomnia,"My experience and advice may help you if we struggle with similar things like:
* you have extreme anxiety about sleep
* you try to make everything ""just right"" at bedtime so you are more likely to sleep, if things are thrown off you usually don't sleep at all
* going to bed early because it gives you more time to ""fall asleep"" so you don't have to get as anxious about it
* planning your days around sleep
* inability to nap
* anytime you wake up from sleeping you are instantly anxious if it's not morning or relieved that it is and you don't have to worry about sleeping until it's bedtime
* while laying in bed you have an overactive brain

Advice:
-the root cause-

If your insomnia is anything like mine was, you feel like sleeping is entirely out of your control. Whenever you do manage to fall asleep, you wake up and it feels like a miracle. It doesn't feel like it should be possible for you because you're so used to months or years of broken sleep. You don't believe you can fix this problem because you've tried and it can't be done.

The thing is, you're right, you don't have control over your sleep. Your body does.

•Your body controls your sleep, not your brain.

Internalize that sentence lol

It means you need practice connecting with your body. This isn't spiritual hippie stuff. You just literally need to get in touch with your body again. People sleep when they're tired. You're tired from sleep deprivation, and if left be, your body would sleep. This is natural and not something you technically have to learn. When you're a baby, you don't even understand what sleep is and you do it. You have developed a psychological resistance to it.

How do you stop resisting sleep with your brain?

First step: practice resting

How I did this was by setting aside time during the day (NOT bedtime) to rest. This meant I had to choose a day that was free. Ideally a day you have NO responsibilities to worry about. Or at least minimal.

Schedule in 2-3 hours to rest. Essentially, the goal is to first learn how to nap when the stakes are low. During a moment of the day when you're feeling extra tired (and it's not bedtime), take some time to rest. That way, if you don't fall asleep during resting time, you won't be anxious because it wasn't bedtime anyway.

The other goal with this is to overcome your anxiety with consistent practice resting.

Even if you don't sleep from doing this, you are still giving your body time to recover. Just laying there and keeping yourself calm is beneficial.

Regarding it being daytime, I decided this because I observed other people's sleeping habits in my life and noticed that when they didn't sleep enough one night, they'd take naps easily later during the day. Whatever is normal to the average person, I wanted to be able to do.

Rules for resting:
* daytime
* 2-3 hours
* currently feel tired
* no urgent responsibilities
* lay down in a darkish room
* eyes closed
* minimal noise
* no TV, movies, phone (put it on silent), or computer, no stimulus
* get comfortable and cozy
* try to calm your thoughts, don't linger in negative ones
* don't check the clock, instead set an alarm


The biggest challenge is to calm your thoughts. I would remind myself ""it's resting time, resting isn't for problem solving"". This isn't the time to think about all your issues and sort them out. Instead, it's more similar to meditation. When you notice your thoughts tensing up, you shift focus and remind yourself it's time to relax. But this also means you should not be over-policing your thoughts. First, feel how tired your body is, concentrate on that. Then let your mind drift. You are learning to give your body back it's control without interfering. It's not easy, honestly, but if you practice, training your mind is possible.

Practice this as often as possible. It takes a lot of time. By doing this, I gradually learned to nap. Once I learned to nap several days in a row by practicing taking a rest, I felt confident in my ability to nap. I was then able to go to bed at night knowing if I don't fall asleep now, I can nap later in the day.

Make sure to check in with yourself often (on a daily basis) and notice if your body is extra tired. If you have the time, get used to responding to your body's needs and making that time ""resting time"".

Next step: learn to go back to sleep once  you've woken up in the middle of the night

Every time I woke up in the middle of the night, I'd calm my anxiety by closing down negative thoughts and basically comforting myself. Reminding myself it's not time for worrying. This is really difficult. That's why you've gotta practice and learn to face yourself.

Last step: learn to sleep extra, just for  the extra confidence.

Once you are able to sleep through the night, on a day you aren't busy, teach yourself to sleep extra. For example, you wake up after 8 hours of sleep and still feel sleepy. Take this time to sleep more! Trust me, it's like the cherry on top for your confidence at bedtime. By doing this, you will teach your body to sleep more than the necessary hours. This will make you feel like you can sleep extra if you have accumulated sleep debt during the week.

Once this happened, my life started to change, not to be dramatic. I felt less anxious at bedtime. I also was able to let my body relax because my mind was no longer basically attacking it with anxiety. I eventually I started sleeping at night!

And the #1 WORST thing you can do that still affects me to this day is look at your phone!!! Don't!!
I cured my insomnia in July and since then, the main thing that has prevented me from sleeping some nights is looking at my phone in bed.

I'm aware that this isn't revolutionary. But as a backstory, I've had sleep anxiety since I was about 10 years old. For the last 3 years, my life became more stressful and I probably slept 8 hours only 50 days each year.

I've gone weeks of 2-3 hours of sleep each night. I was basically always living in fight or flight. Controlling my emotions became impossible and they stopped making sense to me. I was constantly shaking. My skin broke out like never before, which is still something I'm trying to fix. I feel like I've been through the worst imaginable things in my mind during this time and existed in darkness for years. At the height of it, I would panic and cry to the point that my headaches would get so bad my eyesight would give out a bit. I was acting a bit schizophrenic from sleep deprivation and was just generally being crazy every day. I hyper focused on things that didn't even matter.

If you're in the same situation, I feel for you so much.

This is what worked for me. I am sure it goes without saying that it will not work for everyone. However, I still believe that if there is no underlying health condition, this could help anyone. Because at the end of the day, your body does want you to sleep.

,insomnia,"First, I apologize as Spanish is my current language.

I am a 28M who had insomnia since the 20ish. I was a medical school student and all were fine. i began working at McDonald’s on afternoons and nighttime since 4/5 o’clock to pay my career since I’ve got some financial problems when I was on 2nd year of med school.

I began with anxiety and insomnia issues since my circadian rhythms were fucked every weekend and tired as hell because I often slept like 3-4 hours. After all, I was a nice student and with BZD on board I could pass all exams since 5th year. On that year, familiar issues + more exigencies of Medicine got me in a horrendous conciliation insomnia with BZD (lormetazepam, alprazolam) so the first time that a psychiatrist saw me she told me that we need to stop this and give me mirtazapine for sleep. STOP BZD.

Mirtazapine went like magic, increased appetite but bearable, little drowsiness but I could live with that. I finished med school with mirtazapine and an acceptable quality of sleep. I was still working on Mc Donald’s at that time as well. 

I left working on McDonald’s bc in Spain we need a full year focused on studing for “MIR” exam, where you choose your specialty and location depending on the score of a 4 hour examination. 

Insomnia got worse being incapable of sleeping “at normal” hours like 0-1:00 (night). I asked my provider some help and give me Zolpidem. That new zolpidem+mirtazapine combo worked very well since exams ended and mirtazapine easily went off to 0 since then.

In between, some doc try to change mirtazapine with citalopram but got some serious sexual dysfunction so were a “no-no”

Now, I am a happy 4th anesthesiologist resident at my institution and I enjoy what I do; but shifting is horrible and fuck my circadian rhythms. Melatonin doesn’t works (tho it helps) and I’ve developed zolpidem tolerance in 5 years of usage. 

Currently, I am turning to seek help for this situation. My psychiatrist gave me 2 mg of lorazepam to combine with zolpidem but i don’t feel any difference. The only thing that it improves are nightmares that i’ve began to experience with working-issues after a long shift. If I’m not into a shift, I barely sleep 3 hours and I’m exhausted daytime, probably bc got some benzo cross-tolerance being with zolpidem.

I don’t know the answer of this situation. I am currently seeking for more appointments with my psychiatrist and psychologist and looking for his advice, but I feel that I’m a 28 yo “successful” anesthesiologist with a neurochemistry absolutely fucked, and I need to vent this.

I am often joking about “I’m an anesthesiologist who can put anyone to sleep except myself”

&lt;p&gt;I am a 28M who had insomnia since the 20ish. I was a medical school student and all were fine. i began working at McDonald’s on afternoons and nighttime since 4/5 o’clock to pay my career since I’ve got some financial problems when I was on 2nd year of med school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began with anxiety and insomnia issues since my circadian rhythms were fucked every weekend and tired as hell because I often slept like 3-4 hours. After all, I was a nice student and with BZD on board I could pass all exams since 5th year. On that year, familiar issues + more exigencies of Medicine got me in a horrendous conciliation insomnia with BZD (lormetazepam, alprazolam) so the first time that a psychiatrist saw me she told me that we need to stop this and give me mirtazapine for sleep. STOP BZD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirtazapine went like magic, increased appetite but bearable, little drowsiness but I could live with that. I finished med school with mirtazapine and an acceptable quality of sleep. I was still working on Mc Donald’s at that time as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left working on McDonald’s bc in Spain we need a full year focused on studing for “MIR” exam, where you choose your specialty and location depending on the score of a 4 hour examination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insomnia got worse being incapable of sleeping “at normal” hours like 0-1:00 (night). I asked my provider some help and give me Zolpidem. That new zolpidem+mirtazapine combo worked very well since exams ended and mirtazapine easily went off to 0 since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between, some doc try to change mirtazapine with citalopram but got some serious sexual dysfunction so were a “no-no”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I am a happy 4th anesthesiologist resident at my institution and I enjoy what I do; but shifting is horrible and fuck my circadian rhythms. Melatonin doesn’t works (tho it helps) and I’ve developed zolpidem tolerance in 5 years of usage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am turning to seek help for this situation. My psychiatrist gave me 2 mg of lorazepam to combine with zolpidem but i don’t feel any difference. The only thing that it improves are nightmares that i’ve began to experience with working-issues after a long shift. If I’m not into a shift, I barely sleep 3 hours and I’m exhausted daytime, probably bc got some benzo cross-tolerance being with zolpidem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know the answer of this situation. I am currently seeking for more appointments with my psychiatrist and psychologist and looking for his advice, but I feel that I’m a 28 yo “successful” anesthesiologist with a neurochemistry absolutely fucked, and I need to vent this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am often joking about “I’m an anesthesiologist who can put anyone to sleep except myself”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.

&lt;p&gt;I have the ambien for nights where I can’t fall asleep with the seroquel only which is only when my anxiety is really bad because something special is on the next day.  I try to take it as rarely as possible so I don’t get depended. &lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,"I suddenly developed insomnia 5 weeks ago. There were no additional stressors in my life. The only thing I changed was going from a high carb diet to low carb (probably low enough to go into ketosis most days). So  I added more carbs to my diet, but nothing changed. I don't have a lot of stress in my life in general. 

I am NEVER sleepy, and I can NEVER fall asleep naturally. I yawn a little bit, and feel phsyically tired, but it's like my mind is permanently switched on.  My mind feels clear (no racing thoughts) and I don't feel like I have bad anxiety. No history of bipolar/mania. But I have had low level depression for a long time.

Temezepam 10mg never really worked for me (maybe once for a couple of hours). 12.5mg of Ambien CR gave me 4 hours sleep at first, and now it takes a lot longer to kick in, and might give me 2 hours if I am lucky. 

Where do I go from here? Should I try other types of sleeping medication, and if yes which ones? Melatonin just made me feel sleepy.

This feels like a physical problem rather than mental. Any ideas? Does anyone have onset insomnia so bad that they feel like it is impossible to fall asleep naturally? I would really appreciate any advice at all.

This is hell. I feel so sorry for those who have been like this for a long time!

All my joints are stiff, my muscles cramp &amp; my digestive system is shot to bits. I don’t really feel hunger or thirst, if I do its quite sporadic. 

I am a 31 year old male, have always had very professional &amp; responsible jobs prior to this, which has kept me from working. I haven’t had any health issues prior to this &amp; never needed to take any medication for anything.

Since this has happened I have been given every sleeping medication known to man, at the strongest dose with 0 effect. I have been given all of the benzos (made me feel slightly more relaxed short term, head slowed down a bit) then stopped working. I have been given sedative anti depressants, normal antidepressants (I am not depressed, although this situation is extremely disabling &amp; distressing for me).

None of the medications have knocked me out, most have made me feel more high if anything or made me not feel my legs. 

This is not normal. It’s extremely lonely because nobody believes me apart from my ex-girlfriend (I told her she deserves to have a nice life &amp; shouldnt have to deal with this, as she was getting upset I am not the big strong guy she met) she has seen me awake this whole time, we have been away places but every setting is the same. 

Doctors, mental health teams, psychologists, psychiatrists - they have ran physical tests such as cushings, adrenal tumours &amp; and brain scan back in March this year which showed no abnormalities, they have discharged me from their services. With a referral to CFS/ME department in Bath RUH next month. I am chronically fatigued because I haven’t slept, I do not feel this is the cause.

But come on, this is so terrifying seeing &amp; feeling like this, its like everything in my body is malfunctioning, I get a racing heart, adrenaline surges, burning in my stomach &amp; throat, sweats in random parts of my body.

Surly theres a specialist somewhere that would be interested in studying this case, even if it could help someone else?

,insomnia,"With insomnia it seems that people who struggle with it once have reoccurring problems, everyone posting in here it’s never their first rodeo they’ve had multiple bouts of it and know what they are in for.

It’s normally because people are poor sleepers their whole life and it’s habit, maybe genetics a lot of the time, “night owls”. 

For me I don’t associate with any of these things, it’s weird I ever even experienced insomnia, my sleep hygiene has been on point for years, growing up I never had issues, it’s not in my family to have issues.

Then suddenly one day I just didn’t sleep for a week, forced on with anxiety, adrenaline and panic attacks. 

I thought I’d never sleep again but then I started to read the book say good night to insomnia and it helped me, I started sleeping again albeit reduced but I stopped reading it, doing the tasks and was complacent with my progress, I was sleeping again, eventually my sleeping pattern will go back to normal I don’t need to keep it up.

Then another stressful period popped up not long after then boom another 4 days 0 sleep, slept half a night for one night then another night with only fleeting moments of sleep.

Most people who have “insomnia” suffer with taking too long to go to sleep or waking up in the night. Maintenace and the other one I don’t remember. The type I have suffered with is hard cold insomnia. NO sleep and for multiple nights. Like wtf never had anything like this ever then twice in a 2 month period this.

Now I think if I had kept up with the book and the methods inside it perhaps I would have dealt better, perhaps I wouldn’t be having troubles now but it is what it is but I can’t say for sure.

I’ll do a weird analogy here because I can’t think of a better one, I guess insomnia is a bit like an elastic band, sometimes you’ll pull it really hard and it won’t break, some won’t break at all but if you break one once it’s broken, it’s broken, you can tape it back together but it’ll always be prone to breaking again if you try pull it.

Is it true do you think? Once someone has experienced insomnia they’re just bound to have it again?

I’m also intrigued, because tbh I hadn’t even had the time to recover from my first episode before my second, do you ever feel normal again? 

Or do you always feel tired and like that sleep debt feeling? Because when you suffer severe 0 sleep episodes of insomnia it’s pretty tough to pay that sleep debt back, it’s gone. But do you ever go back to feeling normal again? The way you did before?

On a different note I know for sure my insomnia is caused by anxiety, adrenaline, hyperarousal.

,insomnia,"Hello everyone,

I am a fellow struggler of sleep maintenance insomnia. In a typical night, I fall asleep around 10:30, and wake up almost every night between 2-3 AM, a lot of times to urinate. After, I cannot shut off my brain and fall back asleep.

A lot of the times I’m thinking about work cause I do have a very stressful job unfortunately. I also have concerning thoughts about my health given I lost my mom to cancer and constantly worry I’m going to die young.

I have experimented with so many supplements and wear my watch to sleep to really track my deep sleep. I struggle with anxiety, and I used to also be a long time marijuana smoker. I took a 4 month break thinking maybe my anxiety would get better, but damn was I wrong.

When I initially quit smoking weed, I was getting deep sleep numbers somewhere in the 20-40 minute range. I tried numerous supplements to help get those numbers up, but none of the following helped:

- lemon balm
- CBD/CBN
- Magnesium glycinate - still take this for the other benefits but wasn’t a fix
- Dill seed
- L theanine
- Chamomile - makes me urinate more frequently
- Tart cherry extract - some bad deep sleep numbers when I started this
- Valerian Root
- Reishi
- Apigen


I also consider myself fit and active, and practice the following:
- Sauna
- Exercise almost daily
- some days yoga
- meditate before bed
- Epsom salt baths


The two combo that I found really works for me to shut my brain off at night is the combination of ASHGAWNDA and L-TRYPTOPHAN. These two get me the best deep sleep numbers and I wake up feeling much more refreshed with minimal anxiety. When I take these 2, I get on average 1 hour - 1.5 hours of deep sleep, even if I wake up in the middle of the night.

My only concern is with L-Tryptophan, it mimics serotonin levels and increases them, and I’m afraid of any long term consequences of this

My question for this thread really is, are there any other recommendations, supplementation, etc for someone who struggles with this sleep maintenance insomnia? 

I am a 30 year old male, I lost my mom to cancer when I was 19, and I really want to get this all under control before I start having kids with my wife. Other medical conditions that I have is that I do frequently urinate at night (however I have been evaluated by urologist and they could find nothing wrong with me - I have found specific stretches cause me to urinate more and am convinced I got a pelvic floor injury years ago). I also do struggle from SVT and am considering to get an ablation.

So I'm a mom, my kiddo is 4 months old. I'm also a full time, third-shift employee. And right now my schedule looks like this: 
Work 10:30pm-7am
Watch the kiddo until husband gets home from work and is ready to take over. Roughly from 8am-6:30pm. 
Sleep until 9:30pm.

,insomnia,"So just a few weeks ago I suddenly started getting probably 3-5 hours a night after a health scare. Since then it seemed like I was making progress slowly extending those hours thanks to the sleep coach on YouTube but still would get adrenaline rushes in the later stages of sleep seemingly independent of what I was thinking or feeling. 

I finally found a video that said this type of sleep pattern can sometimes be explained through adrenal fatigue and malnourishment. I’ve always been a 2 meal a day type but after watching Ive added a 3rd full meal a couple hours before bed and slept a full 8 for 3 nights in a row. (Besides last night, partly due to it being Taco Bell)

I don’t want to give you false hope but give it a try if you haven’t, 3 full healthy meals a day (if you can) and continue that for half a year. Remember a good balance between veggies, proteins and carbs, bonus points if you eat them in that order (reduces blood glucose spikes). Check out the vid for further info.

I’ve had insomnia off and on for about 5 years now. I generally have it controlled with medications. I cannot sleep if I know I’m going to be interrupted (I.e., someone coming in the house at 5am will wake me up and I won’t be able to fall back asleep). I anticipate this interruption and can’t get a good night’s sleep. I know this is my fault. I’ve had a death in my family about six months ago therefore it’s difficult to fix issues right now.

We have discussed before about him coming in at about 2-3am on nights that I work so as to lessen my poor sleep. I thought that was a reasonable compromise, he has plenty of time to hang out with friends then. I thought that was it… now we’re going to this party. I’m going to go for a few hours and then he’s going to drop me off at home because I work the day after the party, early in the morning. I asked him to come home earlier (because I work), and he said he wants to stay out until 5-6am if he feels like it and that he can sleep in the guest room. I’m glad he’s not going to be with me but I’m angry that we had this discussion about coming home early and now he’s going back on it. 

What makes me really mad is he has 12-14 hours to hang out with his friends at night and he always tries to extend the time - why do you need to be with your friends for that long? It’s not as if they are long distance, etc. Are you not capable of having a dinner and a few drinks and calling it a night? He acts as if he’s required to stay out that long. This has happened every weekend for the last three weekends and I honestly wonder if we’re even compatible at this point.

So recently, I’ve been struggling a lot with sleep. I’ve had issues with sleep in the past, but over the past few days, it has been much worse than it has ever been. Just two weeks ago, I could fall asleep and get my full 8 hours with no trouble. Now, I'm struggling to close my eyes and fall asleep at all. It all reached a peak last night where I only got about two hours of sleep. It’s making my mind race, and it has me feeling increasingly anxious and scared, to the point where I’m worried I might have a serious condition, like FFI or something else, however unlikely it is, it just starting to become overwhelming.

Any advice on how to handle this? Should I be concerned?

,insomnia,"Well , hello . I’m new to insomnia, been having trouble for the last 2 months sleeping , but the last 2 weeks have been hell . 

I’ve made a few posts every time I was concerned because I’m alone and don’t really have nobody to talk to . 

I work in rotating shifts , this week I’m on night shift . The last 3 days I slept maybe 6 hours all together. The last day it was using Lunesta ( 3mg ) which I used for the first time . I’m usually against sleeping pills , and tend to believe that I actually need anxiety pills because that’s what it’s preventing me from sleeping . Regardless, lunesta calmed me down, gave me hypnotic hallucinations, had a nightmare , woked up in sweat , and slept only 2 hours . 

I’ve had this issue for the last few days , I feel sleepy , I lay in bed , I think about something , and the moment i feel that my mind is wandering off , I panic , get like a wake up signal . I repeat it like 10-15 times, get up and pee ( 3-5 times ) . Go back to bed so I can try again , it happens exactly the same , I make myself somehow so sleepy after work , but can’t get past the losing consciousness part . It’s driving me insane . , also my JAW gets involuntary clinched. ! I’m currently 30 hours awake , and I have to work in 6 hours . I’m scared to take lunesta because I’m afraid it won’t work , and il be just drowsy tonight . 

Today I felt asleep 20 minutes maybe by listening to some sleep meditation , my phone rang . BAM since then I’m wide awake can’t go back to sleep anymore , don’t feel sleepy . Tried to listen to x10 meditations I’m just not calm . 


My question is , how should I approach the hyperawarness before falling asleep? Im home at 6, at 6:30 I’m in bed , I fail to fall asleep 2-3 times , get up and pee , repeat again the process for like 3-4 times more . And then I’m up in the kitchen smoking and going back to bed and repeat all this process . Is there any chance that even if I lay in bed I will eventually sleep ? Isn’t it better to get up from bed ? I’m having thoughts already that I lost the ability to fall asleep on my own .

I tried to approach the feeling of falling asleep like a curiosity, like a friend , sometimes I’m trying to talk to my brain and tell him ,,I know you are doing this to protect me , but there isn’t any danger , we are in bed “ 
But never seem to actually work , the worst part is getting up to pee , and before you ask . I stop drinking water LONG before going to bed .  And then after 1h 1h30 of constantly struggling to surpass the falling asleep process I’m up in the kitchen smoking …should I stay more in bed and struggle ? Right now I know that I should be so tired but I’m awake and can’t sleep . Until Sunday I had such a good sleep hygiene , avoid bed until late night . Watch a Tv show , go out . Right now I’m in bed all the time making myself more anxious

,insomnia,"I thought i'd repost a comment I just made as a question/suggestion, since I know I've never been told this in my entire life: just going to sleep at 5/6/7pm and waking up at 2/3/4am -works- to resolve most of the complaints described here for a long period of time until some stupid social event knocks you off of that schedule. I discovered this by accident years ago and it didn't dawn on me that what I was actually doing was sleeping and waking with the natural sun cycle; sleeping just before dusk (being genuinely tired, and sleep taking no effort) and waking an hour or a few hours before dawn. 

Turns out this was how the Ancient Romans did it as well, with the business day beginning at 6am (meaning they'd have to have been awake at least a few hours before 6am to arrive at the business location) and the work day being basically over by midday (compare the siesta custom) to spend the rest of the day at leisure; having dinner between 12/3 and doing as you please, being naturally tuckered out by around 5/6.

Works like a dream. 

The moment I break this I'm right back into shitty waking up after an hour or two, not being able to sleep, and this grinding on for a week or more feeling less and less energetic and more irritable until I physically force myself back into that routine by staying awake for 24 or 32 hours until I'm actually tired.

So yeah, I relate to 100% of the 50 or so posts I just breezed through on here; have tried everything, am the type that's naturally wired after a busy day and who isn't ""ready for bed"" after having smashed a punch bag into the wall or done some labour but that doing that had the complete opposite effect, tried every herbal tea and over-counter med long ago and found nothing ever worked in the long term or even at all ... apart from this routine which.. while not perfect is only ""not perfect"" due it clashing with social and 9/5 expectations.

Although I should add I did start doing this originally when I was working 9/5, so its perfectly compatible (in theory), it's just a matter of having your evening leisure time in the early morning, being able to show up like a squirrel for your job, and then being actually exhausted enough to sleep by the time you fall through the door in the evening.",[],False,,0,False,sleeping before dusk and waking before dawn,[],r/insomnia,False,,,0,,False,t3_1gawkag,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,{},,True,,1729752863.0,text,,,,self.insomnia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought i&amp;#39;d repost a comment I just made as a question/suggestion, since I know I&amp;#39;ve never been told this in my entire life: just going to sleep at 5/6/7pm and waking up at 2/3/4am -works- to resolve most of the complaints described here for a long period of time until some stupid social event knocks you off of that schedule. I discovered this by accident years ago and it didn&amp;#39;t dawn on me that what I was actually doing was sleeping and waking with the natural sun cycle; sleeping just before dusk (being genuinely tired, and sleep taking no effort) and waking an hour or a few hours before dawn. &lt;/p&gt;

Im having a hard time getting used to wearing a cpap mask.  Every day I struggle with feeling tired and irritable.  Every day around 9:30 am i get so tired and all I want to do is nap.  Ive fallen asleep a few times at 9:30 am for a nap which is rare because of work and parenting.  I also have adhd and take a stimulant (concerta 54 mg) and I dont sleep any better if I dont take my stimulant.  Plus ive been on stimulant for 4 years so clearly its not the cause of my insomnia.  I regularly go 3+ nights in a row of 0-2 hours of sleep.  Maybe 1 night a week i get 6 hours of sleep.  On average i would say i get 2-4 hours of sleep even though im in bed 11pm-7am.  I wake up frequently and have a hard time going back to sleep.  The cpsp mask is causing more frequent wakings because the mask has shifted and then i have to adjust it.  There have been nights where ive taken 2 sleeping pills and i still dont sleep.  Ive tried marijuana edibles and it didnt help me sleep at all.  I feel like my entire life os focused on sleep.

""What can i do to get good sleep tonight""  ""what drug cocktail will work for sleep?""

,insomnia,"Hey everyone! I'm struggling to fall asleep and adjust my sleep schedule.

,insomnia,"Hello guys, I need some help here. I'm 31m, never had too much trouble getting at least 6 hours of sleep. But something have just changed this week.

On Sunday after. A couple of days of sickness, I started feeling trembling, I thought might be stress as last week was awfull (huge layoffs on the office, but I was informed that I will keep my job last Thursday, so I don't know if that would still stick) and I couldn't get to sleep until 3 in the morning, waking up at 6. 

Just a bad night I thought, but next day it repeated itself, no trembling, just a general inability to fall sleep, even after a melatonin pill and a relaxing tea of camonile. Yesterday I came to my house after a day out, went straight to bed at 9 and fell sleep quite quickly, and went for a full night.

I thought it was fixed, but nothing as far from reality, here I am, 4:30, worse than any other day, I wake up at 6 and I still can't sleep. This has never happened to me before. Is like  yawning, close my eyes, and my feet and arms start to feel hot, like it's 30C, and I just can't. I've been completely out of my bed, more than an hour with my eyes closed, nothing, is like I forgot how does one sleep. I don't have stress this week, not more than what I had a month ago.

A couple of days of sickness, I started feeling trembling, I thought might be stress as last week was awfull (huge layoffs on the office, but I was informed that I will keep my job last Thursday, so I don&amp;#39;t know if that would still stick) and I couldn&amp;#39;t get to sleep until 3 in the morning, waking up at 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a bad night I thought, but next day it repeated itself, no trembling, just a general inability to fall sleep, even after a melatonin pill and a relaxing tea of camonile. Yesterday I came to my house after a day out, went straight to bed at 9 and fell sleep quite quickly, and went for a full night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was fixed, but nothing as far from reality, here I am, 4:30, worse than any other day, I wake up at 6 and I still can&amp;#39;t sleep. This has never happened to me before. Is like  yawning, close my eyes, and my feet and arms start to feel hot, like it&amp;#39;s 30C, and I just can&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ve been completely out of my bed, more than an hour with my eyes closed, nothing, is like I forgot how does one sleep. I don&amp;#39;t have stress this week, not more than what I had a month ago. I don&amp;#39;t see what&amp;#39;s the reason, but once I close my eyes, is like my head wants to do whatever but sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can this change so suddenly? Any tips or ideas that I can try? Or in general, what should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,"Hi guys, 

I have anxiety and also insomnia, and it's been a year this month since I started having insomnia. Since then, I was prescribed 50mg of trazodone. I've been taking it, sometimes 25mg, other times 100mg or 50mg, varying between these doses. The trazodone puts me to sleep, but I end up waking up every 2 hours and feel tired when I wake up to go to work.

At the pharmacy, they recommended several natural supplements, but the effect was mainly drowsiness during the night, and I still woke up feeling tired.

So I tried PlexusVita G47 Sleep:

* California Poppy - 200 mg
* Cyracos® - 150 mg (never tried it)
* GABA - 150 mg (never tried it)
* Hops - 100 mg (never tried it)
* Melatonin - 1 mg

I slept better, woke up fewer times, and felt more energized, but I still have ups and downs.

Then I saw this supplement NOW Foods, Sleep, Botanical Sleep Blend:

* 600mg Valerian Root
* 200mg Passionflower
* 200mg GABA
* 300mg Hops and other plants.

My question is whether I can take 50mg of trazodone and try this supplement? Or could there be a problem with serotonin syndrome due to these plants, especially valerian root? Can someone help me?

,insomnia,"tl;dr: I'm a longterm insomniac that has been in therapy for nearly 2 years but is still struggling a lot because of the physical impact of sleep deprivation. What to do about dizziness, headaches and all that?

Hello everyone, I have been an insomniac (non physiological) for six years now and have been following CBT therapy with a really nice therapist since last year. She helped me out tremendously as I refrained from taking part in social life more and more  – I was just always mega tired, waiting for that *one* night of ok sleep that then allowed me to do something with friends, do sports, tackle an important task during the day etc. ...  I basically thought I'm not good enough, can't concentrate well enough, am not happy enough, not witty enough, too slow to engage in just about anything involving other people. Stuff that was meant to be fun, like roadtrips, became daunting as hell because I knew I couldn't drive a car. Or I couldn't make conversation with a friend. I would get stressed not one night before a drive, but two or more. And that's not even mentioning work obligations like meetings and stuff (I worked as a lecturer in a university during my therapy and basically did every seminar I had to give on no sleep and then evaluated it as a terrible failure. In reality the feedback the students gave me at the end of a term was completely fine, not amazing, but nowhere near what I thought it was).

Now! A LOT of that is a thing of the past. The first thing I was taught was that I could still do all of these things. I was in disbelief but my therapist was right! After one of the sessions where she introduced that idea, I couldn't sleep but had the plan to go to a bike-park with friends the next day. Usually I'd have cancelled that at like 5am texting people ""sry can't sleep again"", but I trusted her and pushed through the day. I had to take a nap when we got there (drove 1.5h) but the adrenaline kept me going all day and I was so happy back home that something changed in my mental structure, for good. I just do most things I want or have to do now and thereby slowly moved out of my depression.

So far so good, sadly that does not imply that my sleep is fixed – something I really hoped for. I keep having this thought: I have learned so much, I am in therapy, I overcame extreme sadness, I don't let insomnia ruin my life, I'm not catching up on sleep past my wake up time, why the f are you still anxious when you go to bed? What is left to do? Literally every night I have physical reactions in bed like a tight chest and shallow breathing and I tell myself over and over again ""It's okay to have these feelings, they will pass, don't fight them"" and eventually it works but usually very late. So I'm still constantly sleep deprived. And every night I ask myself ""How long is it gonna take this time?"" I mean why the hell if I know that I can function on no sleep would this still affect me?

Now that brings me to my actual question. I do experience a lot of symptoms like brain fog, tension headaches, dizziness and eye pain – fearing this plethora of pain the night before is probably one of the reasons I still struggle. Do you have any recommendations on how to cope with that? I'm trying to keep it in check with Ibuprofen but it's just too intense. My work currently means looking at a screen 8h a day so I just sit here and get super wound up by all these physical cues. I swear my brain is able to function and I know there're bits of the day where the fog goes away and suddenly I am very productive and stuff but this gets in my way time and time again because it's so distracting. And I feel the sadness creeping back up because I just wish I wouldn't have to deal with this BS. What helps you guys in this situation? Also do you still do sports when experiencing these headaches etc.?

,insomnia,"# TL;DR:

I've had sleep issues since childhood, which have worsened into severe chronic insomnia over the past two years, leaving me with 0-3 hours of sleep per night. I consistently wake up around 2-3 AM, and despite trying numerous sleep aids, none have provided lasting relief without significant side effects.

I also take dextroamphetamine for ADHD, which may slightly impact my sleep, but even unmedicated, I struggle to sleep more than 4 hours. I've tried almost all available insomnia medications in my country, but nothing has fully resolved the issue. I need to remain medicated for ADHD as I’m pursuing a demanding university degree, and going without medication severely affects my daily functioning. Despite maintaining good sleep hygiene and trying various treatments, I haven't found a long-term solution.

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

**Full post:**

I am a student in my 20:s reaching out in the hope that someone may have suggestions or ideas that can help me in any way with my insomnia..

Since childhood, I have struggled with sleep problems. In my early years, this manifested as difficulty falling asleep, often taking 1-2 hours, along with short sleep duration. For many years, I believed this was normal, but my condition has worsened over time. In the last two years, I have developed severe chronic insomnia, during which I manage only 0-3 hours of sleep per night. Regardless of sleep aids, I consistently wake up between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. I never experience natural sleepiness; every night, it feels as though my eyes are wide open and I am painfully alert, despite being severely sleep-deprived.

I have tried most available sleep aids, but they have been largely ineffective and often come with undesirable side effects.

Unfortunately, the healthcare system in my country offers limited support for cases like mine. Doctors here can only provide general recommendations, and it is not possible to consult specialists in sleep disorders or specific diagnoses. Healthcare is regionally provided and government-funded, for which I am very grateful, but it also means I have limited access to more specialized expertise.

In addition to my sleep issues, I am diagnosed with ADHD and currently take dextroamphetamine to manage it. I was previously prescribed methylphenidate, but it caused significant side effects related to elevated norepinephrine levels, and at lower doses, it was ineffective in treating inattentiveness. I later switched to Vyvanse, which effectively managed my ADHD, but the 30 mg dose only lasted about three hours before I experienced a comedown. As a result, I now take 7.5 mg of immediate-release dextroamphetamine 3-4 times a day, providing coverage from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, as the effects last only about two and a half hours. Unfortunately, I experience a severe crash every evening, but lower doses are ineffective, which creates a challenge.

While I acknowledge that my ADHD medication likely impacts my sleep, even when I am unmedicated, I cannot sleep more than six hours, even with the aid of zopiclone.

The core issue is that I need medication to manage my ADHD, as I am pursuing a degree that is generally regarded as difficult. With medication, I find my studies enjoyable and fulfilling, but without it, I struggle with even basic daily executive functions.

I case it is of any importance I take 1.25 mg of finasteride every other day for hair loss.

I have eliminated caffeine, maintain good sleep hygiene, and use a weighted blanket. I have also tried numerous sleep aids, as listed below:

# Sleep Aids and Their Results:

1. [**Melatonin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin) **(1-10 mg)**
   * **Receptors**: MT1 and MT2 receptors
   * Helped slightly with sleep onset but did not prevent middle-of-the-night awakenings.
2. [**Promethazine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promethazine)
   * **Receptors**: H1 receptor (antagonist), M1 receptor (anticholinergic)
   * No improvement in sleep. Caused leg jerks and confusion at higher doses.
3. [**Propiomazine (Propavan)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propiomazine) (6.25-25 mg)
   * **Receptors**: H1 receptor (antagonist), D2 receptor (antagonist), 5-HT2A receptor (antagonist)
   * Even at low doses, I experienced severe cognitive impairment the following day. Occasionally, it provided 2-3 additional hours of sleep.
4. [**Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenhydramine) (20-75 mg)
   * **Receptors**: H1 receptor (antagonist), M1 receptor (anticholinergic)
   * Did not help with sleep at all.
5. [**Quetiapine (Seroquel)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetiapine) (6.25-25 mg)
   * **Receptors**: H1 receptor (antagonist), 5-HT2A receptor (antagonist), D2 receptor (antagonist), α1 receptor (antagonist)
   * Gave me 2-3 additional hours of sleep but caused cognitive and memory problems, and made my ADHD medication ineffective.
6. [**Mirtazapine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtazapine) (1.875-15 mg)
   * **Receptors**: 5-HT2A/2C, 5-HT3 receptor (antagonist), H1 receptor (antagonist), α2 receptor (antagonist)
   * Provided 3 more hours of sleep but caused cognitive, memory issues, and weight gain, rendering ADHD medication ineffective.

The only medication that consistently prevents middle-of-the-night awakenings is zopiclone.

In summary, I have tried nearly every available medication for insomnia in my country. The only remaining options are clonidine and doxepin, but given their similarities to medications I’ve already tried (guanfacine and trazodone/amitriptyline), I am uncertain whether they will offer any improvement.

Hopefully there is a medicine combination that treats my ADHD and provides sufficient sleep without causing cognitive, memory issues the following day.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions, as I feel I have exhausted all known alternatives.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had sleep issues since childhood, which have worsened into severe chronic insomnia over the past two years, leaving me with 0-3 hours of sleep per night. I consistently wake up around 2-3 AM, and despite trying numerous sleep aids, none have provided lasting relief without significant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also take dextroamphetamine for ADHD, which may slightly impact my sleep, but even unmedicated, I struggle to sleep more than 4 hours. I&amp;#39;ve tried almost all available insomnia medications in my country, but nothing has fully resolved the issue. I need to remain medicated for ADHD as I’m pursuing a demanding university degree, and going without medication severely affects my daily functioning. Despite maintaining good sleep hygiene and trying various treatments, I haven&amp;#39;t found a long-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full post:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a student in my 20:s reaching out in the hope that someone may have suggestions or ideas that can help me in any way with my insomnia..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since childhood, I have struggled with sleep problems. In my early years, this manifested as difficulty falling asleep, often taking 1-2 hours, along with short sleep duration. For many years, I believed this was normal, but my condition has worsened over time. In the last two years, I have developed severe chronic insomnia, during which I manage only 0-3 hours of sleep per night. Regardless of sleep aids, I consistently wake up between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. I never experience natural sleepiness; every night, it feels as though my eyes are wide open and I am painfully alert, despite being severely sleep-deprived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried most available sleep aids, but they have been largely ineffective and often come with undesirable side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the healthcare system in my country offers limited support for cases like mine. Doctors here can only provide general recommendations, and it is not possible to consult specialists in sleep disorders or specific diagnoses. Healthcare is regionally provided and government-funded, for which I am very grateful, but it also means I have limited access to more specialized expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to my sleep issues, I am diagnosed with ADHD and currently take dextroamphetamine to manage it. I was previously prescribed methylphenidate, but it caused significant side effects related to elevated norepinephrine levels, and at lower doses, it was ineffective in treating inattentiveness. I later switched to Vyvanse, which effectively managed my ADHD, but the 30 mg dose only lasted about three hours before I experienced a comedown. As a result, I now take 7.5 mg of immediate-release dextroamphetamine 3-4 times a day, providing coverage from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, as the effects last only about two and a half hours. Unfortunately, I experience a severe crash every evening, but lower doses are ineffective, which creates a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I acknowledge that my ADHD medication likely impacts my sleep, even when I am unmedicated, I cannot sleep more than six hours, even with the aid of zopiclone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core issue is that I need medication to manage my ADHD, as I am pursuing a degree that is generally regarded as difficult. With medication, I find my studies enjoyable and fulfilling, but without it, I struggle with even basic daily executive functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I case it is of any importance I take 1.25 mg of finasteride every other day for hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have eliminated caffeine, maintain good sleep hygiene, and use a weighted blanket. I have also tried numerous sleep aids, as listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,"I know the title reads like an article but I just wanted to share my experience.   So here's my story so far.  It's long and there's no tl;dr because it's a story and the details might help someone.

I am 50 and hormonally I am in the perimenopause phase but I am technically in menopause because I haven't had a period since I was 35 due to getting an endometrial ablation.

I've always been someone who didn't require a lot of sleep, since I was small.  My dad is the same, though he's the type to go to bed early and then wake up super early and I am a night owl, which I get from my mom.  All the way into my late thirties I was fine with 5 hours of sleep a night and if I had a couple nights of less, not due to insomnia but do to work travel or work projects or a sick child, etc, I was fine.

But, beginning in my very early 40s I started having trouble with both primary and secondary insomnia, with secondary insomnia being the biggest problem.  I started only getting 3 hours of sleep a night.  Once my marriage of 20+ years broke down I turned to alcohol, which ultimately made things worse.  As my mental health improved and I began unlinking from the dependence upon alcohol I realized my brain had totally reconditioned from any good sleep chemistry and I started with the primary insomnia.

For instance, I still drink socially on the weekends.  Of course, it SEEMS like I get a full night's sleep those nights but we all know that's not true due to the impact of alcohol on REM, etc.  So, Monday rolls around and I have primary insomnia.  Often again on Tuesday.  And I mean ZERO sleep those nights. By Wednesday I am tired enough that I fall asleep, but 3 hours later I am wide awake.  Same on Thursday, etc.

The first thing my doctor and I tried was progesterone.  While it helped with OTHER perimenopausal things it did not help with sleep.  Of course, I tried magnesium and melatonin and cava and other sleep supplements.  The Calm drink mix would often help with the primary insomnia but not the secondary.  That being said, I do find it very helpful in my international travel to expediate recovery from jet lag.  We're talking 8-12 hour time differences.  So, I still use it for that.

On my own, without a doctor's supervision, I tried gabapentin and trazadone.  This is where you should roll your eyes HARD and let out a heavy sigh of disapproval - these were medications Rx'd to my DOG for the anxiety she had during storms/fireworks (my beloved Fisher passed away in August, of cancer, at age 7).  Gabapentin did nothing.  Trazadone at full 100mg just about made me into a zombie the next day.  I could NOT get up the next day and had to call in sick the one time I tried it.  50mg seemed to work okay.  But after reading up on it I felt it wasn't going to help me get my brain back to good sleep ""chemistry"", for lack of a better term.  I will reserve it for times when it might be more appropriate, like getting sleep on a long flight, like the 14 hour one to Seoul or the 16 hour one to Johannesburg.

Last month my doctor Rx'd me Belsomra.  I can't take Ambien and the like due to a history of sleep-walking.  I was initially Rx'd 10mg.  I got the manufacturer's coupon to bring the price down to $80 for 30 pills.  10mg did nothing for me.  Talking to my doctor we agree I should try to double it.  20mg in 2 10mg tablets worked!

And it seems to be working the more often I used it.  The first couple of times I tried it I felt myself getting drowsy within 30 minutes, went to bed, and I would fall asleep immediately.  I was still waking up too early but getting in an extra hour.

After a good week on 20mg I found that even when I would come to some wakefulness after 4 hours it was pretty easy to go back to sleep because my mind would not immediately start engaging in buzzing thoughts and other mindful/thought-based activity.  And I would sleep another couple hours.  After a total of 6 hours I would come to a wakefulness where my brain/mind would engage and after about 10-20 minutes or so I would realize that it was just time to get up.

I would feel a little groggy, but a cup of coffee would clear that away.

Now I find myself having 4-5 nights of what I call pretty damn good sleep.

But, I have had a few quirky ""side-effects"" that don't really bother me.  

The first is that I have a few jump-starts as I fall asleep.  Not the type where you feel like you're falling and you jump at the end/bottom.  Just these strong involuntary body jerks.  They're pretty strong, too.  But they don't pull me out of falling asleep.  My boyfriend, who likes to sleep all rooted up against my back, has commented on them.  They happen 1-3 times as I am initially falling asleep but not in the middle of sleep.

The second is some really vivid dreams that I can remember when I wake up. Nothing nuts or scary, just vivid.  Often mundane, to the point I am, like, wait...is that a memory or a dream?

The third is a state of lucid sleeping where I either do hear things going on around me (often get incorporated into the vivid dream) or I fully hallucinate the noise.  

The most prominent and common one is this:  My adult son lives with me.  He's a professional photographer and often does shoots of concert events and other things that keep him out late.  So he will sometimes not come home and just stay at his girlfriend's place or with a friend.  But a few times I absolutely heard him come into the house, tool around in the kitchen putting together a snack, and going into his room.  To get into our place, which is a warehouse loft conversion, you have to come through an iron gate to the patio and then through the front door, both which need to be shut forcefully in order to shut, so they're loud.  The kitchen and his bedroom are essentially below mine so any activity in the kitchen is clear from my room and when he goes into his room he has to open and shut a sliding door, which makes a distinctive moderately loud noise on its own.  I will hear ALL of that!  But the one thing that clues me into it being a hallucination?  My other dog, Norm...no sound from him. He's a 100lb Doberman and whenever my son DOES come home he's absolutely getting up, scratching at the front door as my son crosses the patio, running in excited circles around, etc.  His typical reaction to my son coming home is never part of the hallucination.  So, that's how I've learned to discern it.  And I am guessing since it's a pattern of noises that's part of my daily life that's why it manifests to begin with.

Anyway, my doctor Rx'd me the 20mg.  My insurance denied it initially.  They would only cover 30 pills a YEAR.  But she was able to get that waived and now it's a little over $100 for 30 pills/month.  I don't take it every day since I do still socially drink so 30 pills last me longer than a month.

For the first time in years I feel like I am feeling more like my old self.  If this long-ass story helps anyone, I would be thrilled!  My biggest lesson was to let the medication take a few tries to ""work with my brain"" and help it ""relearn"" the way it's supposed to sleep.  To be patient.

&lt;p&gt;And it seems to be working the more often I used it.  The first couple of times I tried it I felt myself getting drowsy within 30 minutes, went to bed, and I would fall asleep immediately.  I was still waking up too early but getting in an extra hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a good week on 20mg I found that even when I would come to some wakefulness after 4 hours it was pretty easy to go back to sleep because my mind would not immediately start engaging in buzzing thoughts and other mindful/thought-based activity.  And I would sleep another couple hours.  After a total of 6 hours I would come to a wakefulness where my brain/mind would engage and after about 10-20 minutes or so I would realize that it was just time to get up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would feel a little groggy, but a cup of coffee would clear that away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I find myself having 4-5 nights of what I call pretty damn good sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I have had a few quirky &amp;quot;side-effects&amp;quot; that don&amp;#39;t really bother me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that I have a few jump-starts as I fall asleep.  Not the type where you feel like you&amp;#39;re falling and you jump at the end/bottom.  Just these strong involuntary body jerks.  They&amp;#39;re pretty strong, too.  But they don&amp;#39;t pull me out of falling asleep.  My boyfriend, who likes to sleep all rooted up against my back, has commented on them.  They happen 1-3 times as I am initially falling asleep but not in the middle of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is some really vivid dreams that I can remember when I wake up. Nothing nuts or scary, just vivid.  Often mundane, to the point I am, like, wait...is that a memory or a dream?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third is a state of lucid sleeping where I either do hear things going on around me (often get incorporated into the vivid dream) or I fully hallucinate the noise.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most prominent and common one is this:  My adult son lives with me.  He&amp;#39;s a professional photographer and often does shoots of concert events and other things that keep him out late.  So he will sometimes not come home and just stay at his girlfriend&amp;#39;s place or with a friend.  But a few times I absolutely heard him come into the house, tool around in the kitchen putting together a snack, and going into his room.  To get into our place, which is a warehouse loft conversion, you have to come through an iron gate to the patio and then through the front door, both which need to be shut forcefully in order to shut, so they&amp;#39;re loud.  The kitchen and his bedroom are essentially below mine so any activity in the kitchen is clear from my room and when he goes into his room he has to open and shut a sliding door, which makes a distinctive moderately loud noise on its own.  I will hear ALL of that!  But the one thing that clues me into it being a hallucination?  My other dog, Norm...no sound from him. He&amp;#39;s a 100lb Doberman and whenever my son DOES come home he&amp;#39;s absolutely getting up, scratching at the front door as my son crosses the patio, running in excited circles around, etc.  His typical reaction to my son coming home is never part of the hallucination.  So, that&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;ve learned to discern it.  And I am guessing since it&amp;#39;s a pattern of noises that&amp;#39;s part of my daily life that&amp;#39;s why it manifests to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my doctor Rx&amp;#39;d me the 20mg.  My insurance denied it initially.  They would only cover 30 pills a YEAR.  But she was able to get that waived and now it&amp;#39;s a little over $100 for 30 pills/month.  I don&amp;#39;t take it every day since I do still socially drink so 30 pills last me longer than a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in years I feel like I am feeling more like my old self.  If this long-ass story helps anyone, I would be thrilled!  My biggest lesson was to let the medication take a few tries to &amp;quot;work with my brain&amp;quot; and help it &amp;quot;relearn&amp;quot; the way it&amp;#39;s supposed to sleep.  To be patient.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve had insomnia my entire life but have been able to sleep well enough since being hired. I have been insanely stressed lately due to financial issues and family stuff which has caused me to become severely depressed and a bit suicidal. I had a mental breakdown at work last week after being told by my dentist that I need almost 10k in dental work. My workplace is extremely supportive and accommodating. I talked to basically every higher up about my breakdown for support and advice and I felt a lot better since.

Im not sure why but I randomly couldn’t sleep last night and was basically delirious all day today. I work with prescription medications and it’s very important for me not to fuck up. There’s a lot of checks in place after my work is done so that a fuck up is usually caught but I’m obviously still held liable if I cause a major screw up. Thankfully I only made very minor mistakes that only affected coworkers and wouldn’t have caused issue for a patient. But I’m very very non functional if I get less than 6 hours of sleep per day and I’m so fucking scared to go in tomorrow but I feel like I have to. I have an immunodeficiency and had to call out for a day last week due to being too fatigued and sick after  getting Covid shot at work. My work isl supportive of all call outs for legitimate reasons and I have a fantastic relationship with my supervisor but I obviously don’t want to take advantage of her kindness and call out tomorrow since it will be my 5th call out in 2 months.

After that incident a new psychiatrist wanted to prescribe it to me, and I refused. She tried to force me to take it saying it was my only option bc I tried everything else. When I said that nothing would make me take trazadone again after nearly dying She forced me to take olanzapine instrad which made me gain 80lbs in 3 months and threatened to drop me as a patient when I tried to refuse when she said it had significant weight gain side effects.

It got to a point I was asleep by 8pm up at 730am and struggling to get home eventually I stopped driving to school because of how fatigued I was. For a week of the month the pain would keep me awake. I would read a lot to distract myself. Back then I had no idea what was wrong, I knew something wasn't really right and so did my mum. 

Mum took me to several doctors, private and public but all I was told was get used to it. 

I'm 26 years old now and for 5 years I haven't had a good night sleep. My pain got worse and more frequent. I moved away for university and while I finished, graduated and got a good job in my field I was burnt out and all I was doing was working and attempting to sleep. I lost my job and the stress of finding another, paying my bills and watching my savings go down was so hard. I have a large mortgage my dad started helping me with. The guilt I feel for not being independent like I always was kept me awake. Then it happened my first epileptic seizures back to back. 2 in my sleep, one after breakfast another at the hospital. The fear, the dread, the unknown is giving me nightmares and I'm terrified I'll never have a normal life. I want to go back to selling art and creating. 
The Sims and baldurs gate have been my distraction from life. I needed to vent it's 1pm and I can't sleep. I feel silly being so afraid.

,insomnia,"I've taken Quetiapine on and off for almost twenty years now. I've always struggled with insomnia, since being a child. Later in life I was diagnosed with bipolar, and prescribed Quetiapine at high doses. I never really felt it helped with my bipolarity, but it definitely knocks me out like nothing else ever has.

After cycling through many different antidepressants, I've eventually landed on Phenelzine, a very old school medication from the MAOI class. It literally makes every other antidepressant I've ever taken (and I've taken most of them) look like a joke, it's incredibly efficient. However, it does come with infamous insomnia.

My doctor put me back on a low dose of Quetiapine to counteract this. Around 50mg is the lowest I can get away with, any higher than this I get a very congested nose which drives me mad as I'm falling asleep, and then drives anyone in the room mad after I've fallen asleep with my snoring.

My real pet hatred regarding Quetiapine though is that it makes me ridiculously hungry just as I'm beginning to feel tired, specifically for sugar and carbs. The cravings are overwhelming. Even when I push through them, sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night in a fugue state and go raid the kitched without really realizing it. I've tried not keeping much food, specifically carby or sugary stuff in the house, but I will literally eat anything sometimes.

The weirdest part is that on nights where I can't sleep, after eating something, it actually helps me nod off immediately - as if it's actually improving the efficacy of the Quetiapine. The problem is then the quality of the sleep itself is not restorative, as my stomach is trying to digest food whilst asleep, and I often forget to brush my teeth again in a such sedated state - which is gross especially if I just ate something sugary.

Has anyone else had this issue or found a solution to it? If you didn't what did you change to that worked as well for you? Mirtazapine has exactly the same effect for me.

,insomnia,"Hi good evening.
I’ve had worsening insomnia over the past few years.
Currently, for sleep, I take:
200-500mg Seroquel
(note: I usually start with 200-300mg then take 100 mg as needed til I fall asleep)

100 mg Seroquel XR
300 mg Gabapentin
100 mg Trazodone

I also drink a Neurocalm Magnesium drink about 30 mins before bed.

I have found that getting to sleep is the hardest part. My sleep hygiene is pretty “by the book” - I wear a sleep mask, I keep the room dark and cool, I’ll listen to guided sleep meditations or calming music, I don’t eat large meals before bed, etc. I also don’t spend much time in bed - I don’t take naps, but occasionally I’ll rest in bed for an hour if my back hurts etc. 

I usually take my medications around 9-10pm. On a good day, I’ll fall asleep around 12-2am. On the more difficult days, I fall asleep around 3-5am.

My husband has suggested maybe trying Ambien or a similar Z drug, however my insomnia is more chronic so I’m not sure how much that would help, and I don’t want to become dependent on (another) medication.

I recently had an in-person sleep study done, and I’m hoping to get the results back in a few days. I may have sleep apnea. Either way, the issue is /falling/ asleep, not staying asleep.

My anxiety is insane when it comes time to sleep. It’s like my brain just doesn’t shut off. I think of things like to-do lists, movies or shows I want to watch, hobbies I want to try, creating work out plans and meal plans, you get the idea. 

During the day, I am often exhausted all day then as soon as I get in bed, I’m anxious and my brain is just going.

Does anyone have any advice? I plan to talk to my psychiatrist to address this. My appt is next week but I’ll likely call tomorrow to get a sooner appt.

Oh, I’m 28F btw.

&lt;p&gt;I have found that getting to sleep is the hardest part. My sleep hygiene is pretty “by the book” - I wear a sleep mask, I keep the room dark and cool, I’ll listen to guided sleep meditations or calming music, I don’t eat large meals before bed, etc. I also don’t spend much time in bed - I don’t take naps, but occasionally I’ll rest in bed for an hour if my back hurts etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually take my medications around 9-10pm. On a good day, I’ll fall asleep around 12-2am. On the more difficult days, I fall asleep around 3-5am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband has suggested maybe trying Ambien or a similar Z drug, however my insomnia is more chronic so I’m not sure how much that would help, and I don’t want to become dependent on (another) medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had an in-person sleep study done, and I’m hoping to get the results back in a few days. I may have sleep apnea. Either way, the issue is /falling/ asleep, not staying asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My anxiety is insane when it comes time to sleep. It’s like my brain just doesn’t shut off. I think of things like to-do lists, movies or shows I want to watch, hobbies I want to try, creating work out plans and meal plans, you get the idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day, I am often exhausted all day then as soon as I get in bed, I’m anxious and my brain is just going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any advice? I plan to talk to my psychiatrist to address this. My appt is next week but I’ll likely call tomorrow to get a sooner appt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I’m 28F btw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,"I have been suffering from sleep disorder since last Friday. I at least have to wait until 5 or 5.30 until I finally fall asleep badly.

Here I will try to tell everything in my mind and hopefully I could get some pieces of advice. I’m from Japan so lemme try my best 

So I had been sleeping very well, at least I could sleep, despite the bad quality sometimes, I at least managed to sleep whenever I wanted to. But things changed since last Friday, or maybe more exact, since I have tried taking in supplement of melatonin(which is already expired) 

So there was one night, maybe last week I guess(? I failed to fall asleep, the first thing that came to my mind was a bottle of melatonin supplement, which I had never consumed before. So despite the fact that it was already one day after the expiration day, I took one and yea not surprisingly I had a great sleep. Since then I would take one whenever there are important stuff in the following day so as to maintain the sleep quality. It worked well, and because I was afraid that I may kind of “rely” on the supplement if I use it daily, I would just not  it if it’s not necessary. It was still fine, I had been sleeping great with it and without it. 

And now no matter I choose to take it or not, I just cannot sleep 

I have to admit one thing, i am a very irregular sleeper like I sometimes sleep at 3 sometimes at 4 or even at 6. And I usually take nap at night for like at least one hour. And if there isn’t any schedule the next day, I will sleep until 2pm or even 4pm.

I am glad that I actually have already developed a good attitude towards insomnia, I don’t mind and I am fine with the fine that I couldn’t sleep but just, my goal is to be a singer I practise everyday, without sufficient rest what’s the point of practising right.

Then the third thing I also considered, is the fact that I may have accumulated too many stress? Thankfully I cried hard yesterday and I was really relieved, but still, can’t sleep 

And then, I started trying to adjust my sleeping schedule or like pre-sleep routine? 

I won’t have any contact with any electronic devices one hour before my sleep and during that one hour I usually just play piano. But yea, can’t sleep

Today, I also started doing sports like basketball during daytime hopefully it works but it didn’t

Also Im not sure about whether I should stop taking melatonin or not but for now I will still have one first 

The only thing I am really considering the main causes now are, 

1) poor sleeping schedule takes time to adjust
2) takes time to recover from using supplement 


Also just in case when I’m lying on bed trying to sleep, usually after the presleep routine my brain is literally really really empty, I think of nothing and my body relaxes but yea just I can’t sleep

,insomnia,"Hello everyone,

Writing a post here to ask for some advice, for those who may have gotten through similar events. Sorry for my english as it’s not my first language.


8 months ago I lived a very strong emotionnal shock. The following night of this shock I lost the desire to sleep and had a sleepless night. I didn’t think too much of it, but the next nights I still didn’t feel the desire to sleep and had the impression to stay awake all night long (when I probably got a few hours here and there). 

I grew more and more tired (but without feeling the sensation of being tired, if it makes sense ?) with the weeks going as I never felt again the desire to sleep, and never felt the sensation of being rested. 

For these last 8 months, I only felt the desire to sleep ONE night. So i’m basically living a nightmare.

I tried many complements : magnesium bisglycinate, iron, B vitamins, ashwagandha, zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D, niacin, selenium, valerian, chamomile, essential oils, CBD, even alcohol, accupressure which along with lavender oil on my wrists were the only two things that helped me get each one or two 5 hours nights, but the effect stopped after. Those complements didn’t change anything sadly.

For the first 6 months I probably slept between 1 and 3 hours each night at best (with no more than 1H30 of consecutive sleep). I got a few nights at 6 hours when I took a combinaison of stilnox (hypnotic) + lexomil (benzodiazepine anxiolytic) but I had to stop taking them because they were making me so feeble that I was even having trouble walking, and speaking normally. And even with them I never ever felt again the feeling of a resting night or falling asleep.

But these last two months, my already jerky sleep is deteriorating, i’m not having these 30/60/max 90 minutes « sleep » anymore, as I’m having only having 5 to 15 minutes « sleeps » (my boyfriend stayed awake to make sure how much time I was sleeping). 
I have no more energy (even tho I still don’t feel tired), and feel like my body won’t hold this rythmn much longer. In 8 months I only felt the need to sleep one night, never had a full night sleep and never felt the feeling of being rested.

I’ve seen many different specialists (even a sleep specialist who basically advised me to go run to feel better when at the time I saw him I could barely walk due to fatigue + the sleep medication), but all of them found nothing wrong with me as all the tests/medical exams showed nothing.

Also, after the first few weeks of total loss of desire to sleep, I became totally anxious. And to this day there is not one day or night where I didn’t feel anxious 100% of the time (except this one night where I had the desire to sleep). I’m constantly afraid of death at this point, and even of going to Hell (I even got a few nightmares about it even tho I never ever thought about this topic in my entire life).

I’m feeling like I’m in a never ending cicle where I don’t accept this situation and the mental and physical state I’m in (because I always slept like a baby, was always super positive and dynamic and now I am the shadow of myself, I can’t run because I have no energy, I recently graduated but I can’t practice my job because of focusing problems and lack of sleep..) but at the same I’ve lost any hope about how I could get out of it. 


For those of you who had chronic insomnia for a long time, lost the desire to sleep, or slept up to very few hours per night, how did you manage to get out of your situation ? From recovering your desire to sleep, succeeding in sleeping for longer periods of managing to decrease your stress/anxiety ? I’m basically open to everything (natural stuff, therapies, original ideas, just what worked for you) but I’m afraid of sleep/anxiety medication because I don’t want to be dependent on them and because of the horrible state they already put me in.

,insomnia,"I’ve heard mixed opinions on sleep restriction as a technique. Regardless, some of the principles behind it seem to underlie a lotta the advice I get. 

My first question: how do you decide what your sleep time window is? I have a set wakeup time that I adhere to (still live with my family so I’m not a perfect adherent lol), so I assume my bedtime is whatever I choose to be the “correct amount of sleep”. That’s my hangup. I’d say I operate well on an average of 6-6.5 hours, but there’s some nights I succeed in 7.5, some where usual sleep hours doesn’t cut it the next day, and some where my anxiety is so bad, I don’t know if it’s best to just not be in bed until I (potentially) feel tired.

My other question: what should I do if I don’t have an actual bed? I sleep on the couch in my bedroom, which is where I spend half or most of my time when I’m not at work (don’t worry, I wash it regularly haha). The whole “don’t associate your bed with non-sleep activities” is something I would be disregarding but default. I’d argue my best sleep usually comes from dozing off to low volume tv.

,insomnia,"I've been referred by my PCP to 2 sleep specialists, and both of them have suggested I do CBT-I before considering new medication (my medications are no longer working) because my sleep study was inconclusive. The waiting list is long. I have tried the CBT-I methods on my own, on multiple occasions. The methods have not helped. I have struggled with sleep from a very young age. It started with night terrors, then occasional insomia (treated with melatonin), then prescription medication, then prescription medication WITH melatonin, because my medications would stop working after 3 months to a year.

Specialists and PCP tell me it will be 6 weeks of CBT-I. I am now thinking that ultimately, the risks outweigh the benefits. Not only have I been unsuccessful on my own, what difference will it make with a telehealth appointment? I work a very tough job, I need to be well rested, healthy, and strong. Mentally and physically. They told me, ""you may not get ANY sleep doing these methods, for at LEAST 3 weeks"". I already get very poor quality sleep, maybe 4 hours or less of okay-ish rest a night. I would virtually be killing myself during this timeframe. I would faint at work, be unable to attend my in-person doctors appointments, go into a depressive episode, chronic illness/pain will flare up, or maybe even my psychosis or paranoia will come back as strong as it was before I took medication.

I spoke to my Psychiatrist, and he seems to be open to giving me medications without requiring me to do a full 6 weeks of CBT-I. It is just taking a long time to get them. I see him once every month, and he only allows for one change to a medication every session. ADHD medication was our first priority, but I cannot tell if it's helping because I haven't been sleeping for more than 3 months. I had a session with him earlier this month, and I told him I have not been sleeping. He told me ""we'll keep everything the same and reconnect in a month"". Seriously? I don't understand his reasoning. I hate that I have to fight uphill battles just to get some sleep.

It started with night terrors, then occasional insomia (treated with melatonin), then prescription medication, then prescription medication WITH melatonin, because my medications would stop working after 3 months to a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specialists and PCP tell me it will be 6 weeks of CBT-I. I am now thinking that ultimately, the risks outweigh the benefits. Not only have I been unsuccessful on my own, what difference will it make with a telehealth appointment? I work a very tough job, I need to be well rested, healthy, and strong. Mentally and physically. They told me, &amp;quot;you may not get ANY sleep doing these methods, for at LEAST 3 weeks&amp;quot;. I already get very poor quality sleep, maybe 4 hours or less of okay-ish rest a night. I would virtually be killing myself during this timeframe. I would faint at work, be unable to attend my in-person doctors appointments, go into a depressive episode, chronic illness/pain will flare up, or maybe even my psychosis or paranoia will come back as strong as it was before I took medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke to my Psychiatrist, and he seems to be open to giving me medications without requiring me to do a full 6 weeks of CBT-I. It is just taking a long time to get them. I see him once every month, and he only allows for one change to a medication every session. ADHD medication was our first priority, but I cannot tell if it&amp;#39;s helping because I haven&amp;#39;t been sleeping for more than 3 months. I had a session with him earlier this month, and I told him I have not been sleeping. He told me &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;ll keep everything the same and reconnect in a month&amp;quot;. Seriously? I don&amp;#39;t understand his reasoning. I hate that I have to fight uphill battles just to get some sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have multiple mental health diagnoses and chronic illnesses. All I want is some sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

This medication has actually saved my life.) Ive read insomnia meds like Ambie* can cause sleepwalking as a side effect, but for trazodo** its not listed as a side effect and it isn't a controlled substance. (Sorry idk if naming medications would get me banned). 

So one morning, I woke up for high school and remembered having a dream where I was having car troubles. When I went downstairs, I found my dad reading the news, and my car's user-manual sitting across the table from him. Shocked after having a DREAM abt car troubles, I asked ""hey whys the manual out? Is something wrong with my car???"" He responded ""no idea, it was there when I woke up."" I legit thought he was pranking me, so I pressed him about it, but after a bit I knew he was being honest, especially because he’s a very serious person and not one to play pranks. In fact, I’ve never seen either of my parents play a prank. When my mom woke up, I asked her ""u got my user-manual out last night right??"" She was so confused and swore she didn’t. My dad handles everything car related so I believe her. At this point my dad was veryyyy annoyed, and went off on me about making such a big deal of this nonsense. He said “It was OBVIOUSLY you, you prolly don't remember bc of that damn shweed."" My parents hated that I smoked but I was barely even high that night. And since it was just me and my parents in the house, I obviously believe them at this point, and thought maybe I really did do it, maybe I sleepwalked, especially considering my dream. I didn't wanna believe it tho so I pressed them just a lil bit more until my dad is so frustrated that he’s full on screaming at me and then stormed out for work.

So ya, I had to accept the fact that I SLEEPWALKED INTO MY CAR. And I park in the driveway, so I would've had to go outside and open a rather complicated lock on our gate. And I ALWAYS locked my car, I NEVER forgot, ESPECIALLY in the driveway overnight. So I would've had to grab my keys, unlock the car with an unmarked button, dig thru my messy glovebox to find it, go back inside, and put my keys back where I left them. I started switching up where I kept my keys after this.

A desperate last resort, I went outside to see if my doors were unlocked. They were. Like I said, I never forgot to lock my car and was sure I’d locked it that night. Maybe my brain was just playing tricks on me? But how could it just be in my head, when the proof was sitting on the kitchen table, and I remembered having a dream abt car troubles BEFORE I EVEN SAW the manual????

To this day my brain is still boggled at how I was capable of this, and how in my entire life it only happened ONCE. (That i know of). I would think for someone to sleepwalk into their car or something of that extent, they would have to be a professional at it, like a chronic sleepwalker.

This is probably in the top 5 craziest things thats ever happened to me. This was like 5 years ago and I’d kinda forgotten about it until something reminded me of it the other day.

,insomnia,"Hi Reddit!

I've got a particularly weird problem that i haven't heard of before and I'm wondering if anyone else has ever had the same experience. 

Background: I deal with what I would say is ""normal"" insomnia, where it is very challenging to sleep regularly and take some OTC medications like doxylamine succinate after quitting some prior prescriptions. I'm used to not being able to sleep due to my brain refusing to shut off or slow down, but this is different. I do have diagnosed ADHD, depression, bpd, insomnia, and anxiety. 

This new issue started in the last month or two and has happened 4 times I think. I fall asleep okay enough ,sleep for a few hours, then wake up to use the bathroom or get water. The issue begins when I try to go back to sleep. The best way I can explain it is that it feels like my brain is trying to create several dreams simulatenously and I can see them all happening. A lot of them feel realistic and can be simple things like hearing knocking or checking the time and it's an hour ahead of real life. The vast majority are very odd and don't make any sense, basically like dreams. Similarly to dreams I don't remember much of them but I do remember bits and pieces and it has even caused me to remember things like they were in these ""dreams"" instead of how they actually were. None of these are really nightmares fortunately,  just very very weird. I would consider them much weirder and distorted than dreams normally are.

While this is happening I'm awake and not able to get past this weird dream production stage. I'm awake to the point that I'm conscious of the issue and if I stop closing my eyes everything is normal again. Ive tried taking medicine like doxylamine when this happens but I just get extremely sleepy without fixing this issue. I believe each time except once this has happened I spent 3+ hours trying with no luck like today. One time I was able to sleep after an hour or two. 

I've never done any harder drugs or hallucinogenic stuff past weed, but this is what I imagine some of them might feel like. I haven't had any in a long time to clarify, but I do drink. 

Has anyone ever experienced something like this or heard of it? I'd really like to find a solution or any resources on the issue if it's a more known thing. I honestly feel like I'm losing my mind until I open my eyes.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.

,insomnia,"As I am sure most people here are well aware, many of the medications prescribed for sleep can have negative long term effects on the brain and cognition. Yet, not sleeping well also has long term negative effects in this area. This is my primary concern as I pursue a career in academia; I do not really mind some other purely physical long term side effects on my health, but I cannot have my cognition impaired. 

I used to self-medicate for my insomnia by either drinking, smoking weed, or taking OTC diphenhydramine. When I finally talked to my doctor about it, he put me on zopiclone to take occasionally because he was aware of how it can be habit forming, so I am on a prescription where I am limited to taking one once every 2-3 days. While zopiclone has been largely effective and thus far (the last 6 months) my tolerance has not increased, I still end up taking OTC meds to get to sleep on the off days. Or, on nights where I am going out drinking anyway, that usually provides enough sedative effect to put me out. Moreover, zopiclone, benadryl, and obviously alcohol have bad long term effects on the brain or cognition. So I am not happy in my current situation and do not think it is tenable long term, yet I simply do not sleep unless I take something.

I recently tried a clonidine pill that I got from a family member.

At first my background story : 
3 months ago , one night, my body refuses to sleep, and every attempt for it had been canceled in a phase of falling asleep(in a moment of drifting to sleep , brain agresivelly wake me up). 

I am visited psychiatrist after four days of very poor sleep. After some questions about me and my life , I was diagnosed with deprresive-anxiety disorder. 

He gave me Trazodone , which working about three months . Two days ago after consultation she prescribe me Amytriptiline , which works first night , but second not very much. I am taking also Lexapro. 

And my question is , did somebody was in situation like me, when brain wakes me up when I try to sleep? After some time I fall asleep , but brain wakes me up early in the morning and battle starts again. 

I know it is not hardcore insomnia in my case , but I am really tired of this ""brain waking me up"" thing . 

I want my sleep back as it was before 😔

,insomnia,"Hey everyone, i have suffered from insomnia since 15 years old. i'm 35 now and i have made some serious breakthrough over the last 8 years, but saddly i'm not 100 % insomnia free because i still have setbacks like now especially when my life becomes more challenging / stressful.

I read a bit through the posts, and it's clear that a lot of people are going down the same path i used to, where your insomnia is totally out of control and slowly ruins your life ... No matter what you do, you can't reduce it, and the more you try, the worse it gets.

Ok so long story short when i was 26 or 27 my insomnia caused me to lose my job and i was really, really mind broken and physically diminished to a great extent, so i started telling myself : either i fix this either i can't keep on like this and i'm going to end myself...

So i started sitting down one hour a day and slowly thinking through about the problem, and what were my possible way of acting on it. Basically at this time i started noticing i had chest pain, and those chest pains were always corresponding to a bad night. From there my awareness increased of myself, and i started doing a lot of meditation and deep breathing exercices for hours.

I became conscious of my mental / energetical / physical state in a more deep way and because of this i was able to witness the connection between my state and my sleep.   
  
As opposed to simply obsessing over sleep, and getting frustrated and obsessed because ultimately what you're doing when you're like this is just increasing stress, anxiety, exhaustion...

This was a turning point because my insomnia did not totally seem out of control anymore, and i was able to stop the negative spirals where i wouldn't sleep for days and almost go crazy, crying, etc...

From there i discovered chinese medicine and started studying it. Chinese medicine has a lot to say about insomnia and i'm not gonna go into details here but the idea is that each person is singular, and there several kind of imbalances that can create insomnia.

If you're chronic insomniac, there is a very high chance your body has one of those imbalances.

For example, a very hardcore form of insomnia is having your kidneys extremely tired, and you absolutely can't sleep and feel exhausted. Then you have insomnia where people wake up at 3 am every day.

But the most frequent insomnia i had is a form of insomnia that is linked to exhaustion itself. Being drained / exhausted, you might be calm but it's absolutely impossible to sleep.

So the main idea is that you need to build awareness of yourself and instead of focusing on the symptoms (insomnia) start working on feeling better through the day, but in a concrete way. For me, it's a lot of rest (lying down) and breathing slowly for an hour. But if you're very imbalanced, it might not work straight away. you will feel better, but not enough that your insomnia is trully cured. That's why it's important to become aware of this holistic aspect, so you don't go crazy thinking ""Why the hell can't i sleep?"".

Since i used this approach, i have made progress and i sometimes have periods for months where it seems like insomnia is a thing of the past. But saddly i tend to get exhausted easily and fall back into imbalance.

For me, I have insomnia but it's not that bad. Max four hours before I fall asleep, but I'm worried for another person.

This person has really bad insomnia, hell she laid in bed and couldn't sleep until 9am in the morning, and that's really affecting her. It's been like that for as long as I can remember, but only recently for three weeks did it get really bad.

So listing off what she did do to try, for one, listening to music, relaxing, meditating, all of those things she's tried. She also can't take sleeping pills either because she has a heart condition and Im not sure how but it messes with it so she can't take it.

,insomnia,"Hey guys so I am experiencing a very strange type of insomnia. 

I'm not sure exactly what's going on but there is most certainly a pattern happening here. 

So for some background context, I have a diagnosis of adhd and as such I am prescribed stimulants, I have been taking stimulants for over 7 years now with no real adverse side effects, my sleep for the first few years was pretty consistent, I'd sleep at 11 and wake up at 7. 

My current dosage is 40mg of vyvanse. 

I take fish oil, and Magnesium citrate before bed, I exercise regularly, I eat quite well ( some days I fast ) making sure I have sufficient nutrients, and I try and keep my self mentally stimulated throughout the day. 

However ive noticed lately that if I have a really good quality sleep, my medication is far more effective and I feel fantastic, however on the days after I get a really good sleep and I feel fantastic, I find it impossible to sleep regardless of what I do during the day. 

On days I don't get a good sleep I pass the fuck out and get a great sleep and then the cycle repeats. 

I consistently take my medication daily and sleep just fine even if I take it as late as 11am, it's just days where I've felt actually well rested that I cannot sleep, this even happens on days I take a break from the amphetamine and even on days when I wake up early and refreshed and take my meds as early as 6am. 

Some signs point to a type of psuedoinsomnia as I do feel like my nervous system is still awake even if I sleep sometimes ( I think it's called hyper arousal or something ) 

I did experience trauma a few years ago and my fight or flight system was ""on"" for way too long which could explain the hyper arousal, all though this has dramatically improved over the past few months. 

I don't experience any kind of come down from the medication either I feel more of what I'd describe as an after glow.

,insomnia,"My regimen for good sleep

I just wanted to share my vitamin regime in case it helps anyone else.

I take vitamin B1, 1000MG daily, and 1000MG of Vitamin C, and 700- IU of vitamin E daily. These help with thoughts and physical health. Vitamin E is also good for the heart.

Take a glass of “cal mag” daily. Recipe here:

https://retail.vitalbulk.com/cal-mag-drink-kit/

For sleep routine-  I take two B5 before bed with one 500MG niacin (flush kind). Warning: you may want to start in with 100mg as you will flush. I find the flush relaxing. Don’t start with 500MG but perhaps start with 100MG if you start this routine.

I take the B5 and niacin about 30 mins before bed, and then I will take 500 MG of L-Tryptophan, and a magnisem glyconate pill, 120mg.

If I feel like I need to, as a secret weapon, I will take “Adrenal Support” by Dr. Berg to really seal the deal.

As another tool, I say to myself “I am asleep” over and over if I need to, and it helps in conjunction with the above. You can work to have command of yourself.

I have black out curtains, sleep with AirPods white noise playing, and have two pairs so I can change them out when I get up to pee.

,insomnia,"TL;DR last two paragraphs.

Just wondering. I had acute insomnia. After that (prescribed by my doc), I managed to sleep again for 22 days straight with no sleep meds. I was happy. I had increasingly good sleep.

Then I had a major argument with my partner right before sleep time, a panic attack. Back in the sauce now. I have a mean anxiety disorder which keeps turning. I'm all about that sleep hygiene but I'm also too sick to take long walks unfortunately. I'm pretty much 24/7 in my room.

I also happen to have ME/CFS, a chronical brutal illness, and am currently in a mild crash. Meaning if I don't sleep, I get a strong headache for the whole day. The stakes are higher this time, which means less acceptance emotionally for not sleeping. Two family members currently have covid/a mean flu and I don't want a shit immune system doring this time.

So. After these 22 days I took doxylamine again, four times now, with two days of no meds in between (okay to shit sleep). But they ran out (and tolerance spiked anyway).

So: I am very scared of benzos. But it's been 32 days since I took oxazepam. Am I at increased risk if I were to try the same spiel again? I only have 6 pills left, my doctor says she won't ever prescribe me any again anyway.

(My doc wants me to just take mirtazapine for a whole month or more. But she doesn't understand I think that I believe it's not yet chronic. I had 22 days of good sleep after all.)

I may try without pills again this night depending on how tired/scared I feel. Just not sure if there is an increased risk of dependance of oxazepam It was just 3 days middle of September, and it's just gonna be 3 or 4 more this time, then the pills run out anyway. But what if my body sorta remembers the drug even after the 30 days and now these 4 days are enough to get me hooked? Would appreciate some insight.

It started with what I’m pretty sure is sleep anxiety, but  now it’s like I’ve completely forgotten how to fall asleep. I’m tired during the day but as soon as it’s time to sleep all tiredness goes away. I can be watching tv dosing off and as soon as I turn the tv off I can no longer get tired. I become hyper aware of my bodily functions like my heartbeat and breathing, and get a panic attack every time I feel my self starting to drift off into sleep. I lay in bed and no matter how mentally and physically exhausted I am I can’t sleep. 

I’ve tried no screens. I have tried the sleep hygiene techniques. I’ve used melatonin, unisom, magnesium, and trazadone and I stay away through every one, even if I combine them all. The next day I feel like a cognitive wreck when they don’t work and it’s even worse than just not sleeping. 

I don’t even feel like myself anymore. All aspects of my life are suffering. From the moment I wake up I dread being able to sleep that night. I’m severely depressed and anxious constantly.

&lt;p&gt;i mean, i COULD try and get therapy but i really don&amp;#39;t want it (it&amp;#39;s a whole other story that I don&amp;#39;t think you guys will be interested in, if this post even reaches someone) but really my whole teenage years, even being good, I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ve actually enjoyed its good moments, and this makes me even more depressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i guess depression, anxiety and insomnia are really doing a number on me, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by the way, i literally just woke up.&lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,"My whole life I have had sleeping issues. It’s always been bad. In highschool my parents got me on sleeping meds 50mg of trazodone and 50 mg of seroquel. Worked great but as a teen of course I wanted to stay up till ungodly hours of the night so I wouldn’t consistently take them. 

In 2020 at the age of 22 I started taking 50 mg of trazodone every night again, increased to 100mg then 150mg. I did get a little “hooked” on them because without them it is just impossible to sleep. I was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism and a pituitary tumor and my pcp recommended that I try to get off trazodone to improve my energy levels, headaches, low blood pressure and other symptoms. I tried but made it about a week or two, tapering off of 150mg of the trazodone. I am in college so after a long day of studying it is nice to have extra help falling asleep, but sometimes 150mg doesn’t do anything and I am still awake all night but do not want to go any higher than 150mg or switch to anything else. 

Last night I realized I was out of my script (I got new insurance and forgot to let my psych know…) So, I picked up melatonin and was up all night long. I am used to this as sometimes even with the medication I still cant sleep. I put on my eye mask and meditated until my alarm went off at 6am. Did not sleep a wink… Today even though I was tired I felt better. I am planning on telling my doctor I want to stop the sleeping pills of course. But my prescription comes in the mail in a few days and I want to have some on hand incase it gets bad some nights. 

Does anyone have any suggestions/tips for trying to get to sleep naturally? I really want to get my thyroid levels to normal and hopefully shrink the pituitary tumor. I am working with my doctors to help with that but really think the trazodone is impacting my healing. 

I started having awful dizzy spells at night after taking the trazodone even if i cut the 150mg in half, and lots of other issues I suspected were thyroid/pituitary issues. (Doctors are aware of this but understand my insomnia is severe and let me choose to stay on the meds and it is hard to tell what is the tumor/thyroid and what symptoms are from the medication)

The list of symptoms goes on… but I am really tired of relying on pills and feeling groggy during the day. I really do not want to rely on the pills for the rest of my life and want to see if being off the trazodone helps with any of the symptoms. I appreciate any advice or input on if anyone has ever stopped any treatment/medication.

,insomnia,"I read a couple dozen of these posts and I feel like I’m in the right place. I just have to talk about this. 

I have had poor sleep for the last year. My brother died by suicide, I traveled home over night and didn’t sleep for over 42 hours until I crashed out. Since then sleep has just been crap. 

Recently I lost my job - Sep 3 - but I’ve gotten a new one that I don’t start until November. I can feel the visceral stress. I can feel the pressure. It’s made my sleep so much worse. For some reason, I wake up at 3am on the dot after falling asleep at 11pm. Some nights I will sleep through the night with no issues. But the nights that I wake up - my brain is running at a constant rate of Mach Jesus. I’m a biologist so I oftentimes wake up thinking about my work and I can’t even think of resting until I jump up, take some notes and read. When I try to go back to sleep - things get weird. 

I will experience insane hypnagogic jerks. Sometimes I “hear” loud bangs and they will wake me immediately - heart pounding, start sweating. I’ll be so scared. Or sometimes I’ll be having nice thoughts before sleep and suddenly they will become just plain awful, gruesome, or terrifying. It causes me to wake up scared and sometimes even disoriented. I’ll have to remind myself of where I am and what time it is. Sometimes I don’t even feel like myself and my arms and legs feel weird and kinda like they aren’t mine. It’s terrifying. If I wake up at 3 I usually don’t go back to bed until 6/7 and I’ll wake up 2 hours later.

But when I wake up - I’m perfectly normal. I feel incredibly well rested. I can read, take notes, and I’m super energetic. I’m not noticing any cognitive deficits at all. Which just drives me crazy because wtf you know? 

I lost my health insurance so I can’t see a doctor but I want to go see one so badly. This has me so scared and worried. It has me feeling like I’m going crazy and sometimes I’m afraid to even go back to sleep. I’ve been trying to banish the bad thoughts and it’s helping. I’ll fall asleep think of wonderful thoughts and things and if it stops I’ll wake myself up and start again. But still I can shake that feeling of going crazy I get in the middle of the night.

,insomnia,"
I’ve been trying to explain to my doctor that my issue isn’t a lack of sleepiness or routine, but a heavy feeling in my chest when I try to sleep that increases with intensity as the night goes on. Then, whenever I start to fall asleep, I experience what feels like a sudden drop on a roller coaster that wakes me up suddenly. It’s like a jump scare and can sometimes be very intense and confusing. 

I’ve tried CBT-I, which just made me more anxious and intensified this problem. I’ve been doing the sleep hygiene stuff for 9 months (no laptops or eating in bed; get up at the same time everyday; no naps; etc.). I don’t drink caffeine or alcohol and I don’t smoke or take any other drugs. And it’s not that I’m not feeling sleepy. Sometimes I can’t keep my eyes open but I have the heavy feeling in my chest and I’m jerked awake every time I drift off.

I just need help getting past that falling asleep stage, and then I’m fine. 

Antihistamines do absolutely nothing except make me feel more tired for longer. It doesn’t actually help me sleep. Melatonin also did nothing to help me actually fall asleep. Ambien (5mg) worked incredibly well but the doctor is afraid to prescribe it.

The doctor also won’t refer me to a sleep clinic because the NHS is stretched and only cover specific issues, like apnea and sleep walking. 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with parasomnia overlap, but that doesn’t seem to be relevant to them in making the decision to refer me.

,insomnia,"Just as the title says - I have been struggling with chronic insomnia for almost 20 years and I am at my wits end.

Background:
I remember my sleep issues began in middle school. For many years I self medicated with alcohol to help me sleep. I have been sober since 2021 and my sleep problems have been out of whack. I worked night shift for 3-4 years, but have been working normal hours since late 2020. I have trouble falling asleep (tired around 1-4 am), and most recently I have trouble staying asleep. I have been diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder (well controlled), MDD (not currently an issue), and ADHD (treated with adderall IR). Some nights I feel I am in a half-sleep state and wake up every 30 minutes or so. I believe I possibly have DSPD or non-24. I signed up for an at home sleep study next month and will begin CBT-I. 

What I have tried:
* Sleep hygiene: limiting phone and TV before bed, sleep meditation, no caffeine after 2 pm, taking my last adderall dose before 2 pm, working out (before 6 PM)
* Trazodone: doesn't keep me asleep and plugs up my nose to the point I feel I have trouble breathing
* Benadryl: worked for a short period of time, now does nothing
* Melatonin (low dose 3 mg) + l-theanine + magnesium glycinate (200 mg): worked for a short period of time, now does nothing
* Gabapentin - doesn't help and just gives me major brain fog
* Hydroxyzine: doesn't help and makes me feel drowsy the next day
* Abilify: had a paradoxical effect and made me wired/more anxious
* Ambien: took for a few months before getting sober, I didn't abuse it but I am scared to take it again since there is a risk of dependence as well as I had sleep-walking and talking events I do not remember when I did take it 

Other meds I take:
* Adderall IR 10 mg twice daily (I take my second dose at around 1:30 PM)
* Propranolol 20 mg 1-2 times daily as needed for anxiety

Advice I want: 
* I am seeing my doctor tomorrow for a short-term medication solution until my sleep study and therapy begins next month. My current regimen of melatonin, l-theanine, magnesium glycinate, and sometimes benadryl at night is no longer effective.

,insomnia,"My body just can’t understand that sleep comes at nights and being awake is for the day. I can’t just “reset” if I wake up too late. I literally have to cycle through it or I just get stuck like I am now. It’s like I’m built for a 30 hour day; sleep 10, up 20. It’s infuriating because even when I have just one hour of sleep, I can’t fall asleep until the time I fell asleep the day before or later.

I’ve tried everything short of a doctor;
-Benadryl works but is illegal to be otc where I am studying (international uni student) and unisom is too strong. I just don’t wake up.
-reading before bed
-No phone before bed
-extra phone before bed (for same or soothing music)
-melatonin makes me really dizzy
-teas
-water
-no water
-bed only for sleep
-dark room
-calming tv shows 

Just nothing. And I don’t want to develop a dependency on sleep meds, so I’d prefer not to to take them but right now I’m desperate for a normal cycle. Like if I could reliably fall asleep between even 2am and 3am I’d be fine. It’s 4;00am rn and I’m stressing.

Wtf is wrong with me? All my friends are like “just lay there and it will happen” or “you must be looking at your phone more than you say/haven’t tried hard enough/need to stop your thoughts”. They just don’t get it.

Any ideas, tips, thoughts? I’m 26F of that helps. Only rx for sleep I ever took was hydroxyzine and it was not super effective for me-  I stayed awake thru it. It just made me feel sleepy but still couldn’t sleep. I should note that when I do sleep I have trouble waking up because body needs like at least 10 hours.

Has anyone used it primarily to get back to sleep after waking up several hours into the night?  I know with narcolepsy, it's prescribed to be taken at bed and also 4 hours later.

No medical conditions, healthy weight, eat healthy, get plenty of exercise, I don’t drink and don’t smoke (recently 30 days fully sober after a few years of maybe 3-4 drinks a month). I drink one cup of coffee in the morning and maybe a Diet Coke around noon. Melatonin doesn’t work for me. I’ve tried all the commonly mentioned tricks like magnesium, sleep hygiene, etc. Sometimes indulge in a CBN/THC gummy (this seems to help falling asleep but still wake up too early and can’t fall asleep).

I have always had trouble falling asleep, to the tune of taking 1-2 hours sometimes. Typically sleep great once I do fall asleep and never had trouble sleeping in or staying asleep.

However, the only way I could fall asleep amidst all of that was through weed, I didn't try a ton of things over the years because I'm terrified of having to get on harsh medication and never being able to sleep again due to it. So, I tried benadryl, which stopped working as it's an OTC, and I tried zopiclone, which was prescribed to me but only worked for a few days, and then I tried weed. Weed was the only thing keeping me afloat, but it was always a very rocky relationship where I've basically been flipping a coin every time I attempt to go to bed, in terms of the quality of the high I'd receive, whether or not I'd fall asleep, and the duration of the high and thus sleep. I've had to make changes with regards to my use of the drug over time as I've used it for over a year consecutively now each night in order to sleep, which I know isn't ideal but I tried naturally several times and each time couldn't sleep at all. So, initially I was using 2.5mg THC indica edibles, then upped it to 5mg, then 7mg, then 10mg. I then incorporated some CBD into the mix so that it's 4:1 or 5:1 (so 50 mg cbd and 10mg THC), and this was working for months on end until recently where I felt less and less certain about the overall amount of sleep I was getting, which then culminated, about 2 weeks ago, in me not sleeping for 3 days and taking an extra edible 2 hours after taking the 1st one, so 20mg spaced apart in total, I STILL couldn't sleep at all, and got 0 hours despite feeling vaguely high and tired--this was extremely traumatic to me and I eventually fell asleep for an okay amount of time after taking more than I normally take upfront a day later (20mg upfront and then another 10 2 hrs later). I was very relieved once this finally happened and vowed to try to maintain certain lifestyle changes moving forwards to avoid that sort of thing, but this only worked for about 1 week and now I'm literally right back where I was but worse. I tried all kinds of relaxation techniques yesterday despite being sleep deprived (going on 2 days of no sleep at all as of typing this) and then ended up having to take an extra 10mg 2 hours apart, then did so again another 2 hrs apart, and after having a total of 30mg in my system (ingested at spaced apart intervals) I still codulnt' sleep at all last night, literally not a wink, checking the clock every 10 minutes, no dreams, no sense of loss of consciousness, nothing. And this is with my only thing that used to work, and with me taking extra and eeverything, I'm at a total loss of what to do now as I'm so scared of having to be placed on some kind of extreme cocktail of pharmaceuticals and then never being able to sleep again, because I see all kinds of horror stories of people who get on SSRIs for example or olanzapine and then lose their ability to sleep entirely; right now I already feel dangerously close to that and that's just with a weed dependency... if I were to increase my dose upfront, would that even matter at this point? I know of tolerance breaks but the problem is I literally cannot sleep at all without weed, like I tried this in the past and was up for 4 days straight etc.

Does anyone have any insight into how this might be happening or what I could try, or if I'm doing somehting wrong... I take an edible right before bed with a single magnesium bis-glycinate tablet and then it usually takes between 1-2.5 hrs to kick in and put me to sleep, but lately it has just been making me feel vaguely high and more 'sick' than 'euphoric' but even with euphoric feelings they come extremely fleetingly and don't actually put me unconscious... I've heard of people on here going several months with virtually 0 sleep and no meds work for them, I'm so scared of this becoming me that even the notion of trying something other than weed implicitly terrifies me because if that med doesn't work then what am I supposed to do?

I always wake up at least once during the night even on nights when I sleep, but on nights when I sleep it's quite certain that I had fallen asleep. I was tested for sleep apnea with an overnight sleep study and my sleep results looked weird (no deep sleep, but I slept badly during the study) but didn't show significant apneas. The sleep specialist said my sleep study was within the range of generic insomnia. I had a low blood iron count so I take ferrous sulfate at dinner and my blood iron count is now within the normal range.

Not having one of those monotone, typically scary story youtube videos playings makes it feel even harder to do. The background noise helps occupoccupy the majority of the noise in my head. When i dont have a video playing i have all the noise in my head (usually random nonsense and a song playing VERY LOUD) plus i can hear the ringing in my ears. Makes it near impossible to get my mind even to a point of starting the story/daydream
    Then if i do make it to the story/daydream part, any slight noise, snore, or if my partner moves im instantly back to square one. And depending on how far into the story/daydream- sleep pipeline im in depends on if i get back to that point quickly or it takes hours again. But once im asleep im.pretty much OUT.

I slept in the same bed as my partner for years, and never even thought twice about it. I also have struggled with sleep forever. About a year ago I slept in a separate bed on vacation (hotel accidentally gave us two queens), and it was such a good experience I decided to bring it home. Now we sleep (very happily) in separate beds each night and it's honestly the best thing ever.

Why you should not sleep in the same bed:

* Everyone has a slightly different optimal sleep set up, and you should be free to explore yours
* You are likely being disturbed many times throughout the night even if you don't realize it
* If you have different schedules, your wind down and wake up is being disturbed
* Fighting over sheets, temperature, lights, noise, etc is a waste of time and energy

How to sleep in different beds:

* Set up a new room (if you have space)
* Swap your current bed for two smaller ones (you can still have a comforter that goes over both for aesthetic)
* Add a small twin bed somewhere else

Tips for the ""divorce"" conversation:

* Make sure they understand it's not about them, it's about you
* Be sure to reiterate it's something you want to do to be the best version of yourself
* Offer to lay with them before bed or in the mornings so it doesn't feel too isolating

Any idea why this happens?

I never had any issues falling asleep or sleeping through the night, but almost suddenly I found myself unable to do either.

I ended up using Ambien, trazadone, gabapentin, neurontin, melatonin and magnesium (sometimes all in one night). I really hated going to the Dr every 3 months to get drug tested before I got an Ambien refill. It felt like I was being treated as a drug addict (and I guess in some ways, I was).

I started to feel like my lack of sleep was bc my body was so used to unnatural sleep, so I was constantly trying to wean myself off of one at a time, but the insomnia and just not being able to function made me always go back to taking everything. I was so afraid of not getting enough sleep that I took meds religiously as a precaution. It was a nightly routine.

I began researching what to do, and tried to make an appt with a sleep psychologist, who needed a referral and said it would be months for me to get an appt even with one. I considered investing in sleep reset and sleepio, but didn't want to invest the money for something I was sure wouldn't work. 

Ok, so now on to the present: I found the app CBT-i Coach, made for Veterans (I'm not a veteran). It was research based and free, so I figured why not. With it, and with a strong desire to learn to sleep naturally, it's transformed my life!

Sleep restriction was, and still is, hell. I've been using the app for about 2 months now and I'm still not ""there"". But I learned a LOT about sleep restriction paired with hypnotic weaning, and I really gave it my best shot. 

Now, I'm not taking ANY prescription sleep meds. I'm not taking melatonin on most nights, and I'm down to just magnesium and chamomile. I'm not sleeping enough yet, but I'm getting more than 6 hours a night of natural sleep, and working my way up to more. 

I felt like my situation was hopeless. I thought I would just be one of those people that would never sleep naturally, and it feels SO good to do it! I'm so proud of myself and the changes I've made. I just wanted to post in case anyone found themselves in a similar situation.

 It goes by periods, usually associated with stress or just excitement.

I tried taking melatonine and similar but those have zero effect on me, I rarely took benzodiazepines but it had limited effect and it's not optimal to take it at 4am.

Conclusion:-basically we are trying to assess tolerance to caffeine and using its withdrawals symptoms to fix sleep cycle but the withdrawals also have unwanted effects with it and risks of cardiovascular problems 

Guide:-start from small  and take caffeine  before 12pm so that most caffeine could go out from the system on you bedtime and then start to increase the dosage to assess tolerance and after some time go cold turkey on caffeine and then withdrawals will come just use those withdrawals to fix the sleep cycle and after some time your withdrawals will stop but now your sleep cycle is fixed so does your insomnia 

Risks and harm reduction:- there's risks of cardiovascular problems including heart attack note these risks are from caffeine usage but to reduce these risks you can increase the caffeine dosage gradually with tolerance so that there will be lower strain on heart and one's your tolerance is pretty high you should leave the caffeine and use the withdrawals to fix sleep cycle and the withdrawals will disappear after some time aswell

,insomnia,"Was wondering if anyone has experienced this or if it is not related. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads :)

My sleep schedule has gradually gotten worse over the past couple years, to the point where I am usually just getting 5ish hours a night.
which I know is still pretty good compared to a lot of people who struggle with sleep.

The thing is I tend to stay up on purpose because I don't feel like going to bed, so I assumed not insomnia. However whenever i do go to bed earlier, even if I'm very low on sleep, I have a hard time sleeping. Mind racing and whatnot.

So I started wondering if maybe the reason is, I stay up so that I am too exhausted to possibly stay awake any longer, and then I don't have to lie in bed awake. So maybe the actual problem is some form of insomnia which could potentially worsen?

For background info, I have anxiety around lack of sleep due to anxiety about getting sick, and I had a lot of issues going to sleep in childhood that mostly resolved themselves in adolescence when I started going to sleep later. Had some insomnia briefly when I was abt 17, then it resolved itself again. Now I'm in whatever this situation is.

Idk, this may not be the case at all but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced staying awake super late to sort of make sure you're so exhausted you can actually fall asleep. Or if that's just sleep procrastination?

Over the past 3 years I have tried various diets to try to resolve my symptoms. I think I have found the solution that generally alleviates the symptoms that I suffered from. It seems to be the case that in order to alleviate the symptoms you need to boost gut microbial fermentation of dietary fiber in order to boost blood levels of short chain fatty acids. Because gut microbes are dynamic and their presence, abundance and lifespans are influenced by factors such as diet and health status, it is difficult to cultivate the kinds of bacteria that are highly efficient at fermenting dietary fiber. I think I have the solution that cultivates these microbes in the gut and therefore enhances blood levels of short chain fatty acids and alleviates various symptoms and improves general health. Anyone wishing to have a detailed explanation of what the solution is should message me. Otherwise I encourage you to try your own experiments with dietary fiber and try to figure out if you can see patterns of whether your symptoms improve or not. Bear in mind this is a very tricky process because there are many things that are regularly consumed by the general population that can inhibit the growth of gut good gut bacteria, there are many different sources of dietary fiber and the trial and error process can be expensive depending on what foods or supplements you are experimenting with.

,insomnia,"So in the last few days I went from sleeping 9-10 hours/night AND often having a nap during the day to never feeling like I’m sleeping at all. I know that I must be sleeping at least a little bit because I get severe nausea from pulling all nighters, and that hasn’t happened.

I went to sleep around 12:30 am last night and woke up at 6 am for work. Came home ready for a nap, but didn’t feel like I slept. I checked my phone after tossing and turning for a while and 2 hours had passed, but I felt awake the whole time. 

I have a couple theories. I once had hyperthyroidism; I randomly lost 40 pounds in the span of 5 months for no reason. I’m wondering if it’s possibly that or maybe hypothyroidism since I haven’t experience the same random weight loss again. I also have struggled with hormonal acne for years so my hormones are already out of wack.

On that note, I also recently started taking spearmint for said hormonal acne and it’s actually helped that problem a lot. It’s 1000 mg/day, but I’m wondering if that’s messing something up. 

My other theory is that I have too much serotonin. I take Lexapro and Welbutrin, and I increased my dose of Welbutrin a couple months ago (ironically because I was too tired).  I’m wondering if the effects just suddenly kicked into gear lol.

I know that I must be sleeping at least a little bit because I get severe nausea from pulling all nighters, and that hasn’t happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to sleep around 12:30 am last night and woke up at 6 am for work. Came home ready for a nap, but didn’t feel like I slept. I checked my phone after tossing and turning for a while and 2 hours had passed, but I felt awake the whole time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a couple theories. I once had hyperthyroidism; I randomly lost 40 pounds in the span of 5 months for no reason. I’m wondering if it’s possibly that or maybe hypothyroidism since I haven’t experience the same random weight loss again. I also have struggled with hormonal acne for years so my hormones are already out of wack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that note, I also recently started taking spearmint for said hormonal acne and it’s actually helped that problem a lot. It’s 1000 mg/day, but I’m wondering if that’s messing something up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other theory is that I have too much serotonin. I take Lexapro and Welbutrin, and I increased my dose of Welbutrin a couple months ago (ironically because I was too tired).  I’m wondering if the effects just suddenly kicked into gear lol. &lt;/p&gt;

As a history, I have always had sleep problems, needing specific environments (no light, cool temperature, nothing loud, etc.). But with these dealt with I slept fine. I'd have maybe one or two nights a month where Id try to fall asleep and be unable to the whole time, but other than that I was okay. Ever since early august though, Ive been sleeping horribly. I go to bed at 12.30 AM and wake up at 9.30 AM. Always have. But now I find it hard to not only fall asleep, but stay asleep aswell. Every single night, I either take forever to fall asleep, or wake up during my sleep, whether its waking up before its light out, waking up hours before im supposed to, or both. Sometimes I wake up once during the night and sometimes its multiple times. Sometimes there were specific causes, like the thermostat being set too high, causing me to wake up sweating in the night (though before the previous 2 months, id wake up sweaty in these cases at 9.30, not during my sleep), but the cases of a specific outside cause have been few and far between. Consistently I just have some problem every night.

I have diagnosed OCD and anxiety problems in general, but for the most part these are fairly under control. However whether I have a day with no worry or anxiety, or one where I worry a bit, I sleep like shit anyways, which never made sense if anxiety was causing it.

I never drink caffeine, and drink soda at lunchtime, which was never a probem before.

I also make sure to listen to something calming 30 minutes before bed and turn my device on black/white mode so there's no blue light, though I only look at it for a few seconds when turning what Im listening to on and off.

Melatonin doesn't help me sleep, which honestly does make sense because melatonin helps with your cirdadian rythm, but not actually making you fall asleep.

So once i realized that caffeine withdrawal could cause insomnia, i started drinking coffee again, but instead went to like 2 cups a day (which is what i should&amp;#39;ve just done in the first place)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its been about 4 months now and im still sleeping like shit and feeling like absolute garbage most days. I almost always wake up after 4-6 hours and sometimes am unable to fall back asleep. And ive noticed on days where i workout/do cardio i end up sleeping the worst one those days (which is strange because ive been lifting weights for 3+ years and never had issues like that!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive tried melatonin, magnesium glycinate/l-threonate and l-thenine and none of them seem to really do much. Is there anything i can do to get my sleep back upto 7-8 hours straight again?&lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,Hi everyone! I developed insomnia/somniphobia in December. It started with being scared to fall asleep after having an emergency c section. I thought I would die in my sleep for a while. Was put on benzo meds and that helped me sleep again. I’m off the benzos and somehow this fear of sleep is still there. I don’t fear dying anymore I just fear the exact moment I fall asleep or I should say my subconscious does. My logical mind knows this isn’t dangerous. Somehow my brain is convinced the exact moment of sleep is dangerous. I will get jolted for hours at night. I will manage to fall asleep and then be jolted awake. This happens for 2-3hours before I actually fall asleep and stay asleep. Unfortunately this makes my anxiety about sleep causing me to worry I won’t sleep. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and have a hard time going back to sleep because it took me so long to sleep in the first place. I’m trying my best to accept and not worry too much about it. That has seemed to help me eventually actually sleep because before this would happen all night then I would just cry until morning. Half my nights are actually normal now. I’ll sleep within 45 min but I still have the other half that are not great.

TLDR: For the first time in 8 years, I am making progress on my insomnia issues. I happen to be given a sleep mask with Bluetooth headphones, for my birthday. That has been the the key to helping me sleep more effectively. 


**Main Post Starts Here**


A while ago and made a post on here. About trying restricted sleep therapy. 


I did try restrictive Sleep Therapy for a little while, until I had an appointment with my doctor. It did help a bit, The longer I tried it the harder it became, and the harder it got. Partly because it is a very difficult type of therapy to do. It requires a lot of discipline on on your part to do it successfully. 

But I was doing it, I made some progress almost immediately. My daytime fatigue, however was not getting better. 


As the person with the ADHD, I do have a psychiatrist, I have kept him in the loop about this for many years. I mentioned this restrictive sleep therapy, and he thought it was a really good idea. However, with how tired I am, and how much sleep debt I likley have, due to how long-term my issue has been. It was going to be a very long an difficult road for me. 

While he did believe that restrictive sleep therapy was really good idea and something I should try. He also  prescribed me, 25-50mg per day dose of trazodone to use in the meantime. As it may be easier to be successful with sleep restriction therapy,  if I can catch up on some sleep before hand. Especially since, I wake up in the middle of the night and can't sleep. I am still  so profoundly exhausted, that even if I do get up I'm just going to move my pillow and blanket to the couch and watch TV. Which sort of defeats the purpose of sleep restriction therapy. 


I wrote myself a survey on many different topics regarding my heath and fill it out every night, with one section being specifically on my sleep. I decided to do a month trial with trazodone, and then try a month trial, with restrictive sleep therapy. To see if one is more effective than the other for me..

The first few nights I took trazodone I noticed it really didn't do much for me. It could just be the dose and it likely is. 

HOWEVER, I got a new sleep mask for my birthday. I have used a sleep mask for many years, to help me sleep, and to improve my sleep hygiene.  This sleep mask is next level! Goes around your head and attaches with velcro, and It can be as tight or loose as you want which help with comfort. There are eye pads inside the mask that really block out the light! It's as dark inside that mask, as dark as it is inside of a mine! That's the best thing I can think to compare it to.  Additionally, it has Bluetooth headphones that further helps  me block out the world.

Since I got that mask, I have been sleeping so much better. I'm intentionally not mentioning the brand or providing links. As I don't want this to be misconstrued, as a fake post meant to advertise these silly masks. I have absolutely no affiliation, with this company, and  was not even aware of themof them, before I got a mask on my birthday. 

I have always been the kind of person, who can never sleep in. It doesn't matter if I want to, I cannot sleep in. I have always woken up natu been awake between 6am- 7:30am, no matter if j want to or not, and will not fall asleep again, until the evening. Which makes it really hard to catch up on sleep through sleeping in. I have always had to go to bed early if I want to catch up on sleep.

 Since I got this mask I have been sleeping in so late! Before I got this mask I could probably count on my fingers, the amount of times I slept in to 9:00 am in my lifetime.  I have slept into 9:00 a.m. almost everyday since I got this! There have even been a couple days, I slept into noon! I have not done that in my entire life. Not even in my college years when I had a hangover! 


For me, I am now wondering if the key to me sleeping well, is sensory deprivation as opposed to any amount of therapy or medication. (Though I am sure a strong enough dose of medication would put me out like a light!) It dose seem likely sensory deprivation, it either the key, or a key component, to fixing my sleep issues. 

The point of this post, is to potentially  help people, who are also dealing with sleep issues, that have not yet found a solution to yet
 If this is you, try sensory deprivation. Find a way that works for you. For me it means It's means a sleep mask a sounds of tv, movies, thunderstorms sounds or other audio content. But for you it might be different.

The trick for me, when it comes to what Audio I listen to at night, does seem to be that if it's something interesting, like a TV show or a movie. It needs to be something, that I know  inside and out. Something so familiar to me I won't be interested, in following the plot. Simply happy to listen to it, without being tempted, to take my mask off and watch the screen,  as slowly and peacefully drift off to sleep. 


Am I still fatigued?? Yes I am. The difference is I'm now making progress now, For the first time in 8 years. Even if this at Plateau's at some point. I have still found first method, that is helped me make progress with my sleep. Either way, that's a win!

I suspect my fatigue will ease once I have caught up on sleep..


The only con I have found so far

Prior to this, I would toss and turn all night. If I managed to fall asleep I would wake up often because I was so uncomfortable and would need to move, which is not great.  Now, I have the opposite issue, I am so fast a sleep, I will sleep for hours in one position and I will wake up (way less often) with pain from sleeping in that position, or with my limbs numb with pins and needles and cold from lack of circulation. I am going to mention this to my Dr, as there are risks to this.. but for now I am finally getting sleep. The sleep I so desperately need.

,insomnia,"We got it all backwards!

Like all of you i spent way too much time perfecting my sleep routine and chasing that perfect sleep environment. But nothing worked

Here is what did:

1. Fight your demons

Something is keeping you up at night. Stress, anxiety, important change in life. You gotta process it or else it will never go away. Meditate, journal, get therapy, talk to ppl but resolve your pent up shit. I was drowning myself with music and podcasts non stop but.... in bed there is nowhere to hide from your thoughts. 


2. Stimulus

Phones, gaming, alcohol, sugar, intense cognitive activities, porn, doom scrolling, huge meals near bedtime will fuck you up (most of these things will ruin your life in general but especially before bed). Chill out, keep lights dim, do some chores around the house (mop, cook, repot stuff, read). I started taking loooong walks before bed and it helped a lot. NO PHONE ON THE WALK. Just roam and observe the world.

Ps. Dont be too cold. Lost a night of sleep from gymming late than roaming in a t-shirt when it was 8 degrees outside. Might have as well taken an icebath before bed


3. Know your supplements

I take a mix of magnesium, valerian, lthiamine before bed. Melatonin fucks you up long term and benadryl gives me tachycardia. So i had no medical cruch at my disposal. If you take melatonin, read how to take it right (ex. NOT before bed).


4. Bedtime and fatigue

Dont even try to sleep until you can no longer stay awake. Keep doing non stimulating shit until you are just about to curl up on the sidewalk. If you get into bed and cant sleep, there are 2 options:


4.1 just go through meditations (like NSDR). It will lower your HR and maximize your recovery, might even knock you out.


4.2 if you are super alert, get up and skip the night. Go gym, eat a fat chunk of steak, chug a coffee and get a headstart on your day. Next night you will build up so much sleep drive that you will fall asleep at least for some time (provided you followed the rest)


MOST IMPORTANT (cause i forgot to add it and don't want to change the numbers now)

Remember this, you dont need sleep. Yeah you'll be groggy and slow the next day but thats ok. Every sleepless night i got up and drove to work in downtown rush hour and was fine (aka felt like an emotional dumpster fire bud my body functioned fine). Our bodies are very resilient and very self calibrated. Your body will knock you out when it gets tired enough. We do not need to sleep every night. Soldiers in combat zones sleep 2h a night max for months and are ok (its not sustainable for life but functional for pretty long bouts).

Realize it, skip a night of sleep just to prove a point. Then next night go bed not to sleep, but to ""rest"". Be in bed but don't have a goal to sleep. Meditate, daydream and know that you are still recovering. Sleep deprivation effects our mood much more than our body. So dont mind the grogginess and trust your body to take care of you when you get tired enough. Go to bed with one thought ""IF I DONT SLEEP MEANS I DONT NEED IT YET, I AM HERE TO REST UNTIL MY BODY DECIDES IT NEEDS SLEEP""

And some nights you won't sleep (early flight, stressful day, neighbors partying...) but its ok. Trust your body to keep your running and to put you out when you get tired enough

Not an expert but a longtime anxiety driven insomniac trying to help with what worked for me. 

EDIT:
I have received many questions about melatonin and i realized i should have been clearer. My issue with melatonin is the following:

-supplemented melatonin is highly overdosed. According to some sources our body makes 0.2mg of melatonin per night. So taking 5, 10 or even 20mg is highly unnatural.

-its not regulated. Studies show that actual melatonin content in the pill varies a lot from advertised. Ranging from −83% (so 17%) to +478%
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534823/

This means that when taking a 10mg pill (max advised dose) you can be consuming up to 48mg of melatonin

- melatonin is often taken incorrectly where we (myself included) take it before bed and then take some more at night if the first didnt work. That is very counterproductive as it messes up the circadian rhythm and causes daytime drowsiness
https://marshalucasphd.com/sleepless-five-things-to-know-about-using-melatonin-correctly/

- read before that longterm use of melatonin causes your body to get less efficient at making its own (which would make you dependent on the supplement), but it seems that there is some dispute about it",[],False,,0,False,How i beat insomnia (i think 🤞),[],r/insomnia,False,,,0,,False,t3_1fzyveg,False,dark,0.87,,public,112,0,{},,False,,False,False,,{},,False,112,,False,,1728568583.0,,{},,True,,1728499590.0,text,,,,self.insomnia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We got it all backwards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all of you i spent way too much time perfecting my sleep routine and chasing that perfect sleep environment. But nothing worked&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fight your demons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something is keeping you up at night. Stress, anxiety, important change in life. You gotta process it or else it will never go away. Meditate, journal, get therapy, talk to ppl but resolve your pent up shit. I was drowning myself with music and podcasts non stop but.... in bed there is nowhere to hide from your thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stimulus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phones, gaming, alcohol, sugar, intense cognitive activities, porn, doom scrolling, huge meals near bedtime will fuck you up (most of these things will ruin your life in general but especially before bed). Chill out, keep lights dim, do some chores around the house (mop, cook, repot stuff, read). I started taking loooong walks before bed and it helped a lot. NO PHONE ON THE WALK. Just roam and observe the world.&lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,"Health Question

So 7 months ago I quit using a substance and it has led to a myriad issues with my health and primarily sleep. Since late February I have not gotten more than, at most, 7 hours a night, and usually closer to 6. 

A little over a week ago I started having some disturbing neurological symptoms. Dizziness and disconnection from reality, headaches and light sensitivity, general out-of-body experience. It persists throughout the day and usually is worst late morning and gets better by the end of the day. We are doing all sorts of tests and everything is coming back normal. Still waiting on a sleep study. Anyhow, my doctor is thinking it is severe sleep deprivation or apnea. But it’s been consistent 6-7 hours for MONTHS.

The last week has been terrifying and very debilitating. I can’t drive or work, and if I try and do physical activity for an extended period I become incredibly fatigued. My sleep has gotten better - deep dreaming and more of it. Could it really be related? Is my brain damaged??? I’m just really scared yall. The substance I quit can take a very long time to heal from and I just need some hope here. Idk what these symptoms are related to but my quality of life has been so severely compromised.

,insomnia,"I've been suffering from insomnia on and off ever since I was a teenager. Since the beginning of the summer it's been constant, most nights it takes me over 2 hours to fall asleep.

The doctor prescribed rivotril 0,5mg but it doesn't do anything. First time I took it it took me 1hr to fall asleep. Last time I took it it just didn't work, I took it before 11pm and fell asleep past 2am.

I am absolutely desperate and incoherent. I do things I don't even realize I'm doing like writing about cereal on an email thread about a software invoice, I walk around my house like a lunatic going in and out of rooms because I can't remember if I was gonna brush my teeth or put on my shoes or grabbing lunch. I go into rooms and grab random things and then I find myself in the kitchen at 8AM with a lemon in my hand and I have no idea why I am holding a lemon.

The doctor had prescribed zolpidem but I took it once as a teenager and it gave me hallucinations.

I have melatonin gummies but they don't work. I took melatonin pills and valdispert before and they don't work.

Before going to sleep I lie in bed reading and I turn off the light when I feel sleepy but 1hr later I'm still wide awake and I grab my phone (wrong, I know).

The only effect from the rivotril is that it makes me dizzy. I wanted to get up and go to the living room to do some coloring but I couldn't stand up.

After 2/3 nights of bad sleep I get into this loop where I'm anxious about falling asleep and then of course I don't sleep. I need one decent night of sleep to break the cycle. Then the nights when I have trouble falling asleep come, first days I get by ok, then I get to a point where the insomnia is really messing with my head.

Like I have more difficulty in sleeping at night but the sensation and the feeling of always being mentally tired is universal. How can I cope with this? Do you have any integrators that you would recommend? &lt;/p&gt;

I have been having horrible sleeping issues recently I have a completely nocturnal sleep schedule 

I decided I would pull an all nighter to fix this pattern as this usually helps me fix it 

I fell asleep around 7 AM then woke up at 8:30 

I tossed and turned till about 3pm and just decided to get up 

I felt super fatigued all day 

As soon as 8pm hit I decided to finally go to sleep but for some reason I cannot sleep I have been laying in my bed for 4 hours with my eyes shut 

This has never happened before my heart is racing and I am also having massive stomach pain/diarrhea  i also have chills

It also doesn’t help that I haven’t eaten all day and have no appetite 

I’m not sure what to do I’m having massive panic attacks every hour that I read the clock and see that an hour has went by I feel incredibly tired but I just can’t sleep I’m freaked out thinking I might have a heart attack from the lack of sleep I seriously don’t know what to do and I don’t want to go to the er

🏋️‍♀️I found it impossible to do high-impact workouts because it made my heart pound at night.

🔺 As a short-term solution, my doc prescribed me 1/4 of a dose of Seroquel (25mg). On some nights, I couldn’t sleep despite taking Seroquel (because I felt something was affecting my body, rather than my brain). 

🔺 After suffering through horrible PMS symptoms and a heavy period, I decided to take bio-identical progesterone the following month. I started taking it after ovulation, during the week leading to my period. 

🔺 I started to take beef liver pills, alongside B vitamins and Zinc 

🔺 praying every day helped me a lot - the changes took some time to kick in, so I tried to be patient

So I have struggled with insomnia since secondary school, and typically that’s a thing of I can’t fall asleep in the first place. 

But over the past week I have had a different issue where I am struggling to stay asleep. I wake up every couple of hours, for no real reason. It’s not as if I need to pee, or drink or whatever. I’ve occasionally had this in the past when I’ve not been very active but at the moment I’m doing 12 hour days at work and my job is very physical, so I tend to go to bed early because I wake up so early. 
I’m not anxious, or stressed, or anything emotional like that. When I do wake up I’ll run through breathing exercises and falling back asleep is easy enough.

I have a major deviated septum and swollen turbinates. This without a doubt is affecting my sleep and energy throughout the day but I think there's more to the picture.

Is it wise to do this before seeing a sleep doctor and getting a sleep study? I won't be able to compare the before and after results.

I think I also have a tendency to wake up to go to the bathroom. I try to not drink anything close to bedtime but sometimes I forget to drink something 3 hrs before and I just don't have another option. I also think I have a small bladder since I'm somewhat thin despite eating a lot. It also doesn't help I live alone so I don't have anyone to remind me to stop snacking or drinking before bed.

I also sometimes just get too energized before bedtime sometimes despite being also tired. For many years I was sleeping during the day and awake at night so I think it permanently prevented me from having a normal sleep schedule which I HAVE to get back to for work. I think ultimately I'll need to be on some kind of sleep medicine like Lunesta to get me to sleep and to stay asleep but then I'm worried about my bladder bursting if I drink too much water right before bed.

Sometimes I'll have just a small coffee during the day but I feel like even just that will last all the way to night and keep me awake sometimes but if I don't drink it then I won't have enough energy throughout the day on days where I didn't get good sleep.

What doctors will I have to see to fix this besides the ent I'm already seeing? A somnologist? A neurologist? A psychiatrist? Can I just see one? I'm already seeing too many doctors.

Can a somnologist prescribe sleep medicine like Lunesta without needing a psychiatrist?

I don't know if my ins will even cover a sleep study or a psychiatrist, we were surprised to even find out it'll cover the majority of the septoplasty.

I've been meaning to record myself sleeping but I forget every night. I might do it tonight and see how it looks.

Melatonin doesn’t work, other OTC sleep meds don’t work, I’ve tried ambien (made me hallucinate), hydroxyzine (high dose) kind of works but I’m hesitant to use so many antihistamines regularly due to increased risk of dementia/cognition long term. Idk what else to try. My doctor hasn’t been helpful. I also have two young children so I cannot take anything that makes me unresponsive at night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started Trazodone two days ago. I physically slept like a rock but my mind did not. I was having lucid vivid nightmares both nights. My mom and other female family members take Trazodone for the same reasons (PMDD) and they don’t experience any dreams at all. I normally dream every single night and have ever since I was a child. I lucid dream most nights but I could not for the life of me, wake from my Trazodone induced lucid nightmares. It was the absolute worst. Is this common? It also took a good two hours to even kick in. &lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,"Hi all -

I have really been struggling recently and I just need someone to talk to and maybe some advice if you've been in a similar situation. My sleeping issues started when I began having symptoms which were later diagnosed as gastroparesis back in 2017. I would be up all night in the bathroom with painful stomach cramps and nausea. This also gave me generalized anxiety. I was coping fairly well and managed to have success with melatonin/CBD, which I eventually switched only to melatonin.

Then I got pregnant, got off all my stomach meds and the melatonin, and honestly slept great. Once my daughter was born I had postpartum depression and my sleep went off the rails again thanks to the whole situation. I went on Zoloft and went to therapy and my sleep still wasn't 100%, but it was much, much better than it had been.

My most recent episodes started when I weaned from breastfeeding about 6 months ago. It made my GI issues kick up again, but they (and my sleep) got much better with Proton Pump Inhibitors and melatonin once again. I enjoyed about a month of minimal issues! Until August. I had finally managed to wean (properly-very slowly) off the zoloft, and I stopped birth control as we are trying to conceive again. We flew to visit my parents for 10-day stay and my sleep was messed. up. I figured it was due to my stomach, which was upset every night. But the insomnia has stayed with me and has even gotten worse - I've been having 4-hour sleep nights regularly, which is just not enough for me, as I'm very active and I have a 2-year old. It's a chicken-and-egg thing, a vicious cycle of upset stomach, anxiety, and insomnia. At this point I'm not sure what's starting what, but they're all making each other worse.

I don't know what to do. I'm at my wits end and starting to get scared. I am taking unisom, pepto bismol and anti-cramping medication basically every night, and on the worst nights I'm doubling the standard dose before I finally fall asleep around 3 am. It's not so much that I'm worried about anything in particular, I reach a state of dozing/extreme tiredness but can't cross the line into actual sleep. Songs play in my head and make me feel insane. I'm getting a bunch of GI tests done so maybe those will tell me something, but I can't keep going on like this.

,insomnia,"Quick story time: I had insomnia as a child, slept really bad had awful eyebags until I got into my teens and found out about the biohacks I'm about to share with you that made me sleep like a child ever since

First of all, to sleep like a child you must get rid of all(or most of) the stress and strain in your body. Being stressed gets you into something called the Sympathetic Nervous System - which is abother way of saying - Fight or Flight Mode

This is where our body can't sleep because it feels like its in danger. The reality is, it is really not and it just stresses itself in vain.

So to combat this, just take deep and slow breaths with 2 second intervals 5-10 minutes before sleep, then couple it with relaxing all your muscles, especially in the face

Couple this with a mantra(which can be just a sentence like: My house is safe, I can relax now, I am in safety) - you can say it or just repeat it in your mind.

As you take deep breaths, try to change the air in your room, open a window and let the cold and fresh air outside enter your room, this will cool down your room and enrich it with oxygen - components crucial for good sleep

As you go through these steps, try to detach from your stresses, as you can always pick them up tomorrow and you are not gonna do anything now in bed at night anyway.

Thats's pretty much the baseline for biohacking for sleep that anyone can do

To summarise these steps: 
- Take deep slow breaths with 2 second intervals
- Relax all the muscles in your body
- Change the air in your room 
- Relax your mind, repeat a mantra that will calm you even more

,insomnia,"This is a genuine question and, for context, I live in the UK. 

I’ve been suffering from anxiety-triggered insomnia for the past year and it’s getting out of hand. I tried CBT-I and it made it worse because the things they were asking me to do increased my anxiety about sleep rather than reducing it. They don’t actually listen to the cause of the insomnia. They stick you on a sleep deprivation routine under the assumption you haven’t tried sleep hygiene and aren’t already knackered. 

The GP eventually prescribed me zolpidem (ambien) which worked very well, but refuses to prescribe more because it’s habit forming, and a large part of me is like “so what if it is habit forming when it works?” 

What I’m struggling with is the distinction between “habit” and “treatment”. At what point does taking a drug become addiction versus just being effective? You can’t just give up anti-depressants without withdrawals and for all the SSRIs I’ve been on, I’ve always had to up the dose eventually, so how come that’s not considered an addiction or dependency? 

Would using an analogy comparing ambien with insulin or anti-depressants make sense, and if it did, would that even change a UK doctor’s mind? Or would that just flag me up on the system as a drug addict for even asking? I’ve seen the comparison between insulin and sleep medication on this sub before, though I thought anti-depressants might make more sense as a comparison.

As an aside, I was diagnosed with parasomnia overlap about 10 years ago, but the dr said that the symptoms (sleepiness during the day) weren’t bad enough to warrant giving me anything that would make me more alert because it would increase the anxiety. It didn’t occur to me that maybe sleep medication would be something to ask for (for better-quality sleep itself) because, at the time, I wasn’t struggling to fall asleep. In fact, I used to fall asleep immediately with no issues. It was only that I dream all the time and therefore don’t get as much rest. 

EDIT: I thought I should also clarify that none of the horror stories have come up for me taking ambien. I take one, put my head on the pillow, and sleep. It works very well with no side effects or unexplained night-time activities. 

EDIT 2: I’m understanding that the insulin thing is not a good analogy — I’ve just seen it a few times in Reddit and wanted clarity on it.

I'm looking for some advice about fixing a sleeping problem in my life. I had a serious relationship that ended horribly 2 years ago. I'm all over it now (in my waking life at least) but here's the context:

The girl I was going out with was my best friend. Knew her for 7 years and we moved in to live together. I loved her and wanted to spend my life with her but in the end it turned out she was cheating on me, lying, gaslighting, belittling, taking advantage and pretty much every trick in the book. I begged her to stay and work on this with me or leave so I can heal. She left our apartment and ghosted me. That whole situation is burned to the ground and the earth was salted a long time ago.

I felt so betrayed and this was the hardest period of my life but I fought for myself and now feel like my normal self, back on my feet, have my self worth and have had better partners. The one thing that is still lingering is - how I  wake up in the middle of the night almost every day. Some random situation in my dreams reminds me of my ex or her behaviour, my heart starts rushing anxiously, and I wake up without being able to fall asleep again.


Any experience with this, or any ideas how I can fix my sleep so my subconscious stays calm all night? Being in a normal healthy relationship immediately fixes this issue for me but it comes back when I'm single.

Thanks for your attention and advice &lt;3

,insomnia,"I always had problems sleeping, but over the last few years, thanks to being able to have a stable sleep schedule, I have been sleeping perfectly for the last 3 years (although at some periods I had trouble sleeping because of some events)
I always had depression.  I got 50mg quetiapine prescribed to me for depression a year ago

As I found what was causing my depression, I wanted to get off of the quetiapine by tapering. Everything was fine except for 2 weeks after being off of it
at the first 2 weeks it was fine, but then, I had high heart beat and high blood pressure, this somewhat(slightly) fixed itself, I then had insomnia 2 weeks after.

terrible insomnia, sometimes I slept good, sometimes bad. I tried everything. I was already taking doxylamine. Since I thought they were similar in action enough, maybe taking more doxylamine for a week or two and then going back to the usual dose would help me sleep, and it did. For a week I slept good, but then I had terrible brain fog, so I went back to my usual doxylamine dose, and I still had insomnia. I thought maybe I was going to bed too soon with respect to my usual sleep hour, but I was still tired, so I thought maybe I was going too *late* to bed, so I went to sleep sooner, but I woke up in the middle of the night.

I love how I feel off of this medication, I have real feelings, I am experiencing true happiness like I have never had before since I finally found what was causing my lifelong depression. 
But if I continue like this, I am going to fail everything, I have SAT tests coming up in 2 months and I can't waste my school year and chances of getting into college.

I give up, I'll take 25mg quetiapine for the time being, you win

(At this point, some people may think, ""Really?"", but in my case, it is true. I suspect that there are subtypes of ADHD, and that within those, there is a ""group for which antidepressants are effective."" Is there any useful concept for classifying ADHD types like that?)



However, if I use Cymbalta continuously for a month, chronic fatigue and brain fog always return. From then on, no matter how much I increase the dosage, I get the same results.



So, if I change Cymbalta to Pristiq or Trintellix, the chronic fatigue and ADHD symptoms disappear again, but all medications other than Cymbalta cause me ""severe middle-of-the-night awakenings,"" so I cannot continue using them.

① If the effect of Cymbalta disappears after about a month, what do you think is the cause or characteristic of me?



② Are there types of ADHD for which antidepressants (especially SNRIs and norepinephrine) are effective? Also, are there any concrete concepts for such classification, or people (places) who are thinking of countermeasures? \*I'm Japanese, but I heard that a person named Daniel G.

③I don't have any difficulty falling asleep, but I have trouble waking up in the middle of the night (I wake up after 2-3 hours of sleep), what do you think is the cause of this?

If there are any hypotheses or countermeasures for this, no matter how trivial they may be, please let me know. Because I am really struggling with this problem

,insomnia,"TLDR: my insurance denied my sleep study because I’m not obese. Can anyone recommend what to do?

Hey guys this is half a rant half seeking advice.  I don’t know if anyone here has done a sleep study before but I’ve been trying to get one for my chronic fatigue and insomnia.

I’ve struggled with insomnia ever since I was a little kid; probably only 2 or 3 years old. I remember pretending to be asleep whenever my parents would check on me so I wouldn’t get in trouble. 

My difficulty falling asleep/staying asleep didn’t bother me very much as a kid, but as I got older it’s evolved more and more into complete exhaustion. Most days I can’t form a coherent thought or focus on even a simple task. It feels like I’m trying to puppet my own body using strings I guess almost like there is lag between my brain sending a command and my body receiving it. 

I’ve been trying to seek help for the last 3 years now. A psychiatrist I saw a couple years ago in college recommended I get a sleep study done. I wasn’t able to at the time, but I kept a record of his recommendations and brought them to a doctor a few months ago. The doctor agreed it was a good idea and put the referral in for me. 

Fast forward a few months and both of my insurances have denied the referral for not being “medically necessary”. The referral office initially thought it was just written up wrong and made sure to include “excessive daytime drowsiness” as a reason I’m seeking a study. At the time they said this coupled with the fact I’ve experienced insomnia since childhood should be enough. It was denied again by both insurances. This time they sent me a physical packet saying that the reason I was denied is because I am not obese. That’s the only reason they provided me and I’m kinda confused about the whole thing. Mainly I’m upset that my private insurance denied me too. My appeals have also been denied.

If anyone has done a sleep study, would you be able to tell me what to do moving forward? Should I mention any specific symptoms? Is there another test I can request that might be approved?

I do not think she understood how horrible it was to deal with this. I honestly felt like I had lost my mind. All she did was say “it’s temporary.”

If you take trazodone and are told to stop taking it, I highly recommend asking if you can taper off of it. Even over a few days instead of just stopping.

I also want to add what a huge difference I have in my energy and my eye sight was way worse than I even thought, now that this medication is out of my system completely, I didn’t even realize how badly it got. I should have been taken off this medication a long time ago. It was making me blind and kept me in a constant state of exhaustion, I was always tired no matter how much sleep I got.

Original post: 

I’ve been on 150mg of trazodone a day for the past year and a half. During a visit for something else, I told my doctor that my eye sight has gone blurry and I’m seeing double vision in my left eye. She said my eyes are moving oddly, and took me off trazodone that day as she suspects this is the cause. She was right. It’s been a week now since I took my last pill and my sight has almost returned to normal.

The thing is, I’m now having panic attacks, auditory hallucinations, my sleep quality has diminished. I dream now every time I sleep, even when I take a quick nap before work, I never used to dream. 

Tonight was the worst, I was half asleep it felt like because I couldn’t get comfortable but I swear to god I heard my 5 year old son crying out for me. I shot out of bed, woke my husband up saying “there is something wrong!!” And ran into my son’s room, waking him and his sister up. I caused a huge mess at 1am.

I’m irritable, I got mad at stupid things that normally wouldn’t bother me. I feel like total crap and like I’m broke. Trazodone was helping me mentally in ways I wasn’t even aware and helped me be become normal. I feel manic now and like I’m going insane.

,insomnia,"Please go easy on me. I'm fully aware coffee is bad. I'm trying to quit. I'm addicted. 

My doctor seems to say my caffeine intake is not an issue.

I think it is. 
I drink a half pot of coffee a day. I start at midnight because my sleep schedule now fubar.

I start my night a of sleep around 9 pm. 
Wake up at 11 ish. 
I'll have a cup of coffee if I can't sleep again. Which is normal. 
 I'll sleep from 2am to 3am. Again then. Get up and repeat. Sleep again from 5 to 6 and repeat. 

6 am is usually my last cup. 
 And I'm done . So thats 14 hours of no caffeine.
 
I pass out again by 7 to 9 pm. As I can't even function. Because I've been doing this ritual for a year. 

I'm trying to not get up at 11 pm ish and have coffee. 
It works occasionally. And it's getting slight more and more often they I'm able to sleep more. But it's really difficult. 

I just can't seem to sleep more than 2 hours at a time no matter what. And it's been like this for a long time. 

2 sleep studies. No apnea. 
Again doctors are fully aware of my coffee habit and insist it's not an issue as long as I'm not having caffeine past a certain time. 🤷‍♀️ 

I'm struggling with this. 
I'm having a gut feeling it might be causing some insomnia. 

That being said. I have had issues on and of for years before this habit started. 

Getting off this caffeine has been one of the hardest things I've done in a long time. The migraines alone are terrible. 

Anyways. 

Anyone else have this kind of issue , where the possibility of caffeine even early in the day might be causing sleep issues? ",[],False,,0,False,Coffee and sleep related issues.,[],r/insomnia,False,,,0,,False,t3_1fyi7fg,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,False,,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,{},,True,,1728334071.0,text,,,,self.insomnia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please go easy on me. I&amp;#39;m fully aware coffee is bad. I&amp;#39;m trying to quit. I&amp;#39;m addicted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My doctor seems to say my caffeine intake is not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is. 
I drink a half pot of coffee a day. I start at midnight because my sleep schedule now fubar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start my night a of sleep around 9 pm. 
Wake up at 11 ish. 
I&amp;#39;ll have a cup of coffee if I can&amp;#39;t sleep again. Which is normal. 
 I&amp;#39;ll sleep from 2am to 3am. Again then. Get up and repeat. Sleep again from 5 to 6 and repeat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 am is usually my last cup. 
 And I&amp;#39;m done . So thats 14 hours of no caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pass out again by 7 to 9 pm. As I can&amp;#39;t even function. Because I&amp;#39;ve been doing this ritual for a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to not get up at 11 pm ish and have coffee. 
It works occasionally. And it&amp;#39;s getting slight more and more often they I&amp;#39;m able to sleep more. But it&amp;#39;s really difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#39;t seem to sleep more than 2 hours at a time no matter what. And it&amp;#39;s been like this for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 sleep studies. No apnea. 
Again doctors are fully aware of my coffee habit and insist it&amp;#39;s not an issue as long as I&amp;#39;m not having caffeine past a certain time. 🤷‍♀️ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m struggling with this. 
I&amp;#39;m having a gut feeling it might be causing some insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said. I have had issues on and of for years before this habit started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting off this caffeine has been one of the hardest things I&amp;#39;ve done in a long time. The migraines alone are terrible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways. &lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,"I have not done a sleep study or received an official diagnosis of insomnia, but for the past few weeks, I have not been sleeping well at all and I am exhausted. I don’t know what to do anymore. In researching online, the closest thing I could find to what I am experiencing is something called sleep interruption insomnia.

I have been under a tremendous amount of stress due to ongoing grief over the loss of my dad last year, an impending move from my childhood home to a new place where I really don’t want to be, as well as an ongoing difficult situation with my older sister, who has been verbally and emotionally abusive for a long time and is part of the reason for my move. Trying to move on my own has proven very difficult and I don’t really have any help. It is taking much longer to pack up and move things than it would if I had help and is making everything so much harder.

I assume all of the stress and anxiety is responsible for my lack of sleep and that until things settle down and my life is totally in order, I will not be completely free from the stress. I can’t keep going without proper sleep, though, and don’t know what to do in the meantime.

Lately, I have been getting maybe 2-3 hours of sleep a night, if that, and it’s very poor quality sleep, not restful. Normally, I zonk out at night and ***maybe*** get up once to use the bathroom, but am able to go back to sleep relatively quickly and wake up at a normal time. Now, I will wake up sometime between 1:45 and 2:45 and never be able to fall back asleep, tossing and turning trying to get comfortable, but not being able to. I try to get up and walk around, get a sip of water or read for a little bit, but nothing is working. My mind isn’t racing the way some people have said theirs do when they can’t sleep, but I do feel on edge and unable to fully relax.

And despite being so tired in the daytime, I can’t really fall asleep for a nap then, either.

Has anyone else here experienced something similar? How long did it take you to feel better? What ended up helping you sleep?

Did you just have to tough it out or did you take medication? I really don’t want to have to take medication if there’s an alternative, but I don’t know what to try. I have read some things about magnesium spray and putting it on your feet at night, but I’m skeptical of that. I’ve also had friends recommend taking melatonin or magnesium glycinate, but I don’t know much about either of those supplements and don’t want to take something  that would have unpleasant side effects.

Any suggestions?

,insomnia,"I've tired a lot of different sleep medications out there and have slowly been keeping track of what works and what doesn't. I will continue to update as I try new ones. I will also try and add notes from various doctors.

I’ve had horrible Insomnia since high-school although they wouldn’t give me anything until I started college. I’ve since have tried almost everything out there.

My goal with this is to help people who have insomnia and are looking for anecdotal reports of what I personally have tried and comments of people who have also tried to help people become more educated. Good sleep doctors are hard to find and General Practitioners will just prescribe what they know and rarely have enough education on the topic to think about other types of drugs. **This is purely anecdotal and not meant to be a reliable medical resource.**



# Sleep Schedule:

* I try to get to bed every day around 10pm except weekend around 11-12. I generally wake up around 8am
* I try and limit my phone time after 9pm and will just watch TV in a dimly lit room, some people have suggested to try and read 
* The one thing I have to stay away from is anything that will make me ""think"". What I mean by that is something that makes my brain run thinking about what I just read or watched or stess. So I stay away from work emails, or TV shows that are new/deep, I like to watch shows that I've seen already so I know what is going to happen limiting my brain from thinking through possible outcomes. Usually easy to watch shows are the best (The office, parks and rec, etc). 

# Prescription:

**Z-Drugs:**

* Ambien - Works wonders for the first 4 hours than I wake up but long term studies show it has a lot of potential side effects
* Lunesta - Works wonders for me
* Sonata

**Anti-Depressant:**

* Trazadone
* Mirtazapine
* Doxepin

**Orexin:**

* Belsomra - Can be expensive even with insurance
* Davigo - Causes me to have excessive daytime sleepiness

**Benzos:**

* Xanax - Very addictive and should not be used long term
* Valium - Very addictive and should not be used long term

**Melatonin-Like:**

* Rozerem - didn't really do anything for me

**Anxiolytics:**

* Buspirone - used in combination with Mirtazepin and showed initial signs of helping but lost if effectives quickly

**Alpha Blockers:**

* Prazosin - did wonders for my PTSD nightmares

**Anti-Histamines:**

* Benadryl - Would not recommend to anyone except when you have an allergic reaction, reading up on how bad it can be for you body scares me for anyone who takes it regularly
* Zyrtec - It has been shown to cause slight drowsiness in some people and why a lot of people take it at night for daily allergies.

**Antihypertensives:**

* Clonidine - seems to work well but getting it prescribed off label for sleep has never worked

**Anticonvulsants:**

* Gabapentin - Was originally prescribed this after my 2nd knee surgery for nerve pain but seemed to help a bit with sleep

**Muscles Relaxants:**

* Carisoprodol (SOMA) - did nothing for me and didn't like the feeling of it.
* Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) - gave me the worst hang-overs but did put me to sleep

# Herbal (different combinations):

* THC/CBD
* Valerian Root
* L-Theanine
* Kava kava
* Ashwagandha
* Melatonin
* Gaba
* Sleepy-Time Tea (chamomile, lemon grass, spearmint)
* Tryptophan

# 

# What I like:

* I found Z-drugs are the best as far as forcing yourself to sleep and can give a good amount of sleep but sometimes causes memory issues if I take them for too many days in a row, but is my favorite. Ambien is my go to, then Lunesta and don’t really like Sonata that much
* I have had some success with Belsomra but needs to be a higher dosage and it still is a very costly drug. I just started Davigo a week ago and I think I like it better than Belsomra but I noticed it now is causing excessive sleepiness during the day
* I’ve had PTSD and I found the Prazosin is a staple for not having nightmares plus does help with sleep although if you wake up on it to go pee or something you are in a haze in the middle of the night
* Recently have been trying Buspirone and it seems to really solve one of my bigger sleep issues where I can’t stop thinking when I got to bed but it seems to be losing its effectiveness
* Of the herbal supplements I found that combining Ashgwhanda, L-Theanine , and Kava as a blend has been the best herbal combination I’ve found. The key is to get the dosages of each tuned in. I’ve found that 300mg of Ashgwhanda, 200mg of L-Theanine, 200mg of Kava Kava
* Clonidine mixed with another sleep drug like Rozerem or one of the anti-depressants seems to have a decent effect

# What I won’t use again:

* I do like Xanax before bed but do not want to get addicted and also the potential of mixing with other drugs/Alcohol is too dangerous
* All of the anti-depressant class of drugs even though its a low dose, I get very little sedative effects and really doesn’t do much for me
* THC/CBD sleep blends - they help that much for sleep and give me a lot of side-effects that I do not like, it seems to also give me bad nightmares, but these have all been in pre-prepared preperations with other herbs in them. I am going to try just gummies with nothing else in them to see if it has a better affect
* I don’t like using anti-histamines like Benadryl which is in a lot of sleep formulations, it leaves me with a terrible hang-over type feeling.
* Muscle Relaxers - they seemed to give me horrific hangovers and didn't like the body feeling they gave
* One thing I do pay attention to is sexual dysfunction - some of these drugs but its hard to pinpoint can cause sexual dysfunction/ED issues that cause a lot of stress in home life. Trying to find the ones that do not have any known issues with this.

I’d be happy to answer or give my opinions. My girlfriend jokes that I have a pharmacy of sleep drugs in my nightstand.... which is quite true to be honest,

# Suggestions I’ve gotten are:

* Stalopam/Celexa 
* Phenergan 
* Triazolam 
* Etizolam
* Seroquel
* Ambien ER - I've tried normal ambien and it knocks me out but I wake up after 4 hours and try to get back to sleep but have a hard time, so maybe ER will help

# Wanting to try:

* Quviviq
* Promethazine

# What I am currently On:

I have been trying two different regiments. I usually try for a week on a set of drugs/combinations/dosages to get a good feel for if it has potential to work, if it works, or if there are side effects

* Dayvigo - 5mg nightly, and I am stopping this one because I get excessive tiredness through out the day to the point where I am almost nodding off at certain points of the day. It has caused concern for my significant other and even had her speculate if I was taking other drugs.
* Buspirone (15mg) + Mirtazapine(8mg) - Initially at Busp at 10mg and Mirtazapineat 4mg it showed some relief but quickly faded and the doctor upped my dosage to Busp at 10mg and Mirtazapine tp 8mh and again showed dwindly help, so now at 15mg of Busp and 8mg of Mirtazapine. Overall I just don't think this combo is worth it.
* I am going to try and THC/CBD blend that also contain a few other herbs like Ashgwanda and L-theanine, to see if the provides some relief.

# Doctors Notes:

* More and more doctors are fearful of my age and also of controlled substances. I don't personally think Orexin based sleep meds should be in the controlled group of medications but General Practitioners know less about those drugs than a lot of people on here.
* Ambien and Lunesta are easily the best drugs I've used but are harder and harder to get prescribed. The various combinations of low dose anti depressants seem to be the go to for almost every doctor I've been to for sleep and it scares me more that fact they I am put on an anti-depressant vs something made for sleep. I understand the dosage is low enough to not have the anti-depressant effects but I don't like changing my brain chemistry
* When I go to a new sleep specialist they all want to perform sleep studies, after doing the first I would rather them just read the notes from the original doctor. I have a feeling a lot of them want to do it for the insurance payout and also potentially to cover themselves for providing specific drugs.
* The only way my GP prescribes Ambien is if I am going on a work trip or a long haul vacation flight
* I have a psychiatrist but he doesn't specialize in sleep medication just for ADHD and refuses to prescribe any sleep medications and my insurance won't pay for two doctors, so I am stuck with either the crappy online tele-health doctors or my GP who is more worried about my age then my need for sleep.
* Getting off-label drugs like Clonidine, Gabapentin, and others for off-label sleep is a nightmare, you need a doctor who truly understands how this has potential but is rare to find.",[],False,,0,False,Continually Updated List of Medications I've Tired:,[],r/insomnia,False,,,0,,False,t3_1fxpwd1,False,dark,0.97,,public,42,0,{},,False,,False,False,,{},,False,42,,False,,1728248439.0,,{},,True,,1728246135.0,text,,,,self.insomnia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tired a lot of different sleep medications out there and have slowly been keeping track of what works and what doesn&amp;#39;t.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Histamines:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benadryl - Would not recommend to anyone except when you have an allergic reaction, reading up on how bad it can be for you body scares me for anyone who takes it regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zyrtec - It has been shown to cause slight drowsiness in some people and why a lot of people take it at night for daily allergies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antihypertensives:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clonidine - seems to work well but getting it prescribed off label for sleep has never worked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticonvulsants:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gabapentin - Was originally prescribed this after my 2nd knee surgery for nerve pain but seemed to help a bit with sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muscles Relaxants:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carisoprodol (SOMA) - did nothing for me and didn&amp;#39;t like the feeling of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) - gave me the worst hang-overs but did put me to sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Herbal (different combinations):&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;THC/CBD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valerian Root&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L-Theanine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kava kava&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melatonin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaba&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleepy-Time Tea (chamomile, lemon grass, spearmint)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tryptophan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What I like:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found Z-drugs are the best as far as forcing yourself to sleep and can give a good amount of sleep but sometimes causes memory issues if I take them for too many days in a row, but is my favorite. Ambien is my go to, then Lunesta and don’t really like Sonata that much&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have had some success with Belsomra but needs to be a higher dosage and it still is a very costly drug. I just started Davigo a week ago and I think I like it better than Belsomra but I noticed it now is causing excessive sleepiness during the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve had PTSD and I found the Prazosin is a staple for not having nightmares plus does help with sleep although if you wake up on it to go pee or something you are in a haze in the middle of the night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently have been trying Buspirone and it seems to really solve one of my bigger sleep issues where I can’t stop thinking when I got to bed but it seems to be losing its effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of the herbal supplements I found that combining Ashgwhanda, L-Theanine , and Kava as a blend has been the best herbal combination I’ve found. The key is to get the dosages of each tuned in. I’ve found that 300mg of Ashgwhanda, 200mg of L-Theanine, 200mg of Kava Kava&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clonidine mixed with another sleep drug like Rozerem or one of the anti-depressants seems to have a decent effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What I won’t use again:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do like Xanax before bed but do not want to get addicted and also the potential of mixing with other drugs/Alcohol is too dangerous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the anti-depressant class of drugs even though its a low dose, I get very little sedative effects and really doesn’t do much for me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;THC/CBD sleep blends - they help that much for sleep and give me a lot of side-effects that I do not like, it seems to also give me bad nightmares, but these have all been in pre-prepared preperations with other herbs in them. I am going to try just gummies with nothing else in them to see if it has a better affect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t like using anti-histamines like Benadryl which is in a lot of sleep formulations, it leaves me with a terrible hang-over type feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle Relaxers - they seemed to give me horrific hangovers and didn&amp;#39;t like the body feeling they gave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One thing I do pay attention to is sexual dysfunction - some of these drugs but its hard to pinpoint can cause sexual dysfunction/ED issues that cause a lot of stress in home life. Trying to find the ones that do not have any known issues with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d be happy to answer or give my opinions. My girlfriend jokes that I have a pharmacy of sleep drugs in my nightstand.... which is quite true to be honest,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Suggestions I’ve gotten are:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stalopam/Celexa &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phenergan &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triazolam &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etizolam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seroquel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ambien ER - I&amp;#39;ve tried normal ambien and it knocks me out but I wake up after 4 hours and try to get back to sleep but have a hard time, so maybe ER will help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wanting to try:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quviviq&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promethazine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What I am currently On:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying two different regiments. I usually try for a week on a set of drugs/combinations/dosages to get a good feel for if it has potential to work, if it works, or if there are side effects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dayvigo - 5mg nightly, and I am stopping this one because I get excessive tiredness through out the day to the point where I am almost nodding off at certain points of the day. It has caused concern for my significant other and even had her speculate if I was taking other drugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buspirone (15mg) + Mirtazapine(8mg) - Initially at Busp at 10mg and Mirtazapineat 4mg it showed some relief but quickly faded and the doctor upped my dosage to Busp at 10mg and Mirtazapine tp 8mh and again showed dwindly help, so now at 15mg of Busp and 8mg of Mirtazapine. Overall I just don&amp;#39;t think this combo is worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am going to try and THC/CBD blend that also contain a few other herbs like Ashgwanda and L-theanine, to see if the provides some relief.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Doctors Notes:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More and more doctors are fearful of my age and also of controlled substances. I don&amp;#39;t personally think Orexin based sleep meds should be in the controlled group of medications but General Practitioners know less about those drugs than a lot of people on here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ambien and Lunesta are easily the best drugs I&amp;#39;ve used but are harder and harder to get prescribed. The various combinations of low dose anti depressants seem to be the go to for almost every doctor I&amp;#39;ve been to for sleep and it scares me more that fact they I am put on an anti-depressant vs something made for sleep. I understand the dosage is low enough to not have the anti-depressant effects but I don&amp;#39;t like changing my brain chemistry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I go to a new sleep specialist they all want to perform sleep studies, after doing the first I would rather them just read the notes from the original doctor. I have a feeling a lot of them want to do it for the insurance payout and also potentially to cover themselves for providing specific drugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only way my GP prescribes Ambien is if I am going on a work trip or a long haul vacation flight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a psychiatrist but he doesn&amp;#39;t specialize in sleep medication just for ADHD and refuses to prescribe any sleep medications and my insurance won&amp;#39;t pay for two doctors, so I am stuck with either the crappy online tele-health doctors or my GP who is more worried about my age then my need for sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting off-label drugs like Clonidine, Gabapentin, and others for off-label sleep is a nightmare, you need a doctor who truly understands how this has potential but is rare to find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

My insomnia is very simple, I never sleep despite total exhaustion even if at the beginning, I surprised myself by having sleepless nights without really being tired except for burning eyes. I have tried all the classic prescription drugs for insomnia, even recently qviviq. Nothing has worked except seroquel which until today saves his life even if it does not work every day and the sleep obtained is far from being of quality. I had 2 polysomnographies and I was diagnosed with sleep apnea bordering on severe (29/h) but I don't worry about it because my problem is falling asleep. I also had 28 micro-awakenings of non-respiratory origin. Without medication, I don't sleep except for a few episodes of drowsiness that I'm not aware of, that is to say that I fall asleep for maybe 10 minutes 2-3 times in the morning but most of the time, it's a sleepless night. Unlike when I started my insomnia, I can no longer stand sleepless nights or poor quality sleep and I have some pretty crazy body disorders like excessive sweating, excessive urination, unexplained numbness/tingling in both arms regardless of the position.

I tried to take my antidepressant paroxetine again but it made the hyper-arousal state worse. I tried venlafaxine and lexapro but in vain... I tried CBT-I but I don't seem to react even if I can't hold on long enough because of exhaustion. There is only one parameter that seems to improve my sleep, it's when I'm sick, when I catch a bad cold and the nervous system is tired/calmer.

Everything is good on the blood tests except the high iron saturation coefficient and the uric acid too low. I had MRIs and scans, nothing.

The heart rate is low, no shortness of breath.

I know I'm forgetting a lot of things but do you have any leads, friends? I can't live like this anymore, I no longer have a professional life, a love life, etc...

I'm not asking to be cured but simply to understand what's happening and improve the situation a little, no more no less for the moment.

I will try propranolol soon to see what the adrenaline is like.

I can't live like this anymore, thank you for listening and helping me, I will add details as soon as they come back to me because I know I forgot 2-3 important things.

,insomnia,"Hi, 27f here

In June I started experiencing sensations in my body (headaches, chest pains, shortness of breath, rapid heart beat) that kept causing huge panic attacks. A lot of these panic attacks happened either
1. when I was alone in my room, doing a hobby
2. when I woke up, also alone in my room
3. right before trying to sleep. also alone in my room lol

Because of the way my body felt, I legitimately thought I was going to die, and it seemed to get worse with each panic attack. De realization set in, I lost my ability to sleep for days at a time, kept having panic attacks while trying to sleep. Etc. I started having family members share a bed with me every night, and I haven’t slept alone since July.

To make a long story short, after 2 ER visits, many tests and wearing a heart monitor for 2 weeks, and a trip to the doctor, it turns out that I’m severely iron deficient and had way too much Vitamin D in my system. I was given hydroxyzine, which I’ve taken and had success with a handful of times, but I don’t like how it makes me feel the next day and would rather not take medication to get over this problem.

What I need advice for is this.
This whole thing has put me in a very terrible state. I’m afraid of my bedroom. I’m afraid of going to sleep alone. When I go in there and try to do any of the things I love to do, or try to sleep on my own, I feel consumed by dread and anxiety, and it makes me feel depressed in that I wish this whole debacle never happened. I don’t want to have to change my room or sleep with someone else for the rest of my life, I value my independence, and now it’s terrifying to be on my own. Ive been trying to take steps towards exposure and therefor recovery; I’ve slept alone about 4-5 times since, and I’ve been trying to spend more time in my room doing the things I usually do, but I hate the way it all feels so far. It doesnt help that I had an issue just like this way earlier in life and while I was able to overcome it, it’s excruciating for me to face the reality of it having come back.

Has anyone ever had an issue like this, and how have you overcome it? Please note that I’m really not interested in medication and therapy unfortunately isn’t that accessible in my state with the insurance that I have. How do I break these associations? Am I on the right track? Any hope? I’m having a pretty hard time recovering because of this.

,insomnia,"Hi,

I am 33M, 5'8"" and 134 lbs. HRV of 45 ms. Resting Heart Rate 53 bpm on avg.

I believe I am suffering from sleep maintenance Insomnia because I wake up multiple times a night, every night. For example, if I go to bed at 10 p.m., I would wake up sometime between 12 a.m. and 3:30 a.m., struggle to fall back a sleep for an hour or two, get back to sleep for an hour or so, wake up again, repeat this in short intervals between 30 min\~60 min until I finally get up around 5\~6 a.m.

I use Oura ring as my sleep tracker, and my total sleep is around 6.5 hours, but the problem is, this 6.5 hours is comprised of fragmented sleep (2 hour here, 1 hour here, 30 min here, etc.).

Things I have tried so far:

1. Turn off electricity 2 hours before sleep (around 8 p.m.)
2. Take a warm shower 1\~2 hours before sleep.
3. Take magnesium at night
4. Drink AG1 in the morning
5. Exercise during the day (25 min of cardio or weightlifting)
6. Reading a book an hour or two before sleep
7. No caffeine or alcohol ever
8. Finish eating 3\~4 hours before sleep.
9. When I wake up, go outside and get natural sunlight for 20\~30 min each day
10. No naps
11. If I wake up in the middle of the night, I don't lie in bed awake if I can't fall back asleep in 20 min. I get out and read a book or something.
12. Avoid processed food.

These things are definitely good habits, but not really solved my sleep maintenance insomnia.

I can fall asleep fine usually in 20 min, but I always wake up, mostly from REM sleep because I can remember the dream as soon as I wake up.

,insomnia,"(20M) Hey guys so I’ve been dealing with numerous sleep issues for a while now. So these past 3 days I have had the worst sleep of my entire life. I am waking up every 2-3 hours in the night, and then struggling to fall back asleep after that. I have always had sleeping issues but this is where I have to draw a line. 

So the main thing I’m leaning towards and hoping, is that it’s just nicotine withdrawal. I have been a vaper for the past year and I’m quitting cold turkey (not my first time) today marks day 7 since I’ve put it down and I’m assuming that’s a part of it. 

BUT I don’t want to leave out any potential other isssues that may be causing this. I eat good and my lifestyle is not unhealthy. I stay active. I’m 20 years old, 6”4 and 200lbs so I’m not overweight at all. 

As for my setup I have blackout blinds in my room, a fan blowing, and occasional music I play. I never wake up due too noise happening, it’s always something else.

I also drinks lots of water and I used to wake up too pee at least twice a night. Another issues I’m leaning towards would be a bladder related issue or something along those lines. 

For my bedtime routine I try to go to bed before midnight. Some times it almost seems like I have too be absolutely exhausted just too fall asleep. I’ve been taking 200mg of magnesium but in the past week I upped it too 400mg before bed. I don’t take any medications.

,insomnia,"Hello to all my fellow non-sleepers. My doctor is really pissing me off because she refuses to let me try. Just you know that you’re one of the Maile and or Lunesta. I feel like every time a doctor tries to prescribe me a drug for sleep. It has to be like some kind of antipsychotic or some kind of drug that also has psychological effects speaking of which Seroquel used to be a wonder drug for me when it came to sleep, although a terrible drug when it came to trying to wake up, it used to only take 25 mg of Seroquel to knock me out for a night now I’m up to taking 400 mg of Seroquel along with 100 mg of doxepin. Neither drug is doing anything for me. The only time during the month that I can sleep is at the beginning of the month when I fill my Xanax Prescription and I take my prescribed dose of Xanax at night and that gets me to sleep however, this is an issue for me because it doesn’t leave me with Xanax to take for when I actually need it for anxiety and I have generalized anxiety as well as OCD so it’s important for me to have that Xanax bearable to me in case of extreme anxiety or panic attack attacks, and I hate that I have to rely on Xanax to sleep and with the dose that my doctor gives me it only last about half the month if I take it every night for sleep. My doctor gave me this bullshit about how she doesn’t want to prescribe Ambien or Lunesta because they’re also benzos and she doesn’t want me on another benzo, but I know for a fact that Ambien is not a benzodiazepine like Xanax. And I don’t know why she insist on me keeping up with trying this doc to him because even after she upped the dose to 100 mg it has had absolutely zero effect. I have taken Seroquel at various dosage since 2009 and it has always worked until the beginning of this year and now I’ve yet to find anything that will put me to sleep like Seroquel used to. I need a drug that just turns my mind off and makes me fall asleep at the end of the day because if I don’t have that regardless of how tired I am when I try to go to sleep my mind just races and I just can’t sleep. I know I mentioned about that. Sometimes Xanax helps me get to sleep even though I don’t like to take it at night every night to sleep if I can avoid it, but even then, Xanax in of itself, doesn’t really make me drowsy or tired. It just does calm down my thoughts a little bit and gives me a much better chance of falling asleep, but I don’t ever even sleep through the night so the little bit of relief that I am getting through Xanax is helping me to fall asleep sometimes but not helping me sleep through the night and like I said I don’t want to be taking my Xanax to sleep? I like to reserve my Xanax for when I truly need it for anxiety. It’s not something that I want to take every day that’s not the plan for it. Then my doctor mentioned something to me like maybe I should do a sleep study cause I have sleep apnea or something and I’m like no I don’t have sleep apnea. I don’t have a snoring or breathing problem or something that’s interfering with my sleep after I fall asleep I just can’t fall asleep And it’s driving me crazy it’s ruining my life that I can’t rely on a drug like circle anymore to get me to sleep when I need to go to sleep. 

Please, if you have tried any other drugs or if you have any suggestions for me or if your doctors have put you on other medications that have worked for you in the past or now please please offer up some advice. I am desperate for a solution to get me to start falling and going to sleep consistently and sleeping through the night.

It caused me to end up with bad insomnia. Im beginning to wonder how much longer I should or need to take it since it’s helped me so much during this time. I personally know people who have been on it for months even years due to health issues. 

I’m really wondering to myself do I keep taking until I feel more regulated and have more control over my mental and physical issues since the sleep Ambien does provide me has helped me immensely with my issues that started 3 months ago. I’ve never had any bad side effects from Ambien. 

Also I read SO much conflicting information about how to stop taking or tapering Ambien if I do try to. I’m on the controlled release version of Ambien so it can’t be cut/split like in half. I’ve read online about many people who just quit cold turkey after taking it for weeks or months and with no issue. My doctor said it’s ok to stop cold turkey since I’ve haven’t been taking it a long time (just 5-6 weeks) but he’s pretty laid back when it comes to that kind of stuff. But then I read online that you have to taper off….but it doesn’t ever say or mention “how long” someone was on Ambien that requires you to have to taper off of it. In other posts I’ve read taking it for just 1-3 months especially at a low dose is nothing to even be super worried about. Is it really required to taper off low dose controlled release Ambien after just 1-2 months? 

My other issue is I don’t even have the version of Ambien that you can even taper off of if I wanted to because it’s the controlled release version and it says it can’t be cut or split. So I don’t know how I would even taper off if I wanted to?

I would really truly appreciate some sound friendly solid advice from anyone who has taken Ambien and was in a similar position as me. 

Thanks 🙏

Ever since I was a young child I always struggled with sleep. When I was a baby my parents struggled to get me to go to sleep. Throughout my childhood I would stay up very late in order to fall asleep. 

Now as an adult I’m suffering from chronic insomnia. My issue is that I don’t always have insomnia. Like for periods of time (like for a few months) I get good sleep and I feel good. However, it suddenly changes and then I get chronic insomnia for months at a time. It’s like on and off. 

Another big issue I’ve been dealing with for years is my sleep rhythm. For example, if I have to wake up at 6am multiple days in a row. Then for the next several weeks I will wake up at exactly 6am and be wide awake even when I don’t need to wake up at that time.  

Most times I start off falling asleep well and then I’ll wake up by 3am and can never go back to sleep. So I spend most of my time on my phone, which I know doesn’t help at all.This lack of sleep is really ruining me. Especially with all the stress in my life right now I absolutely need to get a good night’s rest. 

On top of all this I have Hashimoto’s, fibromyalgia, and other health conditions that just make it worse and the lack of sleep makes my symptoms so much worse. 

It used to get better with exercise. Like if I did an intense workout a few hours before bed it would typically help me to fall asleep but now that no longer works. 

I have gotten EEGs for neurologists in the past but I guess they all came out fine. I honestly have a really hard time with doctors cause they never believe me or undermine my symptoms.

,insomnia,"Last night, I posted on several subreddits about my unusual sleep condition. Upon reading the responses, I was moved to tears by the effort, time, and compassion that so many of you invested in providing advice. After reviewing numerous comments and excellent suggestions, it became clear that finding the right doctor or medical team specializing in hard-to-treat severe insomnia is crucial.

To summarize, I have experienced sleep issues since infancy. I have always struggled to fall asleep and have never slept deeply. As I grew older, the insomnia became more severe, leading to episodes where I stay awake for days without sleep, although physicians do not believe I am manic. During these episodes—which now occur weekly—I am extremely exhausted, barely able to move or think, yet I am unable to fall asleep.

I have undergone two overnight sleep studies and daytime studies, both including polysomnography (PSG) and next-day Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (MSLT). I have completed 12 weeks of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). In terms of medications and supplements, there are few that I have not tried. I have taken all the Z-drugs (e.g., Ambien, Lunesta), melatonin agonists like Ramelteon, and traditional sedative antidepressants such as trazodone, doxepin, and mirtazapine, among others. I have also tried THC/CBN gummies, various over-the-counter sleep supplements, and research chemicals like phenibut—all without success.

The physicians I have consulted often do not recall the last medication they prescribed me and tend to simply nod before writing another prescription. The only doctor who has shown me compassion is my primary care physician. He shared that he was diagnosed with sleep apnea during medical school and that, before starting CPAP therapy, those were the most challenging years of his life because he blamed himself for always being tired and not performing at his best. While our situations are different, he was the first to reassure me that it is not my fault and that there is something deeper going on. Despite all the doctors agreeing that it is not mania, they have been unable to provide assistance.

I am reaching out to inquire if anyone knows of a sleep specialist, neurologist, or medical team that addresses challenging cases. I am willing to travel anywhere in the country or world; I am fortunate to have two amazing parents who would do anything to help me lead a more normal life.

,insomnia,"When I have a night where I sleep better I always feel really tired and sluggish in the morning, like I don’t wanna get out of bed and my mood throughout the day is always not as good.

However on a night where I sleep awfully, maybe don’t even sleep at all I feel raring to go in the morning, straight out of bed like I imagine is the way you SHOULD feel in a morning. My mood throughout the day is better, euphoric at times. The downsides being it comes with the cons of bad sleep, headaches at points, feel dizzy later on and get really tired in the late afternoon/evening but I definitely feel happier.

So this is quite an odd phenomenon and I believe it’s something to do with REM sleep, though there could be a bit more to it than that.

Makes me consider, perhaps I am an oversleeper and my body essentially forced insomnia onto me to balance things out because chronically I had slept too much and it was an issue?

Because historically I’ve always felt tired in the morning and felt like I don’t sleep good yet I sleep from like 9 - 7, in previous years it would be even earlier around 8. This is 10 hours in bed, I wasn’t one to wake up in the night either and I would be tired throughout the day and have to nap another 30 mins in the day.

I’m sleeping again now but since my insomnia happened it’s impossible for me to stay in bed beyond 6, I wake probably just before that, I don’t know how describe it, pretty sure it’s cortisol spiking that makes this happen so perhaps my cortisol has started rising earlier.

But on the nights where I sleep a bit better and have no disturbance, waking and go to bed earlier I wake at the same time but I feel sluggish and don’t wanna get out of bed.

My mom is going to get me &amp;quot;herbal tablets&amp;quot; to help me sleep.
The teachers have noticed as well, which isn&amp;#39;t good&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t do this anymore it&amp;#39;s killing me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Thank you to everyone who has tried helping me. It really means a lot. I just wanted to say that I slept well last night for the first time in a while, and I&amp;#39;m very proud of myself &lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,"I’ve been dealing with this issue for about 4 years since getting covid. No matter what I do to manage all my symptoms, sleep is my #1 trigger. If I sleep 6.5 hours or less it’s impossible to feel better and I am bed bound all day.  If I sleep 7.5 hours or more I feel 20x better.



7.5+ hours or sleep:

- can be upright 90% of the day

- can do my usual chores like driving, shopping, cooking and computer work. I will get sensory issues and brain fog but fatigue is mild.

- need maybe 3-4 flat 10 minute rest breaks



6.5 hours or less:

- typically I will wakeup too early and feel wired and unable to fall back asleep. Then over the next hour the symptoms turn into the following below:

- can be upright 10% of the day. 

- cant do chores. cant work on computer. all day I have extreme bone crushing fatigue and weakness all over my body. It hurts to move my arms, my fingers, my eyes, my face. It feels like I am paralyzed. 

- this happens even when I stay in bed all day in a dark room. Being upright for even a minute is hell. I push through it to make food for myself but other than that I am in bed all day.

I have MCAS, POTS, EDS, MECFS all diagnosed. Its such a struggle to sleep good because I am constantly waking up and having trouble falling back asleep. I go pee multiple times per night. Am dying of thirst or salt always. So then it just takes 1 hour of missed sleep to disable me for the entire day to the point its painful and tiring to exist. This of course causes some bad depersonalization derealization and panic. So of course I am worried about missing any sleep. Its ruined alot of important days in my life like my 6 year anniversary with my girlfriend. It’s impossible to work. I used to be able to function on even 5 hours but this is insane and terrifying.

I need a solution for the next day that can possibly mitigate the extreme weakness and fatigue. I am not looking for sleep meds.

,insomnia,"New to group,so not sure if this is an annoying post but I don’t know where else to turn to right now.

Been dealing with insomnia for the past couple years . It’s gotten worse and worse over time which I’m sure is probably not unusual. I also deal with panic disorder and panic attacks which has not helped either.

Long story short I am supposed to have lunch with my Uncle today at noon (it’s 8:52am right now) and I haven’t slept. This is a very important lunch to me, I don’t get to see my uncle often and we have had a very unique and special relationship ever since my dad (his brother) passed away. 

I am sick to my stomach, literally. Head pounding, been trying new sleep aids this week and not sure if that’s what’s hurting my stomach or the nerves/stress/anxiety/agony of the overwhelming feeling and realization that I’m probably going to cancel or even hopefully just try to reschedule our lunch. 

It I wasn’t physically feeling this awful and I was just tired I would probably try and push through but even then I’d be worried my chances of having a panic attack at lunch with him would be even greater and I’d ruin our limited time together anyway.

He knows something’s going on with me but does not know the extent and having to call him and explain everything at 9 in the morning is daunting and honestly just too much for me right now 

I know he’d understand and even though he might be disappointed for a little bit I know he wouldn’t want me to be driving myself this crazy over a lunch but it was soooo important to me. Still is.

I think what I’m most worried about is letting myself down again and having to live with it. I hate this so much and I don’t have many people to talk about it with. I feel like I’m going crazy to be honest, it’s so isolating.

I guess I don’t have an ultimate question here as I know what I have to do but the anxiety of typing that message and pressing send feels like the flap of a butterfly’s wings and in the end a domino effect of regret, shame and embarrassment I’m not ready for. 

I know probably a lot of you here have it worse than me &amp; my heart goes out to you, truly it does. Please please go easy on me - I mean no disrespect with my small issue here today. I guess I just needed to vent and maybe get some feedback if you feel like it- thank you😔

dont get me wrong, this is way better than continuously waking up and i feel more rested but i feel like its not enough.

anyone ever had a similar experience or has suggestions? it would help a lot, thanks :)&lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,"Last night I finally realized that I have REALLY bad sleep anxiety over wanting to get to sleep and not wanting to feel so fatigued the next day. If this happens on some nights, I would literally just toss and turn for 30 minutes, get annoyed and my body starts to feel on edge. Then I'll get up, take a piss, maybe listen to ambient music for 10 minutes and then try to sleep again.

Usually that works. But how do I start stopping this weird *on edge* feeling that courses throughout my body. Which is ofc anxiety. I tell myself that it's okay to have a sleepless night or 2. And that I've done it before. But I still feel this rush of panic. 

Really want to hit a more natural solution before I SSRI up.

More importantly. What do I think of while trying to distract my brain. It seems like action and exciting scenarios zaps my brain and gives me a hypnic jerk if I do that. Any nice soothing mental distractions I can do while laying down? My brain loves to get distracted on mental imagery. And that's when I usually conk out. But I need soothing imagery. Should I think about my hobbies? My collections? If it's something too generic, then I can't really get into it.

,insomnia,"For one year I’ve had horrible anxiety about sleeping. I’ve had horrible anxiety about prionic diseases SFI and FFI. As I write this I am mostly coherent. Anytime someone would mention them and use “you”, or “you won’t sleep tonight” any phrase like that would tick my ocd. But I got over it for the most part. That’s freshman year college. One week I had mild flu like symptoms. Listen clearly. After a fun night with my friends I felt horribly tired. I went to bed feeling fine. Got up anxious. I had trouble maintains my temperature, hot and cold weather, I felt weak and tired, but my wisdom teeth didn’t actually hurt that much. Yes they were infected I could tell by the smell. I believed it was from my wisdom teeth. I took antibiotics and instantly felt better. Wondering if it was placebo or not. Then.. all of sudden I start getting similar symptoms again. At first I thought it as antibiotic resistantance maybe because I stopped taking it for two days. So I started retaking them. Felt better till I didn’t. I went to bed again a few days after and felt ridiculously sleepy. I slept great. For like 6-8 hours for at lest two nights. Night before I went back home to cuse to go to emergency doctor to get referred to a dentist because I don’t have one. But the whole day I feel foggy, I’m disassociating, my heart hurts, as if I didn’t sleep. I thought maybe it’s stress and antibiotics. I’ve been taking them for ten days they can cause tremors and panick. But doesn’t explain the symptoms like disassociating and heart pain, I only get when I don’t sleep? Third night I go to bed. Woke up within 2 hours bc I was having hypagonjc hallucinations. Again normal. Had them before Reddit informed me. Panicked but because I panicked all last year about diseases, I forced myself to stay calm and pace a bit I didn’t call my mother like I did when I was kid and had horrible anxiety. Even during football season senior year HS I had anxiety about this very rare possibly. Id go next to my mom and sleep shaking my for three hours then go back to my bed. Any ways, I Woke up feeling horribly tired. This is the third day after I felt like crap despite sleeping fine for two days. Anwyays I Felt sick, and then i was disassociating whole day. Yk It’s fine, I thought maybe because of the melatonin? I haven’t taken it in a while. I took it after mini panick attack the first day in the three day series and slept good, and then took one but not the third day. Those two days prior to the third night where I only slept two hours, I have to admit I felt as I am balding. Prematurely. Most of it probably due to antibiotics and temporary but still causes some stress. My hair and looks matter to me a lot. IHave horrible stess about the event. I decide to work out and fix my stress. I got to bed that night and realized it’s hard for me to fall asleep. I don’t sleep for a while. I take melatonin and get 2 hours of sleep. (This is about the third night.) Parasomnia, maybe for 2 hours I slept. I feel like I was awake and asleep but that’s normal has happened to me before normals with anxiety .Work up trembling. Surprisingly felt better sleep deprived then those two days, where I had slept but I was disassociating for some reason? Anyways fast forward to the night. I’m trembling and ridiculously thirsty. So I get fear about Rabdo. I have had anxiety about rabdo before from crazy lift sesh. I continue to tremble through out the night. My head aches I believe it’s from wisdom teeth. My anxiety is horrid, I’ve never had it this bad. Sure I’ve felt worse but now I feel absolutely horrid. I’m getting up and having tot ale the fattest deep breaths to relax my self. I pop two melatonin’s. I watch some YouTube thinking I’ll pull a double nighther and tweak myself to bed tonight the night afterwards. Then I start to feel tired. I start to feel my body tighten up as if I go to sleep. I start dissociating like the feeling of being outside my body. Then my heartbeat speeds up. Like maybe Gods deciding to take me. I am unsure of what to do I always jerk up in anxiety if I feel like I’m dying but now I’m almost welcoming it? Then the back of my neck starts to hurt. I’ve had a sore back of the neck for a while but today it’s horrid. It’s dropping due to lack of sleep. The pain strengthens and then I suddenly jump up. My mind is clear but I don’t know how long that will be the case. I wonder if my worst fear is the case. Background knowledge earlier that night : I am Muslim and that night as praying to God to protect all my family members from prion diseases but I have ocd so while I was doing it a voice in my mind distracts me saying someone can suffer. I think in my minds voice that, no, nobody will. Thinking it will cancel it out. Now I think back. What could this be. It’s similar description to parasomnia, feeling like my minds awake bjt my body’s asleep except with Parasomnia you actually sleep. I’m awake. Now I’m beyond horrified. The back of my neck hurts so much I wonder if I have CFS leak I was thinking about it a few days ago only found it a few days ago. It’s all happening within seconds. I jolt myself awake and think the worst. What if not have sfi but the possibility of the horribly ffi . I stop stressing and try to relax. I look at a Reddit post of someone who has it he seems compelty coherent. I think of my only symptoms, worst anxiety I’ve ever had, (I’ve had a lot of anxiety in my life so far) I’m having to take deep breaths and I don’t even feel stressed yet I can’t relax. I’m trembling that’s bothering me so much it’s hard for me to sleep, and the dissociation, heart beat rapidly and neck pain while my body was asleep but my mind wide awake. I end up awaking up my roomate, calling my mom, and neither ends up working. I saw today on another post about sfi on Reddit  that a man with FFI knew exactly what was happening to him and he “slept” knowing it did nothing. I am only 19. I wonder if my constant fear and anxiety led to a serious issue.  I thought I had my fear under control but now I wonder. My only other symptom besides these is the jitteriness and shakiness in my hands as I’m typing this and it occurs randomly almost as if it isn’t from anxiety. My body feels hot and cold at the Same time within seconds. I don’t know if I am having the worst anxiety symptoms of my life combined with wisdom teeth pressure and effects of antibiotics amoxicillin for two weeks or if I’m genuinely dying. If I’m dying then this is horrible luck. I wonder what I have done to be liek this. I’m on ft with my mom almost completely coherent coming to terms with the possibly  that one day I might not be. I’ve used this subreddit to cure my anxiety time and time again. Everytime I fear sfi or FFI this sun reddit helped me. I stopped fearing FFI bc ik it was genetic, I stopped fearing sfi bc ik the symptoms didn’t start with insomnia. Now I feel as though I’ve worried myself to death. I will update you guys if I can I don’t know what’s happening to me and I’m trying to not be scared. Two mellys and no avail.  Natrol for kids. Yet not tired. I feel as though I’m at a loss.

,insomnia,"I don't even know when was the last time I got proper sleep, not to mention consecutive nights with proper sleep. 

I'm have this problem for more than 2 months now. I wake up multiple times throughout the night. When I wake up after 4 am it takes a lot of effort for me to fall asleep again. For an example - today I woke up at 4:25 and fell asleep probably around 6. For another 2:25 hrs. I got a total of maximum 6:15-30 hours of sleep. Which was quite a good night. Very often I manage to get only about 5-6 hours.

Physically I'm a fit individual. At least I think I am. ~13% of body fat and I have lifted weights since I was 16 years old. Altough I work from home I manage to get average 5k steps a day. I turnt 23 a month ago. 

The past month I get extremely anxious when lifting weights and I'm forced to leave the gym after just a couple of sets. I'm scared that my heart will stop working because of my lack of sleep and exhaustion. I don't even know if it's possible. I'm scared that I will pass out and never wake up again. I'm not sure if it's possible but I think my anxiety is reflecting and worsening the physical state of mine and I get dizzy / light sensitive / feel like passing out. Is that possible?

I took 3 blood tests in the past 11 months. (only the last doctor appointment was related to this issue). Last one was 3 weeks ago and my doctor included a test for minerals. Blood test came out completely fine... Even the minerals. I also took EKG test 7 months ago which came out fine.  

Anyways deep inside I feel like the root of the problem is my sleep deprivation. Btw I started to go to sleep earlier than I did - I go to bed before 11pm every day now.

Could you please share your thoughts on this with me? I will greatly appreciate your input. And please try to tell me the truth wheter I can pass out &amp; never wake up / collapse / something can go wrong with my heart when sleep deprived.

I take a QUARTER of a 50mg pill (got unpleasant side effects from any larger doses) and I fall asleep within an hour EVERY SINGLE TIME!

I don't have nightmares, or sweats or headaches or anything. One night I got a really stuffy nose but that went away after I ate some food, same with feeling nauseous one night. So now I always take it with a snack

I actually look forward to going to bed now instead of dreading it because I know I'll be asleep soon instead of laying awake in the dark for hours.

,insomnia,"Hi everyone,

I’m curious to hear from people who deal with insomnia but have a flexible job. Do you find it easier to catch up on sleep during the day?

For example, yesterday I woke up at 1:30 am and just stayed up all day. I got the kids to school, worked from home, and powered through. Today was a similar story—I went to bed at 9 pm but woke up at 2 am and couldn't go back to sleep.

I'm wondering if I should just take a sleeping pill tomorrow after dropping the kids off and try to sleep until it’s time to pick them up. I honestly can’t remember the last time I got a full 8 hours of sleep straight through, and it’s starting to catch up with me.

Has anyone had success with napping during the day to make up for lost sleep at night? Or is there something else you’ve tried that worked for you?

,insomnia,"Hello fellow insomniacs- this is my first time ever posting in a reddit thread. 
Im 32 F, suffered from insomnia on and off since I was a baby. (Yes a baby, my mum dropped me to the hospital at 6 weeks old and left me there for a night because I hadn’t slept in 2 days lol)
Because of this I just naturally have low sleep needs compared to others so I function pretty well without sleep.
As an adult my episodes usually only last a couple weeks &amp; majority of the time I can manage through them fairly well.
However I’m currently in the middle of my 7th consecutive week of getting less than 3hrs max of broken sleep, some nights I don’t sleep at all and I’m at the point where I know I need critical intervention before I lose my mind.
Everything my doctors given me so far has not worked- Melatonin, Restavit, Valium, Temazepam, Ativan &amp; the most recent one Zopiclone. 
I also take Targin (endone) morning &amp; night for a back issue which I’m told should help increase the effects of the sleeping meds (which it isn’t).
What am I doing wrong, or what should I ask him to prescribe me to help? The soonest appointment I can get with him isn’t for another day and a half.
Or should I just ask him to write me a letter to take to the hospital and get admitted? 
(I’ve had to do this a few times in the past due to treatment resistant insomnia)

I have an almost 3 yr old daughter who is entirely in my care so I’m not able to make that decision lightly as I would need to find someone in the family to look after her if I need to be admitted. 

Please help &amp; send through advice, medication/medication combo suggestions.

Im 32 F, suffered from insomnia on and off since I was a baby. (Yes a baby, my mum dropped me to the hospital at 6 weeks old and left me there for a night because I hadn’t slept in 2 days lol)
Because of this I just naturally have low sleep needs compared to others so I function pretty well without sleep.

And I am extremely scared of taking anything to help with it. In Spain, I was offered Atarax. I read about the possibilities of it causing a heart arrythmia and the result of that was a panic attack that blew apart my sleep. 

I have similar concerns about diphenhydramine (previously I used it for a few weeks at a time and slept amazingly well)

,insomnia,"Not medical advice.

Had insomnia all my life when trying to adhere to a disgusting morning schedule my body doesn't want. 

I naturally get sleepy at 3am, fall asleep at 4am, wake up at 12pm with no problems but everything in the world hates that schedule.

Had to go to a morning schedule and my body fought it hard. Days of no sleep. Strong dangerous meds. ER visits from days of no sleep. Complete mental breakdowns. Endless pills and endless pills for those side effects.

Rejuvia sleep spray worked for me. I do 5 sprays 2 hours before I want to be asleep. I keep it under my tongue for as long as possible. It quiets my brain and let's me sleep. It's not a forced ugly sleep like unisom and it's more calming than melatonin. 

I still wake up 4 hours later but then I take my Nature Made back to sleep meds which is a chewable made up of melatonin, gaba, theanine, etc and I fall back asleep fast according to my Garmin watch that tracks my sleep.

Its precarious but working for me so I figured I'd share the info. It's not a miracle thing, you still have to do all the usual shit, no sugar after lunch, no caffeine after lunch, regular sleep schedule, quiet room, deep brown noise or whatever sound helps you sleep, look up foods that cause anxiety and don't eat them after lunch, etc. 

There's also stuff to watch out for. The sleep spray has tryptophan so you can't use it with serotonin meds like Cymbalta. I found that one out the hard way and another trip to the ER. I gave up the Cymbalta for other reasons and kept on using the sleep spray.

I'd also recommend getting a quality sleep tracking watch. There's been so many times where I thought I didn't sleep but I did, it just was light sleep. That helped me mentally prep for the day and convince myself that I slept, even if it wasn't well. 

Again, this isn't medical advice. I'm sharing this info because there were many many time where I made peace with what I felt like was gonna be death from lack of sleep. 

I know what that sadness feels like. If you can find relief like I did and not have to take dangerous meds anymore, maybe it's worth it.

&lt;p&gt;Again, this isn&amp;#39;t medical advice. I&amp;#39;m sharing this info because there were many many time where I made peace with what I felt like was gonna be death from lack of sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what that sadness feels like. If you can find relief like I did and not have to take dangerous meds anymore, maybe it&amp;#39;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do you, this isn&amp;#39;t medical advice or sponsored. Just a personal story of what saved my life, literally. &lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,"
About two years ago, I had a bout of insomnia (random) that made it almost impossible to sleep. I convinced myself it was sporadic fatal insomnia, and did the rumination and Googling thing. Eventually, after multiple doctor visits, it went away and I slept normally. My doctor had given me Lexapro to try, and it helped but this time—things are a little different.

Since May 2024, I kept having these intense panic attacks in the car (always the car). It happened probably 5-6 times between May and September of this year. However, I had one of these attacks in bed while playing a mobile game. I went to the ER that night, and everything turned out fine, and despite how jarred I was I still went home and slept that night. 

However, fast forward to a couple of nights ago and now I’m experiencing the same insomnia I experienced two years ago. I’ll be fine throughout the day, tired, but getting my shit done. As night approaches, I notice I get more anxious now and have a swell of other symptoms. I’ll lay in bed and feel more on edge. I’ll then start feeling flushed, and my sensitivity to hot and cold gets sooooo bad. I’ll become restless, and then when I close my eyes I’ll “hear” things or have these nonsensical thoughts that make it so hard to go to sleep. I’ve managed an hour or three of sleep, here and there, but then will be up again…feeling flushed, agitated and on edge alongside a bunch of twitching everywhere.

It’s just gotten worse. I’m on day four, and only slept 2 hours, lightly, and have been up since 1:30am this morning. I hurt everywhere. My eyes feel like lead. I’m at my wits end and trying very hard to not google and catastrophize about ailments that I know aren’t the cause of my insomnia.

,insomnia,"Hi guys,

So im in a terrible point in my life. Before attempting to quit coffee i used to sleep about 7.5-8.5 hours almost every day. Had a bad night every once in a while, but who doesnt? I used to drink about 3-5 cups a day.

But in June i tried to quit coffee to see how it would benefit my life. I quit cold turkey (mistake) and the first week was fine, just headaches and feeling tired but sleeping well. At about day 10 i started getting really bad insomnia, about 3-6 hours of sleep per night.

I tried to get through it because at first i didnt realize it was quitting coffee that caused it, but after almost a month i couldnt do it any longer and started drinking coffee again, albeit less coffee (1-2 cups a day and only in the morning)

Its been about 3 months since i started drinking coffee again and my sleep isnt really getting better. I almost always wake up at the 4-5 hour mark and sometimes i can go back to sleep for another hour or two and most of the times i cannot. Im lucky if i get 6.5 hours of sleep in a night

Ive tried everything i can think of. Magnesium bigycinate/mag l-threonate. Shutting off all screens 1-2 hours before bed. I always get atleast 20-30 mins of sunlight first thing in the morning when i go for a walk. I lift weights 3x a week (althought its been getting harder to do so) I have a pretty solid diet of meat, fish, rice, veggies, potatoes and eggs. And i also go to bed at the same time every day. Falling asleep at night isnt a problem, usually fall asleep within 20 mins but waking up in the middle of the night and then going back to sleep is my main issue.

I tried sleeping pills but i took it for two days and got really bad tinnitus (which honestly just made my sleep worse, maybe even permanently?)

Edit: I also used to smoke a lot of weed, but i tried quitting weed after about 2 months of this insomnia and it seemed to get slightly better? Im not 100% sure though, but it didnt get worse.

,insomnia,"Hello, insomniacs of Reddit. I wanted to share my story and see if anyone else is going through the same thing, and if they have any advice or solutions that could help me.

My sleeping issues have been happening for as long as I can remember. They stemmed from childhood when I would force myself to stay awake every night and avoid naps because I always felt like I’d be missing out on something. Even as an infant, I wouldn’t nap (which annoyed everyone around me, lol), and it’s only gotten worse over time. In preschool, I couldn’t nap like the other kids, and it would take me an hour to fall asleep after my parents put me to bed. By elementary school, my bedtime was around 8 or 9 p.m., but I’d lie awake until midnight or 1 a.m., only to get up for school the next day.

Things got significantly worse when I started middle school. I became addicted to video games and got a cellphone. Most nights, I’d be up until 2 or 3 a.m. playing. My family decided to give me melatonin, and for a while, it worked. I took 1mg each night, and for a couple of months, it knocked me out, and I slept great. However, I’d still play video games nonstop until the melatonin kicked in, usually around 10:30 or 11 p.m. Eventually, the 1mg dose stopped working, so I upped it to 2mg, and so on. By mid-to-late high school, I was taking 10mg but staying up until 2 or 3 a.m. because I HAD to play video games, then waking up at 6 a.m. for school. Going to school exhausted wasn’t fun, but I couldn’t sleep without melatonin, and taking it too early made it less effective, so I’d be awake anyway.

Then college came, and things really fell apart. I didn’t have to wake up early every day, and my classes were later in the day, but I still took 10mg of melatonin. I also started drinking, as many college students do, which made my sleep schedule even more erratic. Alcohol makes me tired but keeps me awake and worsens my insomnia. Eventually, melatonin stopped working entirely. I tried 10mg, 20mg, and even went up to 30mg sometimes.

In an effort to fix my sleep, I tried alternatives: turning off electronics by 10 p.m., reading a book, using cannabis (which worked for about two weeks but then gave me terrible anxiety and had the opposite effect, keeping me awake longer), warm showers, establishing a consistent routine for weeks, cutting out alcohol, magnesium, ashwagandha, working out earlier in the day, cutting out caffeine, getting 15,000 steps a day, and trying to reduce stress from school (which is nearly impossible). I’ve probably tried more things that I can’t think of right now.

These days, I sleep about 2-4 hours a night, with the occasional 7-8 hour stretch if I didn’t sleep at all the night before. Even then, I sometimes only manage 4-5 hours. I’m in my final year of college now and keep telling myself I’ll fix this after I graduate and can establish a better routine. My friends and family know I have a problem, but they don’t really understand the extent of my sleep issues or how little sleep I actually get. They just think I’m lazy and shy, which I’m not at all — I’m just so exhausted all the time.

Currently it’s 7am and I’ve been up since 5am the previous day, not being able to sleep. I can’t remember the last time I got over 8 hours of sleep in a night. 

I’m considering getting a sleep study done next month and maybe starting some medication, but after reading similar posts on Reddit, I’m not confident it will be a fix-all solution. I wanted to share my story here and see if anyone has advice or experiences they could share, and if I should get the sleep study done sooner rather than later. Thanks for reading.

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to fix my sleep, I tried alternatives: turning off electronics by 10 p.m., reading a book, using cannabis (which worked for about two weeks but then gave me terrible anxiety and had the opposite effect, keeping me awake longer), warm showers, establishing a consistent routine for weeks, cutting out alcohol, magnesium, ashwagandha, working out earlier in the day, cutting out caffeine, getting 15,000 steps a day, and trying to reduce stress from school (which is nearly impossible). I’ve probably tried more things that I can’t think of right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, I sleep about 2-4 hours a night, with the occasional 7-8 hour stretch if I didn’t sleep at all the night before. Even then, I sometimes only manage 4-5 hours. I’m in my final year of college now and keep telling myself I’ll fix this after I graduate and can establish a better routine. My friends and family know I have a problem, but they don’t really understand the extent of my sleep issues or how little sleep I actually get. They just think I’m lazy and shy, which I’m not at all — I’m just so exhausted all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently it’s 7am and I’ve been up since 5am the previous day, not being able to sleep. I can’t remember the last time I got over 8 hours of sleep in a night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m considering getting a sleep study done next month and maybe starting some medication, but after reading similar posts on Reddit, I’m not confident it will be a fix-all solution. I wanted to share my story here and see if anyone has advice or experiences they could share, and if I should get the sleep study done sooner rather than later. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,"So sorry if this has been posted a billion times before, but making sure you're not too cold when you sleep helps! From personal experience, feeling heat flushes in your body might actually be a sign that you're too cold rather than too hot. 

I just joined this sub so not sure what usually goes down here, but this has been really helping me so I thought I might make a post.

Im not sure what kind of insomnia I experience. Definitely due to uni stress and stress induced bedtime procrastination, probs a bit of depression sprinkled on there.

This has been a problem that's been plaguing me for a few years; I've been considering diagnosis but always held back cause I'm broke.

Recently even though I'd been forcing myself to wake up earlier it hadnt, as I'd hoped, resulted in me feeling sleepier earlier. So I'd just run on another 4 hours of sleep for a day or two, crash, then rinse and repeat. 

Recently I've figured out... It's because I'm too cold when I try to sleep. Not because I didn't have enough blankets but cause I wasn't wearing enough pajamas (usually just a t shirt or smth); something about clothing being closer to your skin helps retain the heat a lot better. Did that cause I read wearing less when you sleep helps you sleep better actually. Clearly didn't work for me. 

I didn't figure this out until recently because I didn't FEEL cold. I think it's because my body was 'overcompensating'?? By producing a lot of heat?? So it always felt like I was feverish and hot and anxious and buzzing. 

But anyways I have since started wearing full set pajamas again (long sleeved long pants, t shirt and pajama pants as the need arises) and it's gotten a LOT better.

Also, for the last 3 nights, I've begun sleeping almost the double amount of time I used to (which makes it \~6 h) and stopped being awake too long at night. I would never sleep on two consecutive nights for such a long time before. So it seems SRT is starting to work for me, to an extent:

The worrying thing is I'm still as tired as before (often even more: yesterday was awful, and I don't work out anymore).

,insomnia,"Hi everyone,
About six days ago, I started having trouble sleeping. I visited a psychiatrist for unrelated reasons, and he prescribed Rxulti. At first, I was getting 4-5 hours a night, though it was rough. But on Monday, I took the medication late (around 7 PM), and since then, I’ve maybe slept a total of 1.5 hours. Last night, I didn’t sleep at all.

I stopped taking Rxulti on Tuesday, but the sleeplessness hasn’t improved. Correlation doesn’t equal causation and I don't think the medication is to blame.

I’m naturally anxious and high in neuroticism, but the sleeplessness. Despite that, when i try tò sleep i manage tò think about other stuff. Usually, before I fall asleep, my mind drifts through free associations and non-logical thoughts until I eventually doze off. Now,  the first part still occurs. However It feels like my brain has forgotten how to take that last step into sleep.

I’m really scared—especially about the short-term effects. I worry about my brain not shutting down under anesthesia. Yesterday, I felt tired but otherwise fine. I wonder if today I will start hallucinating.

Should I go to a neurologist? I also see a psychoanalyst, but I’m not sure how helpful that will be for something like this.

Any advice or thoughts would be really appreciated.

,insomnia,"Hello, I’ve never posted on here before but I recently for the first time had a bout of insomnia wherein for a 2-3 week period, honestly it’s a bit cloudy, I didn’t sleep at all. Now I imagine that I probably did get SOME brief moments of sleep in between moments of tossing and turning in the night but I know there were genuinely nights where I did actually get 0 sleep.

I was adamant that I wouldn’t take any sleeping pills and would fix it on my own but I went a bit over the top with trying to control it and this is probably the issue why it went on for so long, thanks to a post I think I read on here it taught me that the key to fixing this is to lay off a bit and not try and control and get everything perfect. I let my sleep naturally happen rather than making it a big operation every night, I took promethazine for a few nights and with the tools I learned I managed to sleep fine without it.

Now thankfully for a few nights I’ve been sleeping great, go to bed at around 9 and I wake up about 5/6, a bit earlier than what it used to be but this is when my bodies getting me out of bed and I’m sleeping through the night so I’m not complaining!

Felt pretty euphoric the first two days I was getting sleep again and then I kind of normalised but now I feel really odd. I noticed when I woke up yesterday I felt a bit more short sighted than normal, granted I did use my phone and devices a lot more than usual the day before and as I’ve been “laying off” as I previously mentioned I’ve been allowing more screen time. Then I almost had a panic attack twice out in public because I felt weird, I felt that things didn’t feel real, I was fading almost. I have had things like this happen before, it’s never happened in public but at home plenty of times I’ve had these “panic attacks” and when I got home I’ve felt in a really weird delirious state. When I went to bed last night I felt like when I went to bed I wasn’t going to wake up I felt really scared, I am an anxious person so this isn’t something completely new to me I’ve had moments in the past where I’ve thought I’m having heart attack etc but I felt really weird and my consciousness just doesn’t seem as prominent as before if that makes sense? Like just don’t feel with it. I might of just been really tired and making up for the lost sleep. I woke up this morning and I’ve been having this weird delirium all day wherein things keep feeling different, I don’t feel with it and things just don’t feel all there.

Now my issue is I don’t know whether I should be concerned about this. As I mentioned I’m an anxious person and I’ve bigged up many scenarios in my mind in the past. Is this poor cognitive state normal for people who have just suffered pretty severe insomnia? Or is this really something I actually should be concerned about?

I’ve already spent enough time in hospitals and I know if I go down that route it’ll be a big disruption to my sleep again so I’m not sure whether this needs attention or whether it’d be better to focus on my rest and recovery and just accept there’s gonna be symptoms as my body recovers.

My anxiety tells me there’s a chance my sleep insomnia was caused by a health issue that these symptoms are related to. I just don’t know when to listen to my anxiety and when not to because it’s hard to know when it’s justified.

Does this sound normal to you guys ?

Oh and also thank you for posting such great stuff really helped me when I had no hope when I managed to sleep again it felt like a true miracle. The book “say goodnight to insomnia” also helped if anyone is after any recommendations ",[],False,,0,False,Are these post insomnia symptoms normal?,[],r/insomnia,False,,,0,,False,t3_1fq1fmz,False,dark,1.0,,public,4,0,{},,False,,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,,1727370973.0,,{},,True,,1727370762.0,text,,,,self.insomnia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I’ve never posted on here before but I recently for the first time had a bout of insomnia wherein for a 2-3 week period, honestly it’s a bit cloudy, I didn’t sleep at all. Now I imagine that I probably did get SOME brief moments of sleep in between moments of tossing and turning in the night but I know there were genuinely nights where I did actually get 0 sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was adamant that I wouldn’t take any sleeping pills and would fix it on my own but I went a bit over the top with trying to control it and this is probably the issue why it went on for so long, thanks to a post I think I read on here it taught me that the key to fixing this is to lay off a bit and not try and control and get everything perfect. I let my sleep naturally happen rather than making it a big operation every night, I took promethazine for a few nights and with the tools I learned I managed to sleep fine without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now thankfully for a few nights I’ve been sleeping great, go to bed at around 9 and I wake up about 5/6, a bit earlier than what it used to be but this is when my bodies getting me out of bed and I’m sleeping through the night so I’m not complaining!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felt pretty euphoric the first two days I was getting sleep again and then I kind of normalised but now I feel really odd. I noticed when I woke up yesterday I felt a bit more short sighted than normal, granted I did use my phone and devices a lot more than usual the day before and as I’ve been “laying off” as I previously mentioned I’ve been allowing more screen time. Then I almost had a panic attack twice out in public because I felt weird, I felt that things didn’t feel real, I was fading almost. I have had things like this happen before, it’s never happened in public but at home plenty of times I’ve had these “panic attacks” and when I got home I’ve felt in a really weird delirious state. When I went to bed last night I felt like when I went to bed I wasn’t going to wake up I felt really scared, I am an anxious person so this isn’t something completely new to me I’ve had moments in the past where I’ve thought I’m having heart attack etc but I felt really weird and my consciousness just doesn’t seem as prominent as before if that makes sense? Like just don’t feel with it. I might of just been really tired and making up for the lost sleep. I woke up this morning and I’ve been having this weird delirium all day wherein things keep feeling different, I don’t feel with it and things just don’t feel all there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my issue is I don’t know whether I should be concerned about this. As I mentioned I’m an anxious person and I’ve bigged up many scenarios in my mind in the past. Is this poor cognitive state normal for people who have just suffered pretty severe insomnia? Or is this really something I actually should be concerned about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already spent enough time in hospitals and I know if I go down that route it’ll be a big disruption to my sleep again so I’m not sure whether this needs attention or whether it’d be better to focus on my rest and recovery and just accept there’s gonna be symptoms as my body recovers.&lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia," Last year, I (male,32) had a single room due to my insomnia, which I’m still receiving treatment for. This year, due to what was initially referred to a shortage of single rooms, I’ve been assigned a roommate (Male,20), although I’ve been making an appeal ever since. This follow-up to this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1evcz5j/when\_and\_how\_should\_i\_address\_my\_insomnia\_with\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1evcz5j/when_and_how_should_i_address_my_insomnia_with_my/) I decided not to make my request to not have late-night guests over.

· Background: The university is located in a small town that is unfamiliar to many students. This year, the head of the school made a last-minute decision to increase the student intake significantly due to financial needs and reduced government subsidies. This has placed considerable pressure on the housing department to find off-campus accommodation. However, all single rooms are on-campus and are allocated through a lottery system for university seniors, with exceptions made only if the Special Needs Office (SNO) recommends accommodations based on medical conditions.

· Initial Appeal: When I appealed to the housing department weeks ago for a double room, I was informed that all single rooms were full. However, they had not yet been occupied, as the school had not opened. The department stated that the system indicates full occupancy by final year students. I inquired why my previous accommodation in a single room, based on my medical report, was not being honored this year. They explained that they prioritize final year students over medical issues.

· Consultation with Housing Manager: I subsequently appealed to the housing manager, who advised me to consult the SNO while they continue to assist students living in overcrowded conditions off-campus.

· SNO Involvement: The SNO expressed confusion about the timing of their involvement, noting that they had not been informed of my condition despite being a student since last year. After several weeks of effort, they informed me that the housing department keeps deferring my case, citing their focus on overcrowded students. I asked if I should return to the manager for an update since he had referred me to the SNO. The SNO staff supported this approach, emphasizing the need to explore how the manager’s department can assist, given the SNO's repeated rejections from his office.

· Follow-Up with the Manager: When I attempted to see the manager last week, he requested that I return this week.

· Current Situation: During my visit this week, the manager stated that the school is prioritizing more urgent issues regarding students living in overcrowded on-campus housing. When I reminded him that many students have been assigned single rooms, sometimes by Resident Assistants rather than through the lottery, annoyed, he instructed me to identify those rooms (I am aware of three) and return to him adding that these rooms would be allocated to students with more pressing needs, as my request “is not a priority”. He suggested that I should be grateful for my current accommodation with Wi-Fi, rather than insisting on the resolution of my single room request. He also mentioned I need to be more sensitive towards the issues affecting overcrowded students, despite the fact that my situation is unrelated, as no single room has more than one occupant.

· SNO Follow-Up: Upon returning to the SNO, I learned that the manager had contacted them prior to that tempestuous meeting, seeking advice on how to handle my case. They recommended that he assist me in securing a single room and expressed their disagreement with his assertion that my issue is not a housing priority.

· Medical Documentation: My last medical report is from last year so I never updated it as I didn’t think the school will not consider my situation this year. I have requested a medical report update from my sleep specialist, which will be available next Thursday following my consultation. I plan to present this report for my appeal to the manager's superior same day. At this time, I prefer not to identify those unfairly allocated rooms the manager asked me to get back to him with, as I do not trust that he will handle the matter fairly; however, I will bring this information to his superiors.

,insomnia,"Hi everyone. I'm writing this partly to vent and partly to ask for advice.

I've always been a good sleeper. I usually went to bed at 11:30 pm and woke up around 7:00 am. Falling asleep wasn't a problem for me.

A few years ago, I went through a period of nighttime awakenings that caused me a lot of sleep anxiety and led me to see a sleep specialist and a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist prescribed lorazepam for when I couldn't sleep, and I gradually stopped taking it and replaced it with melatonin. The sleep doctor told me that it's not considered chronic insomnia if you can sleep 4 hours a night (which I could, often sleeping 5 or 6 hours but in fragmented periods). Over time, I stopped taking the pill, they put me on an SSRI, and the awakenings decreased, and when they did happen, I would take one or two drops of melatonin (equivalent to 0.5mg) and continue sleeping. Eventually, I was able to sleep through the night without melatonin or anything else.

Now my insomnia has returned, sometimes at the beginning of sleep, sometimes with nighttime awakenings, and with it, anxiety. The psychiatrist has prescribed Lormetazepam. It works great, I sleep for 7 hours straight, but I know it's not the solution. I've tried EMDR to get rid of the anxiety about not sleeping, and while I don't get nervous about not sleeping, I don't sleep more than 5 hours (without the pill). I've tried blue-light blocking glasses, magnesium bisglycinate, etc.

The question that really worries me is the impact this could have on my health. I'm 41 years old and have a 4-year-old daughter. I don't have high blood pressure or cholesterol, and I exercise 3 times a week. Can you have a healthy life sleeping so little? If, in the worst-case scenario, my internal clock has broken, could I live like this for 10 or 15 years? That's what really scares me about this situation.

So WHATS THE PROBLEM?

Im a 21F told I have ‘a bit of’ insomnia blamed on period cycle by a doctor. Don’t get period anymore but doctors won’t listen. Chronic day sleeper even with satisfying sleep. Usually I fall asleep at 3am but I’m in bed at 12:30am. If I get up before 10:30am by the afternoon I feel sick to my stomach and like I’ll fall asleep at any moment. I have low iron but supplements/treatments don’t make a noticeable difference. It feels impossible to resist my mid day nap it’s like I literally can’t stay awake.

I know it makes sense to say I’m just napping in the day cuz I don’t sleep at night but I know my body and it’s not that! It happens no matter how much REM sleep I get at night but doctors don’t listen :(

,insomnia,"Writing this in case anyone is up in the middle of the night searching this sub like I used to. About a year and a half ago, I (29F) started on hormonal birth control that completely messed up my entire system. I’d never been successful using hormonal BC before (previously I’d been using non hormonal for almost 7 years) and was only on it for about three months before stopping this time. Unfortunately, that was enough to throw my sleep off for the following year.

During this time I was regularly going up to 72 hours without sleeping. My doctor prescribed me a few different sleeping pills but my body always fought them off. I tried every sleeping hack on the internet and I’ve finally landed on a routine that allows me to sleep through the night regularly. 

Current routine:
- Eating some protein before bed: anecdotally, I think this allows the supplements to be broken down more slowly. 
- Valerian root: I use a tincture that has a few different herbs including the valerian root and passionflower. I put this in a small cup of tea before bed. 
- Iron: supplement pill at 65 mg. Used to combat restless legs from anxiety about being awake.
- Magnesium: supplement pill at 500 mg. Everyone says magnesium glycinate is the best, but I’ve been using regular magnesium (because I bought the wrong one) and I think it still works fine.
- CBD and mushrooms: I take a combo gummy of 50 mg CBD with chaga, lions mane, and reishi mushrooms. This made the biggest immediate difference for me. I’d been taking regular CBD before but the mushrooms really helped.

Things I do not incorporate into my routine anymore:
- tart cherry juice: might be controversial but this never worked for me. It made me have pee multiple times a night and would just wake me up to do that.
- spoon full of peanut butter: I saw this a lot on tik tok and tried it for a few months. I think it’s similar to eating protein before bed but I didn’t notice a difference after I stopped doing it.
- melatonin: made me so sick and I would wake up shaking after a few hours. 

Going the herbal route is not going to work for everyone but it has made such a difference for me as I heal my sleep cycle. Last night I didn’t do half the routine (only took the cbd) and was up half the night. The previous few nights when I’d done the routine in full I slept the full night uninterrupted.

I cannot function if I don’t get at least nine hours of sleep—I get very nauseous and other bad GI stuff, confused, dizzy, and headaches. If that happens a few days in a row my body basically shuts down. I start a new job in a few weeks that will require waking up around 6am and I’m very nervous. I have been trying to shift my sleep schedule back with no luck. Right now I’m getting into bed at 10pm and waking up at 8 am, very exhausted (I’d say it takes at least an hour for me to fall sleep).

The Trazodone and Mirtazipine made me feel very sleep but didn’t make me fall asleep. The Mirtazipine also caused severe next-day brain fog and anger. I had a sleep study and do not have sleep apnea. I also use a light box in the morning. I am not anxious or having any racing thoughts before I sleep, the issue seems to be that my body just physically will not fall asleep. My psychiatrist has been very hesitant to try Ambien because she is worried about long term dependence and side effects, but she is willing to have that be the next step.

,insomnia,"This started happening completely out of the blue about two weeks ago. One day I was sleeping like a baby and the next I went the WHOLE NIGHT with 0 hours of sleep. I just lay awake but with my eyes closed. I got up in the morning really frustrated, exhausted, and upset and had some fruit to eat before going back to bed. I wasn’t expecting to sleep, I just thought I’d lie down in bed but I wound up falling asleep anyway for about 4 hours. When I went to bed that night , I got about 10 hours of sleep and slept till about midday . 

The next few nights I was falling asleep except it was taking me 2-3 hours to actually drift off. This is very unlike me. Usually I drift off within about 5 minutes and struggle to keep myself awake. But now suddenly it takes me hours to fall asleep?? I was taking melatonin during this time as well, but that didn’t seem to be helping at all. Then it randomly went away for about 2 days, I got magnesium spray and started spraying it on my feet and that seemed to be working, I was out like a light within 5-20 minutes. But then it came back and I couldn’t fall asleep until 5:30 in the morning, and then the next night I didn’t sleep a wink. Now last night I sprayed magnesium on myself, took a dosage of sleeping supplements (Blackmore fall asleep tablets), and went to bed. I was drowsy, sure but no sleep! I started feeling very sick and anxious. Didn’t sleep until 6am and then woke up at 9:30am, tossed and turned for 2 more hours until I finally said fuck it and now I’m up. 

I’m really afraid. I’m going to Europe in two weeks and what if this ruins the trip?? I don’t know if I should go to the doctor because I don’t know if I’ll be taken seriously as an 18 year old. They might just tell me it’s my phone but it feels as if there is a deeper issue going on here. I’m not particularly anxious about anything going on in my life, there are no stressors. I’m on a gap year, I’m the most relaxed I’ve ever been so I don’t know why this has started happening to me. 

I have struggled with mental illnesses in the past but not anymore - I had anorexia from 15-17 but I’m recovered. I had depression during that time as well and struggled with pretty severe self harm and suicidal thoughts so I’m afraid that this issue will spiral into some unhealthy coping mechanisms. I just want a break. My brain has not been kind to me my teenage years, and I’ve been SO happy and calm this year after finishing high school, the fact that this is now happening to me is genuinely the worst form of torture.

I had depression during that time as well and struggled with pretty severe self harm and suicidal thoughts so I’m afraid that this issue will spiral into some unhealthy coping mechanisms. I just want a break. My brain has not been kind to me my teenage years, and I’ve been SO happy and calm this year after finishing high school, the fact that this is now happening to me is genuinely the worst form of torture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any tips please let me know. I’m from Melbourne Australia so if there are any other aussies here who know of good supplements / remedies that can be easily bought it’d be much appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

,insomnia,"First time here, as I'm usually a pretty good sleeper. But am really freaked out and could use guidance from this community. 

A month ago, I slept fine. Then I got an alarming medical test result back and that sent me spiraling with anxiety and worry, keeping me up all night at times and putting me in a shitty sleeping pattern, being afraid of bedtime every night because I NEED to sleep NOW and cannot go through another day as a zombie. Things did get a bit better, then a family member went into crisis and it started up again. That's where we are now. 

My doc prescribed 50mg Trazodone, said I can take one or two, but that hangover headache the next day is unbearable...if that's where it's coming from. Also prescribed .5-1mg of Ativan. Sometimes it helps, sometimes my anxiety just powers right through it. 

  
I've now associated bedtime and my bed with an anxiety response and I hate it. The clock is ticking 12, 1, 2, 3, 4....my wife is sound asleep and I'm still up, so tired, desperate to just fall the f asleep. I do guided meditations, white noise apps, no caffeine after noon, etc etc. Even tried telling myself that ""just resting is important"" but I still lay there and tense up, and I already had TMJ issues in the past that I'm paranoid about flaring up again. 

Every night is just a gamble and I can't find a definitive thing that works. Sleep has always caused me some anxiety bc it's crucial and you can't just go DO it, like eating....it feels like out of my control and the ""anxiety demon"" is just torturing me now. I know I have the ability to sleep, I've done it most nights of my life, but it feels like I forgot and I need to break out of this cycle.  

Not sure where to turn but feels like I could use some reassurance or advice from people who've been through this. Thank you!

,insomnia,"Hi everyone,

I'm new to this subreddit, and although I wish I didn't have to be here, I need some advice regarding my sleep issues. To keep things concise and easy to read, I’ll provide information on my background, current sleeping conditions, and future goals in bullet points.

**1.0 - Background Information:**

**1.1 - Sleeping Problems**

I've been having sleep problems since the beginning of high school, approximately, without any specific reasons I can pinpoint among the numerous interplay of variables. These problems can be described as difficulties in:

* **A) Falling Asleep**
* **B) Waking Up / Getting Out of Bed**

I'm now in my 30s, and over the years, I believe the situation has worsened not having to forcefully get out of bed due to personal flexibility when it comes to my schedules.

**1.2 - Night Owl Tendency**

Since I can remember, I've never been a morning person. My brain and body are more active late in the day or even at night. This is when I feel most energetic (physically) and productive (mentally), whether it's about learning, working, deciding, exercising, organizing, and so on. Essentially, the morning and the night versions of me are two different people. The morning version of me is slow, demotivated, and resistant to doing things - almost paralyzed and dull - versus the night me, who is more active and ready to take on tasks. This condition persists today, no matter where I am, how much I sleep, or what I do with my life.

**2.0 - Current Situation:**

**2.1 - Sleep Sensitivities / Preferences**

* **2.1.1 - Ventilation Needed**: I prefer sleeping with the window open for fresh air. I feel I might not breathe effectively at night and tend to sleep with my mouth open, even though I don't have asthma or nasal issues.
* **2.1.2 - Noise Sensitivity**: Even minimal sounds like the refrigerator humming can disturb me. I've tried earplugs, but prolonged use feels uncomfortable and causes soreness or inflammation in my ear canal.
* **2.1.3 - Mosquitoes**: I often get bitten by mosquitoes since I sleep with the window open. While repellents help, I sometimes run out, and their presence delays my sleep until 3-4 AM. This isn't a major problem but certainly doesn't help with my difficulty falling asleep, especially during warmer seasons.
* **2.1.4 - Light Sensitivity**: Surprisingly, **I'm not very sensitive** to light, especially in the morning when I feel my body wants to sleep the most. Sometimes I leave my computer's screensaver running for a few hours while I'm in bed, and it doesn't seem to affect me (although I don't have 100% proof of this). I believe light doesn’t impact me since I can sleep for hours even with the blinds open during the daytime.

**2.2 - Problem Description**

* **2.2.1 - Difficulty Falling Asleep**: Even though I force myself to go to bed at a certain time, I never have the feeling of wanting to sleep or being really tired like I am in the morning. Even if I go to bed at a reasonable time, I experience:
   * Restlessness in bed.
   * An active brain that won't shut down.
   * Palpitations and anxiety at times, also fueled by the fact of not falling asleep.
   * Feeling of warmth, which makes me remove my blankets (perhaps connected to anxiety).
   * A sense of needing fresh air, which sometimes makes it difficult for me to fall asleep (though this isn't as severe as sleep apnea).
* **2.2.2 - Difficulty Waking Up/Getting Out of Bed**: Although waking up and getting out of bed are two different things, I struggle with both. It's difficult to get out of bed because I don't feel awake, as described below:
   * **Grogginess and Tiredness**: I can't recall a day in my life when I woke up feeling rested and restored, except on rare occasions. Even if I force myself out of bed, I feel sluggish and mentally foggy for hours afterward.
   * **Delayed Alertness**: It generally takes about **3 hours** after I get out of bed for my brain and body to start functioning normally. For example, if I wake up at 8:00 AM, I don't feel fully awake until around 11:00 AM. Similarly, if I wake up at 1:00 PM, I feel more awake around 4:00 PM. The 3-hour mark is just an **empirical observation** and is subject to variables, but the general concept is that no matter how much I sleep or what time I go to bed or wake up, I always need a few hours before I can engage effectively in life.

Closing this section, it's needless to say that there are days when the situation is better or worse. Clearly, if I've slept just a couple of hours, I feel terrible versus nights when I've slept more.

**3.0 - What I've Tried:**

I've tried many things to fall asleep and regulate my sleep patterns, but nothing seems to have worked consistently. I've tried:

* **Melatonin**: 2 mg, 1 hour before going to bed.
* **Valerian Root**: 500 mg, 1 hour before going to bed.
* **App Blocks** on all of my digital devices to prevent internet usage after a certain hour.
* **Blue Light Blockers** on all of my devices.
* **Alarm Clocks** to remind me to go to sleep.
* **Forcing Myself Into Bed** and shutting everything off.

Unfortunately, none of these seem to have worked consistently. If I sometimes manage to fall asleep at a more reasonable time, it's due to other circumstances that aren't easily identified.

**What works** sometimes instead is:

* **Alcohol**: If I drink too much, it's much easier to fall asleep, especially when feeling drunk.
* **CBD or THC** (legal where I live): These can knock me out, making it easier to sleep.

However, as you might imagine, both of the above options aren't suitable in the long term, and while they allow me to fall asleep more easily, they sometimes have the opposite effect in the morning with potential hangovers.

**4.0 - My Current Goal:**

My goal is quite simple: to get at least **7-8 hours of normal sleep** and **feel refreshed and mentally active** as soon as I start the day, allowing me to live a normal life like most other people.

**5.0 - Sleep Tracking Screenshots:**

I'm attaching several screenshots of my **Fitbit/Google Fit** tracking my current sleep activity. I'm sharing different screenshots taken from various days. As you can see, there's a general pattern of falling asleep very late and staying in bed until late or spending a lot of time in bed restlessly.

**Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Has anyone experienced something similar? What strategies or treatments have helped you?**

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m new to this subreddit, and although I wish I didn&amp;#39;t have to be here, I need some advice regarding my sleep issues. To keep things concise and easy to read, I’ll provide information on my background, current sleeping conditions, and future goals in bullet points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.0 - Background Information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1 - Sleeping Problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been having sleep problems since the beginning of high school, approximately, without any specific reasons I can pinpoint among the numerous interplay of variables. These problems can be described as difficulties in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A) Falling Asleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B) Waking Up / Getting Out of Bed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now in my 30s, and over the years, I believe the situation has worsened not having to forcefully get out of bed due to personal flexibility when it comes to my schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.2 - Night Owl Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I can remember, I&amp;#39;ve never been a morning person. My brain and body are more active late in the day or even at night. This is when I feel most energetic (physically) and productive (mentally), whether it&amp;#39;s about learning, working, deciding, exercising, organizing, and so on. Essentially, the morning and the night versions of me are two different people. The morning version of me is slow, demotivated, and resistant to doing things - almost paralyzed and dull - versus the night me, who is more active and ready to take on tasks. This condition persists today, no matter where I am, how much I sleep, or what I do with my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.0 - Current Situation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1 - Sleep Sensitivities / Preferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1.1 - Ventilation Needed&lt;/strong&gt;: I prefer sleeping with the window open for fresh air. I feel I might not breathe effectively at night and tend to sleep with my mouth open, even though I don&amp;#39;t have asthma or nasal issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1.2 - Noise Sensitivity&lt;/strong&gt;: Even minimal sounds like the refrigerator humming can disturb me. I&amp;#39;ve tried earplugs, but prolonged use feels uncomfortable and causes soreness or inflammation in my ear canal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1.3 - Mosquitoes&lt;/strong&gt;: I often get bitten by mosquitoes since I sleep with the window open. While repellents help, I sometimes run out, and their presence delays my sleep until 3-4 AM. This isn&amp;#39;t a major problem but certainly doesn&amp;#39;t help with my difficulty falling asleep, especially during warmer seasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1.4 - Light Sensitivity&lt;/strong&gt;: Surprisingly, &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m not very sensitive&lt;/strong&gt; to light, especially in the morning when I feel my body wants to sleep the most. Sometimes I leave my computer&amp;#39;s screensaver running for a few hours while I&amp;#39;m in bed, and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to affect me (although I don&amp;#39;t have 100% proof of this). I believe light doesn’t impact me since I can sleep for hours even with the blinds open during the daytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2 - Problem Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2.1 - Difficulty Falling Asleep&lt;/strong&gt;: Even though I force myself to go to bed at a certain time, I never have the feeling of wanting to sleep or being really tired like I am in the morning. Even if I go to bed at a reasonable time, I experience:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restlessness in bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An active brain that won&amp;#39;t shut down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palpitations and anxiety at times, also fueled by the fact of not falling asleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling of warmth, which makes me remove my blankets (perhaps connected to anxiety).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sense of needing fresh air, which sometimes makes it difficult for me to fall asleep (though this isn&amp;#39;t as severe as sleep apnea).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2.2 - Difficulty Waking Up/Getting Out of Bed&lt;/strong&gt;: Although waking up and getting out of bed are two different things, I struggle with both. It&amp;#39;s difficult to get out of bed because I don&amp;#39;t feel awake, as described below:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grogginess and Tiredness&lt;/strong&gt;: I can&amp;#39;t recall a day in my life when I woke up feeling rested and restored, except on rare occasions. Even if I force myself out of bed, I feel sluggish and mentally foggy for hours afterward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delayed Alertness&lt;/strong&gt;: It generally takes about &lt;strong&gt;3 hours&lt;/strong&gt; after I get out of bed for my brain and body to start functioning normally. For example, if I wake up at 8:00 AM, I don&amp;#39;t feel fully awake until around 11:00 AM. Similarly, if I wake up at 1:00 PM, I feel more awake around 4:00 PM. The 3-hour mark is just an &lt;strong&gt;empirical observation&lt;/strong&gt; and is subject to variables, but the general concept is that no matter how much I sleep or what time I go to bed or wake up, I always need a few hours before I can engage effectively in life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing this section, it&amp;#39;s needless to say that there are days when the situation is better or worse. Clearly, if I&amp;#39;ve slept just a couple of hours, I feel terrible versus nights when I&amp;#39;ve slept more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.0 - What I&amp;#39;ve Tried:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried many things to fall asleep and regulate my sleep patterns, but nothing seems to have worked consistently. I&amp;#39;ve tried:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melatonin&lt;/strong&gt;: 2 mg, 1 hour before going to bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valerian Root&lt;/strong&gt;: 500 mg, 1 hour before going to bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Blocks&lt;/strong&gt; on all of my digital devices to prevent internet usage after a certain hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Light Blockers&lt;/strong&gt; on all of my devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alarm Clocks&lt;/strong&gt; to remind me to go to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forcing Myself Into Bed&lt;/strong&gt; and shutting everything off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, none of these seem to have worked consistently. If I sometimes manage to fall asleep at a more reasonable time, it&amp;#39;s due to other circumstances that aren&amp;#39;t easily identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What works&lt;/strong&gt; sometimes instead is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;: If I drink too much, it&amp;#39;s much easier to fall asleep, especially when feeling drunk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBD or THC&lt;/strong&gt; (legal where I live): These can knock me out, making it easier to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as you might imagine, both of the above options aren&amp;#39;t suitable in the long term, and while they allow me to fall asleep more easily, they sometimes have the opposite effect in the morning with potential hangovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.0 - My Current Goal:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is quite simple: to get at least &lt;strong&gt;7-8 hours of normal sleep&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;feel refreshed and mentally active&lt;/strong&gt; as soon as I start the day, allowing me to live a normal life like most other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.0 - Sleep Tracking Screenshots:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m attaching several screenshots of my &lt;strong&gt;Fitbit/Google Fit&lt;/strong&gt; tracking my current sleep activity. I&amp;#39;m sharing different screenshots taken from various days.

,insomnia,"I started a new birth control at the start of September. After a week of taking it, I started to have issues sleeping. I also had a stressful event, but I told my doctor I thought the birth control messed with my mood and gave me headaches too etc, so I went off birth control.

,insomnia,"21M, for the past couple of years I have been averaging 3-4 hours of sleep per night. The last \~6 months I've been down to 2-3 hours occasionally going a night without sleeping. I don't think I've been on a regular sleep schedule of 5+ hours since probably middle school. I'm in university (currently on an internship), but do well in school and generally do not struggle with any anxiety (with the exception of worrying about not sleeping). My problem is that I can not go to sleep until I feel absolutely exhausted, and even then it takes at least an hour to fall asleep. If I try and fall asleep at 11pm, I toss and turn for hours and can never fall asleep before 3am but usually around 4am (I wake up at 6:30 for work). I've recently been taking over the counter melatonin gummies but even taking them in larger quantities doesn't seem to help. I'm just not capable of shutting my brain off to sleep, I'm always thinking about whatever game I was just playing or my task at work or the song I was listening to earlier on the radio. My sleep is finally starting to get low enough that it's effecting my work and my personal relationships, and I want to try and improve it before it gets even worse.  
  
Does anyone have any recommendations on how to fall asleep earlier or improve my schedule?
