,sleep,"I’m a 17(M) dealing with some pretty serious sleep issues and overall lifestyle problems, and I’m really hoping for advice on how to improve my situation.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve struggled with bad sleep patterns. It’s gotten to the point where I feel like I’m at my breaking point. The biggest challenge is that I live in a household where everyone’s habits are affecting my own. I’m still dependent on my family, so moving out isn’t an option, and I just feel… stuck.

Background:

It’s not just one thing; it’s a combination of my family’s habits, my own self-sabotaging tendencies, and a pattern that’s been in place since COVID-19. I’ve noticed my focus, mental health, and even my physical well-being slipping due to lack of proper sleep, and I honestly feel like I’m digging myself into a deeper hole every day. I’m really motivated to change, but the environment makes it incredibly difficult.

Problems I Face Due to My Family’s Habits:

1: Inconsistent Sleep Schedule: My family’s sleep schedule is chaotic. They rarely go to bed before midnight, sometimes as late as 1 or 2 a.m., and I end up staying up with them out of habit. This makes it nearly impossible to get the recommended 8 hours of sleep.

2: Constant Lights &amp; Noise: Even if I try to sleep early, it’s challenging. They leave lights on, watch TV, or scroll on their phones late into the night. It’s like there’s no “quiet time” in our household, even when I’m desperately trying to wind down.

3: Household Drama: There’s constant arguing and drama in the house. Even if I’m not directly involved, the tense environment is draining. I can’t focus on studying, and the stress just adds to my insomnia.

4: School &amp; Exam Stress: With all this going on, schoolwork becomes overwhelming. I have no energy left to study, and it just feels like a vicious cycle where bad sleep leads to bad grades, which adds more stress, which then affects my sleep even more.

Problems I Cause Myself:

I won’t put all the blame on my family. I know I’ve got my own role in this too.

1: Self-Sabotage: Sometimes I choose not to sleep even when I get the chance. It’s like I’ve trained myself to stay up late, and I don’t know how to break out of this pattern.

2: Long-Standing Sleep Disruption: My sleep patterns have been messed up for the last 5-6 years, especially since COVID-19 hit. Late nights have become my “normal,” but they’re ruining my life. I feel like I’ve forgotten what it’s like to go to bed early, even though that’s what I want.

3: Overthinking &amp; Stress: I’m an overthinker and stress a lot, which just adds to my sleep problems. Every time I try to sleep, my mind runs through all my worries. It’s exhausting, and it puts an immense strain on my brain.

How This is Affecting Me:

Honestly, I feel exhausted every day. Between schoolwork, bad sleep, a poor diet, and unhealthy habits, it feels like I’m on a downward spiral. I’m always tired, I’m not doing well in school, and I don’t even have the energy to work on myself or build better habits. I feel sad, trapped, and desperate to find a solution that can actually work.

Solutions I’m Looking For:

I know I can’t change my family’s habits, but I need to find a way to manage my sleep and overall mental well-being within these circumstances.

Creating a New Sleep Routine: Any advice on ways I can adjust my sleep schedule so I can actually sleep at a decent hour?

~ Products that Might Help: If anyone has product 
recommendations, like sleep masks, white noise machines, or any tools to block out noise and light, I’d be grateful. I’m considering some options on Amazon but need advice on what’s actually effective.

Help with Ear Issues: On top of it all, my ears are in bad shape. They feel swollen and are full of wax, despite not using headphones for over a month. I don’t know what to do about it, and it’s adding to my frustration.

Wrapping Up:

If you’ve made it this far, thank you. I’m not looking for a miracle – just some practical advice on how I can get even a bit of peace in the midst of this chaos. I want to feel like myself again, not someone constantly on the verge of burnout. It’s been years of struggling, and I can’t go on like this.

For example, one time I dreamt that i was driving my car &amp; crashed &amp; woke up. I got into a car accident on that night. 

I dont think i would ever understand dreams. They’re too confusing &amp; too dense sometimes. I dont know what is a message and whats fake.

My head is constantly in a state of extreme high alert, something that I have never experienced.

I lay in bed with not a remote sense of tiredness at all, then the morning comes. I still dont feel tired or sleep in the day. There isn’t one point in the past 11 months where I have felt a single ounce of tiredness, however I am so fatigued, exhausted &amp; in agony. I have lost 5 stone, my skin burns &amp; hurts to move my face. My eyes are in absolute agony 24/7 they are full of floaters &amp; so dry they hurt to move. All my joints are stiff, my muscles cramp &amp; my digestive system is shot to bits. I don’t really feel hunger or thirst, if I do its quite sporadic. 

I am a 31 year old male, have always had very professional &amp; responsible jobs prior to this, which has kept me from working. I haven’t had any health issues prior to this &amp; never needed to take any medication for anything.

Since this has happened I have been given every sleeping medication known to man, at the strongest dose with 0 effect. I have been given all of the benzos (made me feel slightly more relaxed short term, head slowed down a bit) then stopped working. I have been given sedative anti depressants, normal antidepressants (I am not depressed, although this situation is extremely disabling &amp; distressing for me).

None of the medications have knocked me out, most have made me feel more high if anything or made me not feel my legs. 

This is not normal. It’s extremely lonely because nobody believes me apart from my ex-girlfriend (I told her she deserves to have a nice life &amp; shouldnt have to deal with this, as she was getting upset I am not the big strong guy she met) she has seen me awake this whole time, we have been away places but every setting is the same. 

Doctors, mental health teams, psychologists, psychiatrists - they have ran physical tests such as cushings, adrenal tumours &amp; and brain scan back in March this year which showed no abnormalities, they have discharged me from their services. With a referral to CFS/ME department in Bath RUH next month. I am chronically fatigued because I haven’t slept, I do not feel this is the cause. However they have said ‘what do you want us to do’ some have been quite rude, one the other day said ‘I am tired &amp; want to go home’ I understand that this seems unimaginable. But come on, this is so terrifying seeing &amp; feeling like this, its like everything in my body is malfunctioning, I get a racing heart, adrenaline surges, burning in my stomach &amp; throat, sweats in random parts of my body.

Surly theres a specialist somewhere that would be interested in studying this case, even if it could help someone else?

For the past 2 weeks I have not been able to sleep for 8 hours in a row, without fucking exception. I go to bed at 11pm and almost always wake around 3am, sometimes a little later, sometimes earlier.

Is this really forever? I recently got a full metabolic blood test and everything looked normal, I am now awaiting sleep study to test for sleep apnea. And if its not sleep apnea, what could it even be?

,sleep,"Scared

I had dinner and felt extremely tired after and wanted to fight it but took a nap anyway. Literally right after dinner 

While asleep, I had the craziest feeling ever in my head!!! It alarmed me awake and I screamed for my mom and ran outside the bedroom for her bc I was essentially running from what I thought was a medical episode. My heart was PPPOUNDINg. My head was super woozy and I was shaky. I’m better now but still reeling in from all that. Head feels funny still, kinda heavy. Legs a lil week and my arms feel a bit strained

I’m so paranoid of seizures and I’m scared that’s what that was 😞

&lt;p&gt;I had dinner and felt extremely tired after and wanted to fight it but took a nap anyway. Literally right after dinner &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While asleep, I had the craziest feeling ever in my head!!! It alarmed me awake and I screamed for my mom and ran outside the bedroom for her bc I was essentially running from what I thought was a medical episode. My heart was PPPOUNDINg. My head was super woozy and I was shaky. I’m better now but still reeling in from all that. Head feels funny still, kinda heavy. Legs a lil week and my arms feel a bit strained&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so paranoid of seizures and I’m scared that’s what that was 😞&lt;/p&gt;

,sleep,"So, I used to think caffeine wasn’t messing with my sleep. I’d grab a coffee to survive the afternoon slump, but at night I was wide awake, tossing and turning. My mornings sucked, and I was stuck in this loop of exhaustion.

Then I listened to Andrew Huberman and read Matt Walker’s *Why We Sleep*. Turns out, caffeine hangs around way longer than I thought—even small doses in the afternoon were wrecking my deep sleep.

Here’s what I tried, and it actually worked:

I skip coffee right after waking up and start with water instead. Waiting 60-90 minutes before the first sip lets my body get rid of adenosine (chemical that makes you sleepy) naturally, instead of just masking the feeling. I’ve also started microdosing caffeine (15-30 mg) every few hours. It keeps my energy smooth, no more jitters. And yeah, I cut off all caffeine by 2 PM since your body can't get rid of it for 6-8 hours after.

Hydrating with every dose made a difference too. Just water + a pinch of salt. After a few days, I was falling asleep faster and waking up feeling a lot better. Now I don’t even need that afternoon coffee. My focus is way better because my energy stays steady throughout the day.

Caffeine isn’t the enemy—it just has to be used smarter. If you’re struggling with sleep, try tweaking your caffeine routine. Skip the coffee first thing, spread small doses, and cut it off early. If the afternoon crash hits, take a walk or try some NSDR (non-sleep deep rest) instead of another cup.

I'm 18, and I don’t do much during the day. I have a dummy school so I don’t need to go every day.

,sleep,"In the last 2 weeks, I've been trying to get 7-9 hours of sleep like you're supposed to do. I looked at my fitbit sleep data for the last few years and my average has been 6hrs or less. How that actually looks on a weekly basis is 2-6hrs on for work nights and 7-12hrs on weekends trying to catch up. Not great. 

But I've been learning a lot about sleep lately and why getting 8-9 is so important for your sleep cycles and your brain. And I'm tired of anxiety and depression and my cycle of undermining self-care efforts by not getting enough sleep. So here I am. 

Feeling rested is really new for me so I'm not sure what's normal. I used to only dream on weekends - I presume because I wasn't getting enough sleep on weeknights to get to those stages. Now that I'm sleeping 7-9hrs most nights, I'm having dreams most nights too. Which is normal I guess. But the content of the dreams has been causing me some distress. 

It's always the same handful of heavy topics and thematic constants with minor variances. I don't recall having any fun or silly dreams lately. 

Family dynamics, and the house I spent my formative years in always shows up. Or stuff with my ex. Weird dream scenarios that echo the trauma I experienced in real life due to him. In both of those, me yelling and calling them out which I never did in real life. Or the place where I spent my childhood. It's not a place I can easily visit. So I often have dreams where I found some way back there and spend the whole dream reminiscing about that special time and place and often am sharing it with someone I care about. 

I know dreams are usually just dreams. But why do these topics keep coming up? Is my brain like, catching up on all the ""cleaning"" it needs to do now that I'm getting enough sleep? Do I just need to wait it out and let my subconscious figure out what it needs to? They put me in such a sad and weird headspace when I wake up. And now that it's happening on work days, it's making mornings harder. 

I searched some posts on here that said melatonin might be causing it. I only take 3mg but maybe I'll try skipping it and see if it gets better. But what if this is something deeper that I need to do some work on - more conscious level work? Deep-rooted trauma that only comes out in the stillness of sleep?

And one reason is is because I'm not responsible with those sorts of things, and used to drink and drug til the wheels literally fell off. Thankfully after years of doing that I wa smart enough to recognize it and it was an easy choice to stop. So about two years ago I took a Benadryl for maybe the first time.. and it fucked me up.. and because I don't do any drugs or drink.. but remember the feeling, I enjoyed it. So shortly after I graduated to the blues I mentioned earlier. Just sleep aide diphenhydramine. Well, it go to the point of taking on average about 300mg a night, or 6 50mg pills. Absolutely fucking terrible. I would not sleep at all if I didn't take them then. And to be a little blunt, I think it was messing my insides up as well, as I had blood in my stool almost every time u til I stopped taking them recently. I think this is a terrible drug to take, and even more terrible to become dependent on. It is disgusting. But maybe I am an addict, and that on top of fear of not getting sleep, just drove me to a huge dependency. I knew I had to quit this but it was hard, the fear of not sleeping would win almost every night and I'd continue. Well, eventually like I said about two months ago I just had to put mind over matter and fucking stop. I needed real natural sleep. Another thing about the mega dose of diphenhydramine is I would sleep until like 1pm on average if I didn't have work, which I was also hating. I went a few weeks sleeping pretty bad coming off it it. But recently I have discovered something that has helped incredibly to fall asleep. That is, just focusing on my breathing.

I'm seasoned concert-goer. Usually I just go to one and then return home on the same day. But I came to Prague yesterday because there was Within Temptation concert and now I'm going to see Arch Enemy.

A day before the WT concert, I returned from a night shift and then slept for 6-8 hours with couple previous days being without usual 8-hour sleep. Then I was trying to fall asleep the same evening, because I had to get up early in the morning. It took me long time to fall asleep and I'm not sure if I slept 1 hour or 4 (not any longer than 4).

Yesterday, I felt sleepy during few hours before the show started. I went to a cheap (but nice) hotel where I had reservation and wanted to catch up with my sleeping. But I could only sleep for another 4 hours because it was for multiple people and they awoke me at around 4:45 am and I couldn't fall asleep again.

Right now, I feel bit tired and certain disconnect between my mind and my body. To make it worse, the concert ends at 11:05 pm and my bus home departs on 3:35 am.

,sleep,"Hello,

For a 2 years now. I have suffered pretty poor sleep. but to be honest I never really slept well. I had a sleep study and it came back negative for sleep apnea, but I still feel like my sleep quality is very poor. I wake up 3-4 times int he middle of the night, and throughout the day I feel VERY tired. It's gotten quite bad to the point where I've almost fell asleep multiple times while driving. I'm too tired to do any university work and too tired to work on any of my projects. I understand it might be UARS or another disorder but I not sure how to diagnose further.

I have a deviated septum that I think might be causing poor sleep, which I am on the public list to getting surgery for (1-2 years wait time). I have a slightly recessed chin and overbite which I am on track to getting DJS for (by the end of next year). I am EXTREMELY allergic to grass, I take allergy medication and am considering getting allergy shots.

Could I have any advice on how to proceed further? Clinics around me seem to be useless and only really treat sleep apnea.

I do believe I might have anxiety, slight depression stemming from work, uni among other personal factors, but It has improved over the last month and sleep remains unchanged.

I have had sleep issues my whole life, and lately it's been me waking up an hour to an hour and a half before my alarm.

I keep groaning on the thought of not wanting something to happen to me while I was in this vulnerable stage but I stopped resisting and just un tensed my body and it stopped. This time I felt a weird amount of energy in my body so I tried to move my body up real fast so I would sit against my headboard but when I tried the same thing happened where my body just went limp and got really tight. This happened 2 or 3 more times before I snapped out of it and sat up to grab my phone. I went up to use the bathroom to make sure I wasn&amp;#39;t still in a dream and my legs felt shakey and i practically had to drag myself to the bathroom bouncing off any wall to get to the bathroom. Definitely not the traditional sleep paralysis experience so If this doesn&amp;#39;t seem normal pleas me know so I can make sure it&amp;#39;s not some medical condition.&lt;/p&gt;

,sleep,"Hello all,

Most of my life I have been a really good sleeper (barring a few months in college where I had insomnia due to stress and trying to sleep too early causing poor sleep/middle of the night wake ups).

About a month and a half ago I started having trouble sleeping through the night. The first couple weeks it didn't bother me too much because I am still functional in the day/not tired and I just figured it would take awhile to get back to my normal good sleep, but now that its gone on for a few additional weeks I'm finding myself frustrated and looking for help.

It takes me anywhere from 10 min to an hour to get back to sleep and I do remain asleep for hours, but at this point I haven't been able to sleep for more than 6 consecutive hours (average closer to 4) when usually I can sleep a full 8+.

Here are a few things I'm attributing the change to:

**Special PT** \- I have a condition called lymphedema where your affected limb swells and a treatment is to use high compression leg wraps 23/6 for a time to reduce the swelling back to a baseline. I've been in treatment for about the same time as this issue has been going on. During nights earlier in treatment the compression was too tight at times, and I would have to wake up to take it off (and then promptly I'd fall back asleep no issues). I think this really may have set off the broken sleep as 2-3 weeks ago I had to do this multiple nights in a week. At this point everything is fitting well and I'm not waking up due to pain, but the sleep break persists.

**Stress** \- I'm waking up directly after or during a dream each time. Usually the dream is a bad one (not a true nightmare where I wake up in terror) and I find that my mind is in conflict with a person in the dream and so I'm waking up carrying on the conflict in my mind (thoughts racing). I have to remind myself I am safe/ok and then I can usually fall back asleep. This to me signals my cortisol levels are high but it feels like a chicken and egg thing at this point.

**Inconsistent sleep schedule** \- In my past insomnia space, my issue was in part trying to go to bed before my body was ready to. It ballooned into this whole thing for months and I was finally able to break the cycle one night when I went to bed at like 3 am after a club night and was able to sleep until 9-10 a.m. (previously I was only sleeping for like 1-2 hours before waking up/ 4-5 hours per night and the sleep was poor during this 6 month period it lasted). I've tried something similar this time, going to bed at midnight because maybe I'm not as tired as I think I am, but this hasn't worked to reconnect the gap (singular gap - I'm fully asleep before and fully after). Just to note the last long term sleep issue even in college was 8 years ago and since then I may have had up to a week of poor sleep from time to time but everything returns back to normal.)

Does anyone have any tips on how I can fix the break in my cycles?

**TLDR -** I'm no longer able to sleep through the night as I once was (no consistent sleeping issues prior). I have some ideas as to why it started, and I'd like to know how to return to normal sleep for me (8 consecutive hours).

,sleep,"Hello,
Ive been dealing with something weird lately and i couldnt get any helpful results on it, not even sure what im meant to look up really, so i thought of sharing this here incase anyone else experiences this or has any advice or knowledge to share.

Lately, when I've been falling asleep, ive been experiencing a really weird feeling of my body or bodyparts shrinking or expanding in size. I used to experience this to some degree throughout my life and that seemed normal to me, but the way its been happening lately and the severity of it really alarms me. I can only describe the feeling as what i imagine AIWS feels like. 
Here's an example from yesterday - my head grows to be as big as half of the room, my arms and legs shrink to the size of a mouse and it feels like the room is closing in on me while the bed just keeps getting longer and my legs fade away like a ghost. This only happens when i close my eyes, i can move my limbs but the size perception doesnt change. Not all of these spells go in that exact order, sometimes it can vary, but either way my perception of object size gets incredibly skewed.
I've never suffered from claustrophobia, but god - the fear and anxiety i feel in that state can be considered a glimpse into it. My heart races, i involuntary start breathing faster and heavier, and i feel like there is too much and too little space at the same time. 
As mentioned earlier, i can only describe the feeling as how i imagine AIWS feels based on the simulations I've seen, though of course i dont know if they're an accurate depiction

If this info helps in any way, i dont have anything diagnosed but i suffer from body dysmorphia and i generally have a bit of difficulty with motor skills. I have never experienced sleep paralysis in my life, but it feels like in in a state of semi paralysis when i have one of these spells.
Im also an avid nicotine and pot smoker, and i think it might be a contributor as i generally do feel floatier/dreamier when im buzzed. Thoughts?
As of colder temperatures ive also been consistently sleeping with a heavy electric blanket, and this wild size perception only truly shines when im bundled up in that warm, cozy, heavy blanket. I haven't tried sleeping without it, but i think it might help if it's off, I'll try it out tonight!

Naturally I sleep around 12 hours till I'm not super tired anymore (sleeping a normal amount per day doesn't help and I'll just be more tired and exhausted, it's not oversleeping)

One theory I have why sleep is so exhausting are my dreams. I don't think I really enter deep sleep much, but am in REM sleep for an ungodly amount. 

My dreams last very long, a ton will happen in a single dream. Every dream is a ton of situations in the same 'world'. It lasts over multiple irl hours. This morning I had a dream that must have gone on for like 4h irl. I will oftwn wake up out of an ongoing dream that has already been long, fall back asleep and wake up a few hours later out of the same dream after constant dream action. 

Sometimes in my dreams it feels like my mind is getting exhausted having to make the dream go on and on, the contents of the dream start to feel like filler or scenes from earlier in the same dream repeat

,sleep,"Hi! My partner and I are (fairly recently) no longer long distance. Yayy!! From 8 hrs away to 15 mins 😁😁 As such we've been spending a lot of time together, usually the whole entire weekend - more often at their place than at mine. 

The problem is we have WILDLY different sleep needs. This probably would've come up earlier in the relationship if it weren't for, well, long distance.

When I go to sleep I have the fan on, room pitch black, blankets, usually no sound but occasionally I'll play rain sounds or white noise. Unfortunately I can't fall asleep with anything like a sleep mask on my face. I feel like this is pretty standard?

My partner, on the other hand... TV on, usually really loud, playing the cartoon gumball and Darwin. HAS to be gumball. String lights are also on as well as purple LEDs on their bedframe. They also snore usually really bad 😓 and they're started doing this thing where it's like SNORE uhhh SNORE huhhh SNORE mmm SNORE uhhh ... like, groaning in between each snore? Super bizarre and it gets really loud! Also sleep talking, a lot, moving around constantly, and a couple accidentally kicks and whacks in the nose. 

When I spend the night over there I usually lay awake until 5-6 am when i just pass out from being exhausted despite the noise and light. :( I've tried wearing headphones, but it's difficult to sleep with them on and I just have to turn them up too loud to drown out the TV. The volume is only at like 10 but I guess in the nighttime silence it's blaring. At my house it's a LITTLE better? They can connect headphones to my TV. Still super bright :/ I take melatonin and will literally lay there with a pillow over my head! 😓😓

I just don't know what to do! We've talked about it a lot but we just can't seem to come to a solution where both of us can sleep comfortably. They feel terrible about me not sleeping well but if they try to sleep my way they will jolt awake multiple times in a cold sweat from, like, night terrors? I don't want to say nightmares. It's much worse. When we sleep their way this usually still happens at least once every night. Sit bolt up absolutely petrified sometimes crying. The dreams are usually scary but nonsensical (chased by Michael Jackson yes I'm serious, fight with sister, zombie apocalypse). I've been begging them to get a sleep study done because they're so tired all the time and I really don't see how they can be getting any rest that way. 

Am I just not used to sleeping with other people ? I've never had a problem with sleeping with friends, but none of them have had a problem with me turning off the lights and the TV. I am just at the end of my rope. I love spending time with them but it's just so exhausting not sleeping all weekend, and then I get really irritable, and I just want us both to sleep well.

,sleep,"Hi r/sleep

So I have had insomnia for the last 2 years or so. I fall asleep just fine, but I keep waking up for an hour at a time 2 or 3 times a night, sometimes I can’t get back to sleep at all.

I practice good sleep hygiene, no coffee after lunchtime, blue light blocking lightbulbs, various supplements which are supposed to aid sleep, nothing helps.

My doctor has prescribed in the past trazadone, amytryptiline, circadin, zopiclone, none of these help me stay asleep.

The only thing I noticed allows me to sleep a full 7+ hours is if I consume alcohol in large quantities.

Anyway I called my doctor today and asked if they would refer me to a sleep clinic and the doctor was super reluctant, saying things like ‘how do you think it would help’ I said well maybe I have some kind of brain abnormality. And she said ‘well if we found that how would it help? We try to focus on treating the problem not to identify it’ it was completely bizarre, I felt like I was in an episode of the twilight zone.

She referred me to sleep station, I don’t have high hopes as my insomnia doesn’t seem to be linked to stress levels, and occurs independently of my mental state, nonetheless I thought I would do it just so I can tick it off and I would have more ammo to go back to them with if it failed, and if it helped by some miracle-great.

So I went on there and filled out the self referral. And it said my postcode wasn’t eligible and I would have to pay £135 to use the service.

Of course I feel quite annoyed about it. Is there anyone who has used the service who can telll me if they think it is worth the money or give me advice what to do in my situation.

For context I am otherwise healthy and do regular exercise, eat healthy meals, am of a healthy weight, don’t smoke, rarely drink (maybe three times a year)

I was on zolpidem 5mg increased to 10mg which I have gotten resistance as well.
I have been changed to clonazepam 0.5mg(benzo),  which still isnt even giving a bit sedating a z drug would give. It was changed to clonazepam + escitalopram.
My blood pressure remains high 160-170/80 even after taking medications, i was advised a particular sleeping pills with propanol.
All of this and due to deprivation my behaviour has been affected I have lost a few nice relations.
Anyone who went through this, what did you do? I tried meditation, aromatherapy all that shit ain't working.

,sleep,"This will most likely be very long so I’ll try best

I (18M) have been experiencing sleep issues for probably the last 4-5 years. Since 8th grade I’ve noticed problems when trying to go to bed at night/ waking up in morning. 

Some background:

I’ve used multiple alarms clocks over the years for example, a screaming meanie (about 120 decibels, almost equivalent to a jet plane taking off), a vibrating thing that shook my bed, regular alarm clocks, and recently I even installed new recessed lights in my bedroom with a smart switch and have it set to the time I need to be awake. 10/10 times I need a whole other person to come into my bedroom and wake me up and even then I am a pain in the ass to them. I mumble, fight, and I don’t remember anything that happens during those moments. I am also insanely tired and just feel so lazy throughout the day. I can’t control it at all. I’ve dozed off behind the wheel and fell asleep in every first - second period class in high school.  

On top of all of this I do encounter horrible sleep paralysis almost every other night. I go into a paralysis, shake my self out and I am right back into one. Sometimes it even turns into lucid dreaming and it is horrible. Back to the first paragraph, I was sound asleep in almost all my first period classes in my senior year. Every time I was being woken up from a friend or I would wake up myself somehow there was a 50/50 chance I was in a sleep paralysis. The one was really bad. I was in a SP and my buddy kept shaking me to wake me. I felt everything and heard everything. As I broke out of it I sat myself up straight quickly fell back into a SP. I lost control of my whole body and fell, landing straight on my head. Jesus that was a horrible concussion. 

I have had a history of sleep walking. One time I was opening my window, other times Ive tried to fight family members, I’ve apparently ate a bowl of soup while sleeping (it’s on video) and all of this is some form of sleep walking. 

I had a sleep study done. I was negative for any sort of sleep apnea. The doctor diagnosed me with “primary narcolepsy without cataplexy”. I was prescribed Modafinil. A stimulant that helps me stay awake through out work and the day. It really does help but after only a month I’ve gotten use to it and had to double the dosage. 

I’m happy I can stay awake throughout the day pretty good now but I am still having sleep paralysis at night and I am impossible to wake up in the morning. I’m really just looking for any sort of help or anyone that has experienced something similar to this. I feel like there’s more wrong to me than the narcolepsy. 

Also I had bloodwork done and everything turned out fine there.

,sleep,"hi everybody! this is my first time posting on reddit ever cause i badly need help. I’m a 24f. 

Ever since the last week of june 2024 i haven’t had a good sleep. i’d have a good first few hours of sleep, maybe an hour or 2- 4 hours max, then wake up at around 1 or 2am to just be closing my eyes till it’s actually time to get up. i’m relatively active. i wake up early around 7:30am to 9am, i either go for a long run or do a workout (weight lifting or pilates) in the morning. i have pcos and endometriosis so i stay away from gluten, dairy, and sugar most days. i also got back on birth control pills in May 2024. i resigned from my Job in July thinking it was the stress but the sleep hasnt gotten any better (honestly living a peaceful life rn so can’t be stress) i implement a strict morning and evening routine. in the morning i immediately get out of bed, view sunlight, have breakfast, then only then do i have caffeine. i always do my workouts in the morning cause any later would keep me up. at night i take a warm shower, journal &amp; meditate before bed. 

the only thing i can think to disrupt my sleep for the first time in 24 years was that i started running a lot. i ran my first half marathon around the time my sleep started getting disrupted. i continued to run trail runs after (even got extremely sick the week after my first half marathon &amp; 12km trail run where i had to be on antibiotics). i’ve also started seeing floaters in my eyes since then. although im not certain about this cause there are people who run way more than i do and can sleep like a baby. 

could also be that im eating more now that ive started running? but not to any extremes compared to in the past. i just can’t take this anymore and i dont know what to do. i workout so much and dont recover well because even if im extremely sleepy and pass out at night, ill wake up at 1am and cry from frustration that i can’t fall back asleep. i miss having a full 8 hour deep sleep and i never thought it would be such a privilege… please any leads!?

,sleep,"Just curious to see if anyone else has had a similar experience. Long post. 

Around the time I was 12 (now 28F) I started having extremely vivid hypnopompic/hypnagogic hallucinations. I would get stuck in a cycle of waking up having them over and over. This was accompanied by sleep paralysis. I would also get sleep paralysis while falling asleep for naps, especially if the room was warm and sunny. I used to just lay in bed all day as a teen whenever I would have the chance and drift in and out of sleep. 

While the sleep paralysis occurs way less often now, I still experience hypnopompic hallucinations multiple times a week along with nightly awakenings about 20-30 minutes  after going to sleep (my husband usually says i am freaking out about something, even if i don't remember the next morning).The hallucinations are mostly visual and tactile. I am also very tired during the day no matter how much i sleep. Sometimes the feeling of sleepiness is so extreme it's like I just want to lay down wherever I am. I can barely focus. I can fight through it and have never fallen asleep not meaning to, but it sucks. 

16 years of this and I casually mention this to a resident PCP im seeing for a physical. She leaves the room for awhile and comes back and tells me i probably have narcolepsy and that I need a sleep study. I get a PSG and then see a sleep neurologist. My sleep latency was 6 min and rem latency was 55 min. A few central apneas but no obstructive apneas. My sleep neurologist is excellent and takes a thorough hx and agrees with narcolepsy. I think this is so crazy. 

So I get a PSG and MSLT (nap test). My sleep latency on the PSG is 6 min again but REM was normal. I slept 4/5 naps on my MSLT, but my sleep latency was 9 min-13 min. Very normal. And I did not go into REM. Meaning this isn't narcolepsy. I haven't seen my doc for follow up yet. 

Edit: I was EXTREMELY pumped up during the MSLT. Like heart pounding I was so anxious because I had waited 8 months to get to the point of being tested. And 16 years for someone to listen to me. I do feel like someone with narcolepsy probably would've still slept through this, though.

Has anyone else had these symptoms and been diagnosed with anything other than narcolepsy or IH? I know other things like psychiatric disorders can cause sleep issues like this, but all I have is some depression. I am completely healthy otherwise. I know hypnopompic hallucinations can be normal for everyone to have, but I just feel like the extent to which I have them is abnormal.

,sleep,"Hello. 

As the title suggests, the problem i will talk about is related to naps. Because of personal problems, i've been following a fragmented, but regular, sleep routine. Currently, i'm sleeping from 9pm to 1:30am, 5:30am to 6:00am and 13:30 to 14:00. The sleep time is, indeed, low, but the sleep debit is accumulating in a very slow pace. That's an important information.

The problem i'm facing is with the quality of the naps. Whenever i try to nap, i simply don't feel like i fell asleep. I simply stay there, with closed eyes, hoping that i'll, eventually, sleep. Initially, i thought that time would solve that problem, since the increasingly sleep pressure wold make the act of falling asleep easier. However, curiously, as i said, despite my apparently poor sleep quality and low sleep time, the sleep debt accumulation is extremely low, and i simply can't understand why. I'm pretty sure i'm not entering the REM or SWS phases during sleep, since i don't feel even the minor amount of groggyness when i wake up, and that would, theorically, result in a very fast accumulation of sleep debt, but that's not what's happening.

Before I start, I AM seeing a doctor and I DO have a sleep study scheduled in December. I’d just like to hear if anyone has any input. My doctors can’t figure out why the hell this is happening, I’ve ran the whole gamut of blood tests and other diagnostic measures and nothing is popping out.

Eating makes it worse, although physical activity makes it marginally better.

,sleep,"Hi guys, 

I have anxiety and also insomnia, and it's been a year this month since I started having insomnia. Since then, I was prescribed 50mg of trazodone. I've been taking it, sometimes 25mg, other times 100mg or 50mg, varying between these doses. The trazodone puts me to sleep, but I end up waking up every 2 hours and feel tired when I wake up to go to work.

At the pharmacy, they recommended several natural supplements, but the effect was mainly drowsiness during the night, and I still woke up feeling tired.

So I tried PlexusVita G47 Sleep:

* California Poppy - 200 mg
* Cyracos® - 150 mg (never tried it)
* GABA - 150 mg (never tried it)
* Hops - 100 mg (never tried it)
* Melatonin - 1 mg

I slept better, woke up fewer times, and felt more energized, but I still have ups and downs.

Then I saw this supplement NOW Foods, Sleep, Botanical Sleep Blend:

* 600mg Valerian Root
* 200mg Passionflower
* 200mg GABA
* 300mg Hops and other plants.

My question is whether I can take 50mg of trazodone and try this supplement? Or could there be a problem with serotonin syndrome due to these plants, especially valerian root? Can someone help me?

,sleep,"Hello

20F. I have really intense anxiety and stress everyday, which leads to poor sleep, sleep paralysis, and nightmares about my stressors pretty much everyday. Multiple extremely vivid, bad dreams per night.

Sleep has always been a hassle for me.
I’ve had insomnia, frequent sleep paralysis, and nightmares for a very long time. I actually take prescribed medication to sleep, but it only helps me fall asleep. After about four hours I wake up and can’t go back to sleep for hours because my nightmares were so bad that I’m just left an anxious mess. This also always results in sleep paralysis while I’m trying to get more sleep. Over and over and over again. It’s not just once. Not only that, but as I’m falling asleep, I can feel my body slowly begin paralysis, and it’s so scary that I forced myself to not sleep, for fear of getting into a full on paralysis moment.

I’m not new to sleep paralysis, first time it happened I was nine. When I was 14 I went to neurologist and was told I would grow out of it. Then came the pandemic which was some of the worst and most grueling insomnia and sleep paralysis of my life. And overall terrible anxiety after that.

I’ve taken different anxiety medications with increasing dosages, neither of which seemed to really do anything for me.

All of this is in my hands, I’m not really searching for answers. I do believe it is anxiety driven, but I would like to check in with a neurologist again.
 Just sharing my experience.

But still, sleep paralysis is very scary, and I fear that I will never be able to move again. And there have been times where I slipped into sleep paralysis accidentally while shifting my body in my sleep, where my neck was in a bad position, and I was nearly choking. I can get into paralysis very quickly. Those times where I'm nearly choking are scariest, especially when I read that your esophagus relaxes so it already feels a little difficult to breathe with sleep paralysis.

Also lately I’ve been having sleep orgasms, like multiple times a week which is new. Don’t really know why but I’m not concerned, I don't think I should be, but I think it's funny. But also embarassing when I wake up.

Again, not really looking for help, just sharing what I'm going through. I wish sleep was easier, though.

,sleep,"I've been having trouble with some noisy housemates this semester.  I finally bit the bullet and bought ear plugs.  I was able fall asleep about an hour into my housemate's loud party on Friday.  Despite being awoken by a fire alarm in the middle of the night, I felt cautiously okay Saturday morning.

Saturday night, I fell asleep within about 15 min, right around the start of their next party.

Sunday, I also used the earplugs.  Despite it being quiet when I went to bed on Sunday, I felt way more rejuvenated compared to my usual self this morning and I can't help but share how vital earplugs have been.  I singlehandedly feel way more free to go to bed when I want, and the quality of my sleep and energy during the day seems to have improved.

I highly recommend you try earplugs, even if you don't have the loudest environment.  It might boost your sleep quality and energy levels.

Right now, the only issue I've seen is that both Saturday and Sunday night, I seem to  wake up around 3:30am after falling asleep around 11pm.  During that time, I'll take out my earplugs and go back to bed until about 6am.  I fell back asleep in under 10 min both times.  I'm going to see if I can sleep through a full night tonight though.

Edit: Just tried the Equate earplugs instead of the 3M.   I like the 3M ones way better, will probably stick with those.

Edit 2: Monday night, I slept 11pm\~ to just past 5am.  I didn’t fall back asleep but took out my earplugs and rested until 6:30.  I feel really refreshed.

Despite being awoken by a fire alarm in the middle of the night, I felt cautiously okay Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday night, I fell asleep within about 15 min, right around the start of their next party.&lt;/p&gt;

Growing up, I was a star athlete, being top varsity in cross country, swimming and track and field at my prestigious private school with hopes to go D1. I ultimately did not go that route due to lifestyle factors, but I do try to keep that sort of exercise up in college. 

As of recently (the last month-ish) I have noticed there is a direct correlation between getting bad sleep and running during the day. I have kept a sleep journal and noticed this is a pattern on every day in which the night I get horrid sleep. I lift everyday as well, but days where I just lift seem to have no effect on my sleep.

Basically, I go the whole 9 yards when it comes to perfectly optimizing my sleep.

Does anyone have any possible ideas on what could be causing running during the day to absolutely destroy my sleep, even though before this was a problem I had 5+ years of high-level competitive running experience in which my sleep was never a problem?

Some of the other things I take are 10mg Doxapin, Magnesium glycinate or threonate (alternated), and 250 mg of Apigenin. Could glycine suddenly start causing anxiety/depression like that? Has this happened to anybody else?&lt;/p&gt;

,sleep,"Yes - A confusing title

Long story short my doctor does not want me on Melatonin for more then two weeks. Basically says its bad, but is the only thing that can get me some good sleep while I figure out what is causing my insomnia. I'm basically on my third week of taking it close to daily. I take 1mg. Tried doing 0.5mg and could not sleep. However, there are days I stop completely and sleep the next day and the days after. Other days I stop melatonin and that night I am awake until 3am. Then I take a melatonin to get whatever sleep I can get for the rest of the night.

From what I understand, Melatonin does not take away the body's natural ability to produce melatonin and the body does not come dependent on the supplement, but I am worried I might be doing more harm then good going back and forth from being off of it and back on. I am worried for the recent nights I took it after midnight that I may have shifted my clock that now my body does not feel tired until 2/3am. So I have started to take it at earlier  to try and shift it back and then try to go off of it again.

Questions:

1. Is 1mg daily really that bad? - I would like to get off it completely, some days I am successful others I am not.
2. Do you think I have shifted my internal clock to falling asleep later by taking the melatonin way later in the night then at the start of the night? I do this when I realize I am not falling asleep and get up and grab the pill.
3. How did you stop using Melatonin? In the past (without the sleep issues) If I took one, one night, I was fine without taking until I had another episode again. Call it three pills a year. At the moment I am having a bad case of insomnia and have been using Melatonin to help resolve it, but I am afraid I might be making it worse. This is the longest I have ever used it. I just didn't think it was a big deal cause its the lowest dose I could buy in my country. I don't think I'm dependent on it, the last two weeks I had days where I slept fine, but then I go back to not sleeping around 4/5 day mark and the cycle continues.

I tried magnesium, but that didn't help.

- well, it really differs, it can be none and it can by 30h sleeping straight
- OK, but on average?
- well, an average of 0 and 30 is 15 if you need to put something in your little form, but this is not very helpful in describing someone who can sleep 0 or 30 hours, is it?

- the typical things the sleep trackers have so time in bed vs time sleeping, deep/shallow sleep etc

For the last couple of months, I've been dealing with a recurring issue. Whenever I go to sleep, I suddenly wake up gasping for air, either as I’m falling asleep or in the middle of the night. When this episode occurs, I find myself gasping for air, my body feels briefly paralyzed, and I immediately start to panic. It feels terrifying because I'm fully aware that I'm awake but unable to breathe. Sometimes, I even have to get up and go to the window to get fresh air. It subsides after I take 2-3 deep breaths. Once I’m breathing normally again, I go back to bed. The entire episode lasts about a minute or so.

I don’t snore (confirmed by my partner), but I do talk in my sleep regularly. I used to sleepwalk a lot as a kid, but not anymore.

I think the potential causes could be my irregular sleep patterns, stress and anxiety, and lack of consistent physical activity. I usually take 2-3 walks a day with my dog and go hiking every 2-3 weeks on weekends.

,sleep,"Hey! Trying to understand what is my issue maybe you guys can help me.

I am 25 years old, adhd inattentive (diagnosed unmedicated), quite anxious by nature and a night owl.

I have always been quite random with my sleeping patterns, I can stay up until 4/5 easily if I'm focused on something and I think better in the evening than in the morning.

However until 18 years old it has never been an issue, I was waking up always relatively energized and felt rested with around 7h of sleep average.

When I was 18 years old I got surgery for a very rare bone tumor (non cancerous thankfully) but it was my first big surgery, very traumatic for the reasons you obviously expect.

I believe that my sleep started to degrade from this point.

Nowadays what is my sleep?
Waking up always tired, I never feel rested, like there is a battery leakage and I wake up at 40/60% battery.
I never feel completely sleeping like my brain is always active and thinking (thanks adhd). It's like whenever I put my head on my pillow that my brain starts to nitro and thinks about anything everything all at once.

I can take between 10 min to 2 hours to go to sleep without knowing why, it just.. Happens like that.

I always wake up after 6 hours of sleep whatever my bedtime was. Going to sleep at midnight means waking up at 6am, if 2am then 8 am etc...

I never feel really sleepy to go to sleep, I feel tiredness but not sleepiness.

Usually I go to sleep around 1 am to wake up at 8h30 for work. On weekends I tend to go to sleep later and wake up later.

I know my sleep hygiene is not ideal but what I don't understand is why it's happening now? I've been like that for my whole life and it's like now my brain started to hate sleeping. Usually waking up drenched in sweat.

I have been going through quite stressful periods and I express a lot of anxiety.
I am quite sportive swimming 2 to 4 km per week

It's exhausting I dread going to sleep now because it feels like a waste of time, a bad moment where I will just struggle to find peace to let go.

I am getting beta blockers (5mg) for 10 days now for anxiety, and melatonin (4mg) but don't feel anything better.

Please can you help me.

* Blue light exposure: being a cs major, I have to spend the majority of my day in front of screens, up until half an hour before sleeping
* lifestyle: my sleep schedule is extremely variable, some days I tend to sleep at 11, and as of the moment it is 4 in the morning and still haven't fallen asleep, although this is not usually the case but my bedtime ranges anywhere from 11 to 1, and additionally it takes me a lot of time to sleep, like i don't get knocked out instantly, it usually takes me about 30 to 40 mins to fall asleep on days when I haven't done any physical exercise, and I do not lead a very active life, where i exercise 4-5 times a week, I am trying to change that though, where I exercise more frequently, also my dorm does not have an air conditioner to its kind of hot and stuffy in there in general.

the difference is that when I am at my home( at my parents) I fall asleep right away, because there is no stress and load about what is to be done the next day and plus the temperature is way cooler there so i feel more comfortable and less restless.

,sleep,"Hi, everyone. This isn’t happening to me, but to my wife, and we’re both very concerned. 

Basically, earlier this year I woke up in a panic sending something was wrong. I tried to nudge my wife awake but found that she wouldn’t wake up. Right away she began to snore very loudly and the snore sounded like she had a lot of mucus in it. I called emergency services and they assumed she had a seizure. While they were on their way and once they got there, she seemed awake but not quite there, almost like an absence seizure. She was able to get up onto the gurney and she answered a few questions, but still seemed confused. She eventually woke up in the ER with no memory of the event. 

Earlier this morning, it happened again. Same symptoms and all. I thought she was choking or having a seizure for real this time. She had some spit coming out from the sides of her mouth, but it wasn’t foam like in a seizure. She went to the ER again.

She had several tests done (CT scan and blood test during both ER visits, and later an EEG and MRI). All tests appeared normal. Her neurologist suggested parasomnia as a possible diagnosis. She still needs to get a sleep study done.

Has anyone here or anyone you know experienced similar things? Could it be sleep apnea. We’re both afraid now to go to sleep.

She is 36 and weighs 126 lbs. She does stress a lot due to work, and she isn’t super active other than the occasional walk, and she dances along with music most days.

I have been struggling with fatigue forever. I sleep a lot and usually don't have trouble getting to sleep. I am beginning to suspect I'm not actually relaxing and sleeping well when I'm asleep though.

I've started waking up with clenched fists and I've always been a jaw clencher, it's been much worse recently due to my mental health and medication. I wake up with headaches.

I often wake up super tired even when sleeping 8-9 hrs

I recently read a book about breathing and have been experimenting with trying to keep my mouth closed at night, try to breathe through my nose. I'm a mouth breather.

Last night I must have clenched so much I woke up and had to get painkillers because my head was killing me. I had a jaw strap thingy on to try and keep my mouth gently closed, but I took it off in my sleep. I wonder if that made my jaw clenching worse so i might not do that again.

Sleep Series 544: What is ""Spirit Quotient""? How to obtain 'spiritual vision'?

People have heard of IQ (intelligence quotient), EQ (emotional Quotient), AQ (inverse quotient), but may not have heard of the concept of SQ (spiritual quotient). However, there are several different definitions of spiritual quotient, one refers to the ability to inspire, comprehend, and think intuitively about the essence of things; The second type refers to the spiritual talent of people to explore and pursue high-end missions, visions, and values beyond materialism and fame; The third type refers to the ability to communicate and converse with deities, souls, or deep subconscious, also known as ""spiritual vision"".

There are many ways to obtain spiritual quotient and spiritual vision, such as:

1. Practice meditation, yoga, meditation, and introspection to relax the mind, develop inner intuition, and even open the ""third eye"" on the forehead to enhance spiritual vision.

2. Carry out lateral thinking and brainstorming, such as random association, lateral combination, reverse reasoning, and multi person interactive brainstorming.

3. Leisure, tourism, and entertainment, such as some people being inspired by relaxing scenes like bathing, walking, playing games, and listening to music.

4. Seeking spiritual guidance from masters such as mentors, gods, experts, or hypnotists for systematic practice and training can more effectively develop spiritual vision.

5. Use auxiliary tools and techniques, such as tarot cards, astrology, mandalas, crystal balls, mirrors, magic houses, dream development, etc., to enhance perceptual abilities and cultivate intuition.

There is a video called ""Opening Spiritual Vision"" that introduces a method of candles and mirrors: in a dark room, light two candles and place them on either side of the mirror, then stare at your own eyes in front of the mirror, take a few deep breaths, clear your mind, gradually enter a trance state, and continue to stare attentively. Gradually, you will notice changes in your face, and then you will see other people's faces overlaid in the mirror. New faces keep appearing, which may be your higher self or past life. You will also see your guiding spirit or protective angel. At this time, you will feel warm, healing, and loving energy entering your body. Continue to gaze around and above your head, and you will see your energy field. After a while, you will see your energy field. Move your gaze to about 20 centimeters above your head, and you will gradually see the outline of your guiding spirit or angel, You can ask him to enter your body, heal your mind and body, and further expand your aura. At this time, you may hear some sounds or see some images communicating with you. Write down these high-dimensional information, which contains knowledge, wisdom, and helpful guidance for your life. Finally, thank the gods, disconnect the link, and look forward to the next spiritual hearing.

,sleep,"Hi there I'm 21 male. Almost 2 months ago my doc prescribed me Trazodone to help get me sleepy for bed. 

Ever since starting the med I've noticed something strange during the day. 

During the day I take Concerta (ADHD meds). Helps wake me up as if it's coffee, making me feel energized and helps me to focus and get work done. After 4 to 5 hours after taking them and having their usual effects kick I'm suddenly hit with a wave of tiredness. I suddenly loose all motivation and focus to work on homework. But I also get a weird feeling in my throat. 

The best I can explain this feeling is as if I'd just drank sprite (or soda). That after effect of drinking sprite making the back of my throat feel tingly. 

But it's that throat feeling, followed later with the feeling like I'm gonna burp a little but never do. After that then it's the feeling of mucus or something in my throat, then it goes away. 

This happens during the afternoon/evening. If it happens before I go to bed (around 11pm I get ready for bed) and I take Trazodone the effect goes away. It's weird.Ithe throat feeling doesn't feel like a tight feeling. I haven't changed my diet habbits for months so it can't be that. I've never had this feeling with allergies, so I don't think it's that either. I was on 50mg 2 weeks ago, started 100mg 2 weeks ago. Been on Trazodone for 6 weeks now.

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s that throat feeling, followed later with the feeling like I&amp;#39;m gonna burp a little but never do. After that then it&amp;#39;s the feeling of mucus or something in my throat, then it goes away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens during the afternoon/evening. If it happens before I go to bed (around 11pm I get ready for bed) and I take Trazodone the effect goes away. It&amp;#39;s weird.Ithe throat feeling doesn&amp;#39;t feel like a tight feeling. I haven&amp;#39;t changed my diet habbits for months so it can&amp;#39;t be that. I&amp;#39;ve never had this feeling with allergies, so I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s that either. I was on 50mg 2 weeks ago, started 100mg 2 weeks ago. Been on Trazodone for 6 weeks now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know no one here can give me an &amp;quot;official diagnosis&amp;quot;. I know that only my doctor can do that. I thought I&amp;#39;d ask here while I wait for my doctor to get back on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is this a common side effect? What might this side effect be? &lt;/p&gt;

,sleep,"Sleep Series 543: Insomnia sufferers may want to learn more astronomy

According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, star clusters in the universe have an impact on human life and health. For example, in the book ""Notes on Internal Syndrome Observation"", the author describes in detail the scenes where 28 constellations and various planets in the solar system transmit true qi and yin-yang substances to the five organs and meridians of the human body. For example, the ginseng constellation is like ginseng in the sky, delivering nutrients and replenishing qi and blood through the large intestine. The distribution of 28 constellations is as follows:

Eastern Azure Dragon: Jiaosu, Kangsu, Disu, Fangsu, Xinsu, Weisu, Jisu

Northern Xuanwu: Dou Su, Niu Su, Nu Su, Xu Su, Wei Su, Shi Su, Bi Su

Western White Tiger: Kuisu, Lou Su, Wei Su, Subaru, Bi Su, Zhi Su, Shen Su

Southern Vermilion Bird: Jingsu, Guisu, Liusu, Xingsu, Zhangsu, Yisu, Tongsu

These celestial bodies provide us humans with the same meticulous care as parents do for their children, but we generally do not feel it. Therefore, we need to consciously observe the scene of our individual merging with the entire universe and stars. When we can't sleep for a while, there's no need to worry. Just slow down your breathing and devoutly accept the true energy and energy transmitted by these stars. The more calm and relaxed our minds are, the better the absorption effect will be, and our bodies can also get better rest.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance. &lt;/p&gt;

I've found that I need to let my mind wander in order to fall asleep. I've often asked people close to me how they fall asleep and what they think about when they're falling asleep, I always get the ""I don't think of anything"" response which blows my mind. What is not thinking of anything? Do people just think black nothingness or what? I've tried that, and it can work... after an hour to 2 hours...
What really works for me is just letting my thoughts wander from thing to thing until I get to a thing that just smoothly takes over my brain, usually playing something out, realistic or fantasy. Does this work for other people?

My only concern is performance at the gym later today- would a tsp of coffee grinds to keep me awake be an okay remedy to mitigate today’s lethargy? I never have coffee or any form of caffeine routinely (besides chocolate).&lt;/p&gt;

It’ll just make you **exhausted**—especially if your body isn’t wired for mornings.

Chronotypes are your **genetically programmed sleep rhythms**. Fight against them, and you get burnout. Work with them, and things flow effortlessly. Here’s the breakdown:

* **Wolves 🐺**: Late-night workers who struggle before noon.
* **Dolphins 🐬**: Light sleepers who need flexibility.

,sleep,"While I spend most of my time helping people get better sleep, meaning not staying up at night worrying or fighting, I do spend a good amount of time flying to visit clients and have noticed how some people struggle to sleep during a flight. 
So I’ve pulled together a few bits of advice on how to sleep when traveling via the air. 
As always, if you need help falling asleep due to worry or stress, I’m happy to talk. 

Here’s advice on how to fall asleep during a flight:

Dear Weary Traveler,

Falling asleep during a flight can be tricky, but with the right techniques, you can drift off and arrive at your destination feeling refreshed. Here are five tips to help you catch some Z’s while up in the air:

1. Prepare Your Environment:**
   - Bring a Neck Pillow: Supporting your neck will help prevent discomfort and allow your head to rest in a natural position. Invest in a quality neck pillow to avoid waking up with a stiff neck.
   - Use an Eye Mask: The bright cabin lights or sunlight can make it hard to relax. An eye mask blocks out light and helps signal to your body that it’s time to rest.

2. Use Noise-Canceling Headphones or Earplugs:
   - Airplane noise can be disruptive, whether it’s the hum of the engine or the chatter of fellow passengers. Noise-canceling headphones or simple earplugs can create a quieter environment, making it easier to fall asleep.

3. Skip the Caffeine and Alcohol:
   - While it might be tempting to grab a coffee or have a drink before your flight, caffeine and alcohol can interfere with your ability to sleep. Opt for water or herbal tea instead to stay hydrated and promote relaxation.

4. Get Comfortable with Your Seat Position:
   - Recline your seat if possible, and make sure you’re comfortable before trying to fall asleep. Adjust your seatbelt so it’s snug but not restrictive, and use a blanket or scarf to stay warm.

5. Practice Relaxation Techniques:
   - Use deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation to calm your body and mind. Close your eyes and take slow, deep breaths, focusing on relaxing each part of your body from head to toe. This can help signal your brain to wind down and prepare for sleep.

A Thought to Sleep On:

Sleep on a flight doesn’t always come easily, but with the right preparation and mindset, you can create a peaceful environment that helps you relax and drift off. Remember, a little preparation goes a long way when it comes to getting rest in the sky.

Wishing you restful travels and peaceful sleep,
Dr. Goodnight

,sleep,"Sleep Series 541: The Creator is a mischievous child, you may just be a clone of him!

There is a hypothesis that suggests that everyone is a clone created by the Creator, and the Creator obtains various experiences through each clone, which is why humans have millions of different destinies. Some people are happy throughout their lives, some are miserable throughout their lives, some achieve success at times, and some are miserable at times. However, the Creator may also experience the miracle of changing one's destiny through some people, so no matter what your fate is, don't be too desperate!

So there is a question, since the Creator is omnipotent, why does He still create so many unfortunate clones? Perhaps he felt that if all clones were happy, it would be too monotonous, so the Creator is like a mischievous child who likes to seek different stimuli!

If you happen to be the doppelganger he created who often suffers from insomnia, then you may have to endure a lot of suffering and pain. However, do not complain, but devoutly pray to the Creator and tell him that you have already experienced a lot of insomnia pain. Do you want to reverse it and experience the feeling of going from long-term insomnia to sleeping soundly at night? Besides praying, it's best for you to do something else to make the Creator ""hear"" your prayers as soon as possible, such as expressing gratitude more often, connecting with nature and gods more, doing more good deeds, and so on.

I hope we are all happy clones!

,sleep,"Hi,

I tried searching for similar stuff on here but couldn't find anything quite like it, I was wondering if anyone had any idea what was going on.

So to start with, I woke up sometime between 3:30am - 4am. I felt like i had been woken up, almost like someone had been trying to wake me up or I was filled with adrenaline suddenly. When I tried to move my arms were super tingly, almost numb. Then when I stood up I felt nauseous, not too much but enough to feel off. I felt like I was going to pass out when I stood up, but I was worried something was gonna happen if I laid back down so I kinda just shuffled around the house until I gained feeling in my limbs again and didn't feel so faint anymore.

I know it probably doesn't sound serious but it really freaked me out and when I got to work I started googling my symptoms but nothing quite matched up to the situation so I thought I would ask a bunch of people.

It's also probably worth mentioning that this has never happened to me. I thought it might be sleep paralysis at first, but apparently you can't move at all when that happens so that's not what this is.

I know it could just be nothing, but I was so freaked I'm worried I'm gonna be up all night scared to fall asleep again.

,sleep,"Just as the title says - I have been struggling with chronic insomnia for almost 20 years and I am at my wits end.

Background:
I remember my sleep issues began in middle school. For many years I self medicated with alcohol to help me sleep. I have been sober since 2021 and my sleep problems have been out of whack. I worked night shift for 3-4 years, but have been working normal hours since late 2020. I have trouble falling asleep (tired around 1-4 am), and most recently I have trouble staying asleep. I have been diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder (well controlled), MDD (not currently an issue), and ADHD (treated with adderall IR). Some nights I feel I am in a half-sleep state and wake up every 30 minutes or so. I believe I possibly have DSPD or non-24. I signed up for an at home sleep study next month and will begin CBT-I. 

What I have tried:
* Sleep hygiene: limiting phone and TV before bed, sleep meditation, no caffeine after 2 pm, taking my last adderall dose before 2 pm, working out (before 6 PM)
* Trazodone: doesn't keep me asleep and plugs up my nose to the point I feel I have trouble breathing
* Benadryl: worked for a short period of time, now does nothing
* Melatonin (low dose 3 mg) + l-theanine + magnesium glycinate (200 mg): worked for a short period of time, now does nothing
* Gabapentin - doesn't help and just gives me major brain fog
* Hydroxyzine: doesn't help and makes me feel drowsy the next day
* Abilify: had a paradoxical effect and made me wired/more anxious
* Ambien: took for a few months before getting sober, I didn't abuse it but I am scared to take it again since there is a risk of dependence as well as I had sleep-walking and talking events I do not remember when I did take it 

Other meds I take:
* Adderall IR 10 mg twice daily (I take my second dose at around 1:30 PM)
* Propranolol 20 mg 1-2 times daily as needed for anxiety

Advice I want: 
* I am seeing my doctor tomorrow for a short-term medication solution until my sleep study and therapy begins next month. My current regimen or melatonin, l-theanine, magnesium glycinate, and sometimes benadryl at night is no longer effective.

,sleep,"Hey again, everyone!

I wanted to give an update after over a month and a half of using my light hypnosis session before sleep, and I must say, the results have been truly impressive! The most noticeable effect is how quickly I now fall asleep – this has become the number one benefit for me. I also sleep quite deeply, although I sometimes wake up during the night, but I've had no trouble falling back asleep.

I've used this almost every day, even during a two-week trip where I had to share a room with a coworker. Normally, new environments and sharing a room would make me feel restless, but every night before bed, I put on my headphones and played the recording twice. It was enough to help me relax, feel sleepy, and drift off to sleep. I was getting about 7 hours of solid rest, and I woke up feeling refreshed each morning. On one occasion, I woke up after less than 6 hours of sleep, but surprisingly, I still felt completely rested.

I’m not sure if it's the hypnosis working exceptionally well on me or just the power of suggestion, but the results have been great. I encourage anyone to try creating a similar recording for themselves. I'm really curious to hear if others experience the same benefits I have.

I'll try to record my hypnosis session in English soon and share it here so more of you can give it a go!

,sleep,"Sleep Series 540: What is the eighth habit of high-performance individuals?It help sleep!

Many people have heard of the book 'The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People', but may not know that there is another book called 'The Eighth Habit of Highly Effective People: Moving from Efficiency to Excellence'. Alright, let's list these eight habits:

Habit 1: Be proactive; Habit 2: Starting with the end; Habit 3: Prioritize important matters; Habit 4: Win win mindset; Habit 5: Know the enemy and know the friend; Habit 6: Integrated synergy; Habit 7: Continuously update.

Habit 8: Find Your Voice and Inspire Others to Find Their Voice

Find your voice and inspire others to find them.

Stephen Covey pointed out that individuals must first clarify their mission, values, passion, and unique contribution points, that is, their ""voice"". Then, by setting an example and serving others, inspire those around them to discover and express their own feelings.

This concept goes beyond the efficiency and effectiveness that the first seven habits focus on, and focuses more on meaning, purpose, and the sustained development of individuals and organizations. For example, I have a friend who particularly admires Zhuangzi. His mission is to promote Taoist culture, advocate the concept of conforming to nature and the spirit of humanistic care, and make a contribution to enhancing social harmony.

Is finding a personal mission helpful for sleep? I think there are two main points:

1. Having a clear mission and goals can help people reduce confusion and perplexity, develop plans, take action, and continue to push forward, fully immersing themselves in it, thereby gaining inner peace and satisfaction. When faced with problems, they will also be more calm, not take insomnia too seriously, and anxiety and stress will be reduced, thereby improving sleep quality.

2. Having clear direction and goals can inspire individuals to develop a more disciplined lifestyle, such as adjusting their diet, exercising, managing their emotions, practicing and reading, and comprehensively improving their physical and mental health.

&lt;p&gt;Many people have heard of the book &amp;#39;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&amp;#39;, but may not know that there is another book called &amp;#39;The Eighth Habit of Highly Effective People: Moving from Efficiency to Excellence&amp;#39;. Alright, let&amp;#39;s list these eight habits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habit 1: Be proactive; Habit 2: Starting with the end; Habit 3: Prioritize important matters; Habit 4: Win win mindset; Habit 5: Know the enemy and know the friend; Habit 6: Integrated synergy; Habit 7: Continuously update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habit 8: Find Your Voice and Inspire Others to Find Their Voice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find your voice and inspire others to find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Covey pointed out that individuals must first clarify their mission, values, passion, and unique contribution points, that is, their &amp;quot;voice&amp;quot;. Then, by setting an example and serving others, inspire those around them to discover and express their own feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept goes beyond the efficiency and effectiveness that the first seven habits focus on, and focuses more on meaning, purpose, and the sustained development of individuals and organizations. For example, I have a friend who particularly admires Zhuangzi. His mission is to promote Taoist culture, advocate the concept of conforming to nature and the spirit of humanistic care, and make a contribution to enhancing social harmony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is finding a personal mission helpful for sleep? I think there are two main points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a clear mission and goals can help people reduce confusion and perplexity, develop plans, take action, and continue to push forward, fully immersing themselves in it, thereby gaining inner peace and satisfaction. When faced with problems, they will also be more calm, not take insomnia too seriously, and anxiety and stress will be reduced, thereby improving sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having clear direction and goals can inspire individuals to develop a more disciplined lifestyle, such as adjusting their diet, exercising, managing their emotions, practicing and reading, and comprehensively improving their physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,sleep,"So I'm a college freshman with my earliest class being at 9 AM, but I like to wake up some hours earlier to try and get some time to read my bible and / or work out. In high school, this wasn't too much of a problem and I was able to keep things consistent. And then, after this semester started, I was able to continue that schedule pretty well.

All of a sudden, I'm oversleeping my alarms and not only end up not having time to do the things that I want to do, but also the things I need to do. It started worrying and bothering me when I'd finally get out of bed only 10 minutes before class started, only giving me time to put on some clothes, brew coffee to drink in class, and walk to class. This bothers me because I usually always start my mornings with a shower and some time to take care of my facial and oral hygiene.

Working out is gradually becoming a requirement for me, as my dad and I have recently started doing mini-marathons and spartan courses. 

I really need to start getting out of bed earlier, but it almost feels impossible at times. I haven't taken too drastic measures, but my methods of my sleep schedule mainly include taking 5g of melatonin and a small cup of water, and going to bed anywhere between 10 and 11. My first alarm starts at 6, giving me the recommended amount of at least 8 hours of sleep, and then multiple more alarms at 15 minute intervals. I also have an alarm on the other side of the room that acts as an artificial sunrise, but its rather ineffective.

To combat this, I plan on removing my blackout curtains to let in natural light as the sun rises, giving my internal clock a better wakeup call. I could also get some of those outlets that connect to my google home to connect to some bright lamps so that my room is illuminated indefinitely, rather than my sunrise alarm only being lit for 30 minutes and then turning itself off.

Here’s what worked for me:

* **Soft, slow-paced instrumental music** helps me relax without being too stimulating.
* I play music for **30 minutes** before bed to help signal my body it’s time to wind down.

,sleep,"BBC released a fascinating article that essentially states that the more you think about things like “I NEED 8hrs of sleep”, etc. the more you are likely to have worse sleep outcomes. It creates a vicious cycle when you get less sleep one night, you are anxious about the following night’s sleep. Sleep cues like watching the time become stressors. 

Similarly, the slew of sleep tracking devices we all use make us feel worse when they indicate we slept “poorly”.

I really resonate with this - I am such a stickler for sleep, especially since university ended and I got a 9-5 job. I even have trouble hanging out with friends late on a Friday night (e.g. it’ll mess up my sleep cycle and ruin my Saturday and I’ll be groggy all Sunday). I didn’t realize anything was wrong with my thought patterns until I read this article!

,sleep,"For about three months I’ve been struggling with sleep but in a really weird way. Every night, regardless of how tired I am, or how long I’d been up that day or how bored I am, something in me makes me want to just stay awake as long as possible but it makes no sense, like literally no part of me wants to be awake but it just feels out of my control. For whatever reason I always feel the need to stay awake until I physically cannot keep my eyes open. I don’t even have anything to be doing ever too- no shows I’m watching or video games or anything. The only way I can describe it is like when I consider going to sleep (again even if I’m exhausted and it’s 3am) it feels like there’s like a bratty child in my brain that just panics and is like nononono not bedtime! It just is so frustrating. There’s nothing for me and nothing for me to do like nobody I know is even awake at those hours too. It’s more than just wanting to stay up late it’s genuinely something that feels out of my control and I don’t know why. The worst part too is I have a weird anxiety about not getting enough sleep, which makes sense because sleep deprivation in the past has fucked me up bad but I don’t know it just makes it worse. I struggle a lot with my mental health so this isnt super crazy but it’s just the one thing I can’t get to the bottom of.

,sleep,"Hi All! This is not quite ""get better sleep"" related but I figured this was the best community to ask.

I'm looking for sleep headphones that will allow me to set up alarms that play audio tracks. I say ""audio tracks"" because I want to be able to use whatever audio I want whether it's a song, youtube video, etc. I'm fairly experienced so I can rip and convert the audio I want into whatever is needed. I don't need it automated, just possible.

Context: I have trouble getting my ass out of bed in the mornings. I want to wake up at 6am but I am routinely ignoring my wrist alarm and waking up at 7am. I could use my phone but a blaring horn alarm on my phone is not how I like to start my day nor my partner's (who doesn't want to wake up at 6am). So I want to try setting media alarms with music, poems, whatever, as a way to softly wake up.

I've done some research into sleep headphones but everything I've found either 1.) will shut off after I go to sleep and 2.) Doesn't set alarms at all or 3.) Only allows built-in media for alarms. I could look for ""normal"" headphones, but I'm looking into sleep ones as they are designed to be worn while sleeping &amp; I do plan to take advantage of sounds while sleeping as well.

Has anyone used or heard of a device that will allow me to schedule custom media alarms?

,sleep,"I am 18(M) and for the past 2 months or so I haven't been able to sleep properly. I can't fall asleep when I want to and I can't stay asleep when I do fall asleep. I usually go to bed around 10:30 pm every night and wake up at 7 am every morning with an alarm. Most of the time I struggle to fall asleep for a couple hours then wake up a 3-4 am not able to go back to sleep again. I am a pretty healthy teen, I workout 6 days a week from the times of 5 pm to 7 pm, usually calisthenics bodyweight training, I don't do much cardio. I eat healthy as well, no junk food, and mainly stick to homemade meals or restaurants that use organic, grass-fed ingredients. I tried to improve my circadian rhythm by not using any electronics during the first hour and last hour of the day, getting an hour of sunlight outside, and destressing before bed but none of that seems to help. To destress before bed I usually stretch for 5 minutes then try and read a book but I still can't fall asleep. Last night I just couldn't take it anymore, I went to bed at 10 pm to see if that was a difference but nope, still couldn't fall asleep. I laid with my eyes shut for 4 hours then was in light sleep for about 2 hours. My eyes opened at 4 am and I checked the clock and just started crying. I don't usually cry, apart from when I lost a loved one or broke my arm so it's pretty serious for me. I understand sleep is the number one most important thing for your health, and without it you will surely take years off your life and hairs off your head. I want to get more sleep but I really just can't find anything that helps. My mom says to meditate more and stop thinking before bed, but when I try to not think about thinking, I'm still thinking.

,sleep,"If you sleep in the same bed as someone and struggle with sleep — please read this, and then stop. 

I slept in the same bed as my partner for years, and never even thought twice about it. I also have struggled with sleep forever. About a year ago I slept in a separate bed on vacation (hotel accidentally gave us two queens), and it was such a good experience I decided to bring it home. Now we sleep (very happily) in separate beds each night and it's honestly the best thing ever. 

Why you should not sleep in the same bed: 

* Everyone has a slightly different optimal sleep set up, and you should be free to explore yours
* You are likely being disturbed many times throughout the night even if you don't realize it
* If you have different schedules, your wind down and wake up is being disturbed
* Fighting over sheets, temperature, lights, noise, etc is a waste of time and energy

How to sleep in different beds: 

* Set up a new room (if you have space)
* Swap your current bed for two smaller ones (you can still have a comforter that goes over both for aesthetic)
* Add a small twin bed somewhere else

Tips for the ""divorce"" conversation:

* Make sure they understand it's not about them, it's about you
* Be sure to reiterate it's something you want to do to be the best version of yourself
* Offer to lay with them before bed or in the mornings so it doesn't feel too isolating

This means I&amp;#39;m starting to wake myself up by smacking myself because my arms are almost completely numb and I&amp;#39;ve tried to move them. I evidently have enough movement in my shoulder to fling my arm up and then it comes down on my face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have dealt with long-term insomnia that I treat with melatonin.

,sleep,"Success story here. If you are struggling to fall/stay asleep, you NEED to watch the [Huberman Sleep Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2aWYjSA1Jc). I'm not kidding, watch the entire video right now. After average 2 hours a night of sleep over the past year, I've successfully slept for 8+ hours a night for TWO WEEKS STRAIGHT. You can stop reading here if you want, just watch that video and comprehend its entirety. I'll share my personal struggles below though.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I knew my sleep issues had to do with my circadian rhythm, but I had no clue how to properly set it. It's not because I had some health issue. It's not because I was stressed out or anything. I was simply just NEVER tired at night, no matter what I did. That is, until I watched the Huberman Sleep Toolkit podcast.

The following routine is MANDATORY for me to sleep well. If I go off this routine for more than 1 day, my sleep comes crashing down on me. It takes discipline, but its so worth it. I've never had this much energy in YEARS (and I'm literally a college student, not some oldhead).

* Direct sunlight into the eyes 30-60 minutes after waking up. Dont actually stare at the sun, just face towards it and tilt your head up a little. The podcast linked above shares the exact details for sunny vs cloudy days, etc.
* 20 minutes before sunset, I sit at my desk, which faces the sunset. I open the window, and read/do work/whatever until the sky is dark. This is to soak in the red light from the sun and signal my body that its time to sleep soon.
* Turn all my screens red and turn the brightness way down. (For Iphone, go to Settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;Display &amp; Text Size-&gt;Color Filters-&gt;select Color Tint and turn the Intensity and Hue ALL the way up) (For laptops: download f.lux and set the screen to 1200k).
* I turn on a dim lamp in my room so I can move around. The main goal is to view as LITTLE light as possible after sunset (opposite from the morning, where you need as much sun as possible to wake up).
* No eating/drinking 4 hours before I sleep, so I don't have to wake up in the middle of the night to pee.
* 1 hour before sleep, I take 200mg magnesium glycinate and 200mg of L-Theanine to relax
* 1 hour before sleep, I turn my room temperature down several degrees from what it was during the day
* 30 minutes before sleep, I take a hot shower to make my body's core temperature lower
* During sleep: wear ear plugs and a facemask to block out light

Obviously all of this stuff is discussed in greater depth in the Huberman podcast. That video helped me set my circadian rhythm so good and cleared any misconceptions I had about circadian rhythms and sleep. It honestly should be pinned to the top of this sub. Hope this helps someone.

However, I think this sentence is also very inspiring for many confused young people of today. Words such as' involution ',' lying flat ',' breaking defense ', and' swaying 'all showcase the cruelty and helplessness of reality. Nevertheless, we can still choose to embrace, warm, and transcend.

Once, I tossed and turned for over an hour without falling asleep due to insomnia. Suddenly, I remembered the phrase ""living deeply in a heartless world"". I changed it to ""breathing deeply in a heartless sleepless night"".

In some of my spare time I am able to continue to help individuals by writing articles that address a variety of issues around health and well-being. With my extensive knowledge and experience I try to provide effective advice and solutions for those seeking to improve their physical, mental and emotional well-being.

Most of the tips below will be fairly obvious to the members of this community but I though the list might be helpful in case one or two have slipped your mind.

1. **Stick to a Sleep Schedule:** Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock.  
2. **Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine:** Engage in calming activities before bed, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing meditation.  
3. **Limit Screen Time:** The blue light emitted from electronic devices can interfere with sleep. Avoid screens for at least an hour before bed.
4. **Watch Your Diet:** Avoid heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime. These can disrupt sleep.
5. **Exercise Regularly:** Physical activity can improve sleep quality. However, avoid intense workouts too close to bedtime.
6. **Create a Sleep-Conducive Environment:** Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Invest in comfortable bedding and pillows.
7. **Manage Stress:** Practice stress-reduction techniques like deep breathing, yoga, or mindfulness.
8. **Limit Naps:** Excessive napping can interfere with nighttime sleep. If you need to nap, keep it short and avoid napping late in the day.
9. **Seek Medical Advice:** If insomnia persists, consult a healthcare professional. They can rule out underlying medical conditions and recommend appropriate treatments.
10. **Avoid Sleep-Inducing Substances:** Over-reliance on sleep aids can lead to dependence. Consult a doctor before using them.

By incorporating these tips into your routine, you can improve your sleep quality and alleviate insomnia.

A few years ago I had an amazing pillow, and I’d like to buy another one if I can find what I had.

,sleep,"Sleep Series 538: What   can a sleep conditioning center bring you?

Last week, I went to the sleep conditioning center located at Building 20, No.11 Changqing Garden, Wuhan for several days of conditioning, and gained a lot from it.

Before conditioning, an evaluation was conducted, followed by three major processes. Firstly, high potential therapy is a green and healthy systemic therapy that focuses on promoting blood circulation, activating cells, and stabilizing the autonomic nervous system from the perspective of the body's self-healing and self-cleaning abilities, thereby achieving the goals of health preservation and improving sleep. The physical therapy process takes about half an hour, just lie in bed and comfortably enjoy the warm electric field ""soothing"" inside the cabin.

The second process is traditional Chinese medicine fumigation, where you lie on your back and then lie down in bed. During this time, you will sweat a lot, which helps you eliminate cold and dampness, toxins, promote blood circulation, remove blood stasis, relax tendons and meridians, relieve fatigue, and improve sleep.

Finally, there is meridian regulation, including massage, guasha, cupping, acupoint pointing, etc., which is carried out in stages for spleen and stomach regulation, liver and gallbladder regulation, heart and lung regulation, etc. After each regulation, people feel refreshed, transparent, relaxed and peaceful.

After a week of conditioning, my effective sleep time increased from 4-5 hours to 6-7 hours, and I gained a more comprehensive understanding of my sleep disorders, which is also helpful for future self-regulation.

In fact, I am just one of the many beneficiaries. Not only has it greatly improved the quality of sleep for many people, but it has also helped many teenagers and students overcome severe insomnia, school aversion, depression, and bipolar disorder, winning the deep praise of customers. This is a place where you can sleep better and dream more comfortably.

If you would like to learn more or experience it, please feel free to leave a message and communicate.

,sleep,"For over 10 years, I have been suffering from sleep issues. I sleep only a few hours, usually between 5 to 6 hours, and when I wake up, I feel tired, which negatively impacts my energy levels at work. Even if I manage to sleep for 7 hours, I often wake up multiple times, sometimes up to 6 times.

I have tried many solutions, including cutting out coffee for a while, but to no avail. I searched on YouTube and found some people talking about certain supplements, which I purchased, but they did not work either. In 2020, I heard about a sleep clinic and decided to go there. They told me I needed to spend the night for a sleep study. I spent the night connected to many wires, and they instructed me to sleep with just one pillow for more accurate testing.

After two hours, I woke up unable to breathe. They placed a breathing device on me, and I fell asleep again. When I woke up, I was surprised to find that I had slept for 6 continuous hours, which hadn’t happened in years. I felt like I had found the solution and that my problem was resolved. The doctor informed me that I needed to buy a CPAP machine.

I contacted the insurance company, which initially refused but later accepted, allowing me to purchase the device that cost about $1500, with a significant portion covered by the insurance.

After buying the machine, I took a 3-day leave from work, thinking that this time would be dedicated to sleeping since I needed to compensate for years of lost sleep. However, on the first day, I was shocked to face the same old problem. I tried again the next day, but unfortunately, the result was the same. I called the doctor, who said I needed time to get used to the mask and the machine.

After a month of use, I still hadn’t noticed any improvement. The doctor adjusted the air flow settings, suggesting it might help, but unfortunately, I didn’t see any difference. A year later, I returned to the clinic, and they changed the machine, but the situation remained the same. I thought it might be the type of mask, so I bought a new one, but to no avail. In the end, I stopped using the device and decided to live with the problem.

During this period, my British friend reached out to me, saying he was experiencing the same issue. He visited a doctor and bought a device that he claimed worked for him. He lent me his machine to try, but unfortunately, it didn’t benefit me either. I was puzzled as to why I benefited in the hospital but not at home. I even began to suspect that the hospital might have used a sedative to help me sleep, convincing me that the device was the reason for my improved sleep, so I would buy it from them.

Throughout this time, I continued searching for solutions. I purchased products like nasal strips and mouth-closure strips to help me breathe through my nose while sleeping, and I even bought blue light-blocking glasses, but they were of no benefit. I spoke with a therapist, thinking she might assist me in dealing with stress, and she provided me with exercises like breathing before bed and focusing on positive thoughts, which helped slightly but soon wore off.

I also received advice about keeping a journal before sleep, but its effect was minimal and faded over time. I have spent over $2000 on vitamins, supplements, devices, and therapy, all without success.

Even when I was around 5-6 I would remember being awake while the rest of my family was asleep and I would watch all the shows that would play late at night. The worst its ever been was around age 12-14 where I would literally sleep until 4pm some days, but I haven't done that in years. 

I literally cannot seem to go to sleep any earlier than 11pm. My bedtime right now is around 2:30-3am, which makes me wake up later at around 11-12. But sometimes I am prone to oversleeping, alot.

I don't know what to do. I've tried melatonin for years and it has no affect on me.

,sleep,"Hello! My 9-year old son recently had a sleep study to screen for sleep apnea and daytime fatigue. While the study didn’t find high AHI, the diagnosis was mild sleep related hypoventilation / hypoxemia. I am including the full study results below. Does anyone have any experience with this condition or advice? Thanks in advance!

Indications for Polysomnography: The patient is a 9 year old Male. A full night polysomnogram was performed to evaluate for suspected obstructive sleep apnea. 

Overview: Obstructive Apnea Hypopnea Index: 0.3 /hour Central Apnea Index: 1.6 /hour Saturation nadir: 96.0% Sleep time spent &lt;90% oxygen saturation: 0.0 minutes (0.0%). Time spent with CO2 above 50 mmHg: minutes (29.2%). Polysomnogram Data Polysomnography was performed in a darkened room with the patient sleeping in a comfortable bed. Standard polysomnography consisted of: EEG (C3M2 / C4M1 / O1M2 / F3M2); EMG (submental and tibial); EOG (right/left); ECG; SaO2, end-tidal CO2, oximeter pulse wave form, and audio and video recording. Airflow was monitored with a nasal cannula attached to a pressure transducer and a thermistor. Respiratory effort was assessed with thoracic and abdominal inductive plethysmography. Identification and scoring of sleep stages, arousals and respiratory events was performed in accordance with The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. Sleep Architecture The total recording time of the polysomnogram was 440.5 minutes. The total sleep time was 381.5 minutes.

 The patient spent 5.5% of total sleep time in Stage N1, 48.0% in Stage N2, 32.8% in Stages N3, and 13.8% in REM. REM time is decreased. Sleep latency was 29.8 minutes. REM latency was 173.5 minutes. Sleep Efficiency was normal at 86.6%. Wake after sleep onset was 29.5 minutes. The arousal index was normal at 10.5/hour. Respiratory Events The polysomnogram was remarkable for - obstructive, 10 central, and - mixed apneas resulting in a Total Apnea index of 1.6 events per hour. There were 2 hypopneas resulting in a Total Hypopnea index of 0.3 events per hour. The combined Apnea/Hypopnea index was 1.9 events per hour, with an Obstructive Apnea Hypopnea Index (OAHI) of 0.3 events per hour and Central Apnea Index (CAI) of 1.6 events per hour. The AHI during REM sleep was 4.6/hour. 

Snoring was not reported by the technician. Mean oxygen saturation was 98.5%. The lowest oxygen saturation during sleep was 96.0%. Sleep time spent &lt;90% oxygen saturation was - minutes (-).

Mean End Tidal CO2 during sleep was 48.0 mmHg, with a peak of 57.3 mmHg, and time spent above 50 mmHg was 111.4 minutes (29.2%). 

Limb Activity There were 11 limb movements recorded. Of this total, - were classified as PLMs Cardiac Summary The average pulse rate was 62.5 bpm. The minimum pulse rate was 47.0 bpm while the maximum pulse rate was 112.0 bpm.

Diagnosis: The patient has mild sleep related hypoventilation of unclear etiology. Partial upper airway obstruction (obstructive hypoventilation) is possible but seems less likely given the fact that the patient did not snore and obvious upper airway obstruction was not seen in study tracings. Underlying lung disease is possible, clinical correlation is needed. Sleep related hypoventilation / hypoxemia (ICD-10: G47.36) Abnormalities may be underestimated as REM time was decreased.

Normally it’s a bit normal if I can’t sleep when they’re still kicked in. At some point though I’d fall asleep or I’d take a dph pill to sleep. Like last week it was one of those times and I couldn’t fall asleep. Everytime I tried even tho I was tired enough to sleep, I’d have a muscle spasm away. Like I noticed it was hard to actually fall asleep cause it almost felt like my body would slight move a body part on its own when it detected I was about to fall asleep. Thats one part of what happened. But then there are parts where I’d actually try to hold still and fall asleep and when I did that idk if I experience a Hypnic jerk  but my whole body shakes/has a muscle spasm awake. When this happened I got scared each time and felt my heart racing bc this was scaring me. It happened continuously. Until I gave up and just decided to take dph which finally allowed me to fall asleep with no symptoms. But now this happens every night. I called my doc but my appointment to seee my primary care is in 2 weeks and I’m gonna have him refer me to a get a sleep study done to maybe diagnose sleep apnea. But that’s gonna take even longer. I’ve been using dph nightly to get to sleep but idk what happening. I’m panicking a bit rn cause I literally don’t think I can possibly sleep without it . I think I’m gonna lose my sanity.

,sleep,"So I’m going on here because I have no other options, I have had hypersalivation for the last three months and its driven me crazy. Here’s some context, I am a 20-year-old male who exercises almost daily, I don’t drink soda or much processed food. I’m generally a pretty healthy, happy, and chill guy, but this hypersalivation has truly ruined my life completely. It has caused severe stress and anxiety, and it just downright makes me dread waking up in the morning. So it all started when I woke up one day and went to take grandma to the airport and I felt like I couldn’t really talk and my mouth felt weird (I just attributed it to having had woken up early) so I threw in some gum and went about my day, then later that night as I’m chilling on the coach watching a movie I realized my mouth was just filling up incredibly rapidly and I was just confused and then I realized I was hypersalivating for no apparent reason and its been that way since then not stop 24/7 365. I just want to find the cause of my hypersalivation so I can fix it and go about my life again.

My symptoms feel like my mouth just fill right up with water (spit but very serous spit) and If I swallow it’ll just fill right back up again, and when I spit it out it’ll just be very watery spit but I can basically keep spitting into infinity because the production never stops

I have been to 3 ENT doctors who all said everything looked good and I’m in the process of getting a CT scan done on my salivary glands.

I have been to 2 GI doctors who said everything looked good and I got an endoscopy done and all good

I have been to 3 General Doctors who said everything was all good and got blood and urine tests done which also came back perfect

My ideas of Potential causes of hypersalivation are:

-Prior to getting this hypersalivation I water fasted for three full days in which I was chewing gum all day. Somewhere throughout that whole process maybe my parasympathetic system, which controls salivary production got jacked up by something I did and it hasn’t been able to return to its normal state

-The same day the hypersalivation started I also got a tattoo in the upper middle chest that extends to the traps, maybe it caused some nerve damage or affected my nervous system, but I am fairly certain that the hypersalivation started when I woke up and the tattoo was around 2pm

-I do have a very minor overbite and some crowding in my front bottom teeth but overall pretty good teeth and oral hygiene, I did have a dental procedure done about three weeks before the hypersalivation started where apparently I just had a dent in one of my molar and they just did a simple filling on it, but I had no issues the three weeks prior

-I sleep on my stomach/side, not sure if that means anything

-I developed scalloped tongue from the hypersalivation because I have a tendency to move the tongue in a place where it shouldn’t go to try to minimize the rapid accumulation or saliva, also not sure if that means anything either

With all this being said I have no idea what’s wrong with me and the doctors don’t know what’s wrong with me. No, it’s not all in my head. If you saw the shear amounts of saliva, I’m spitting out you’d be surprised. And no, it’s not an anxiety symptom, as yes, this has caused me a great deal of anxiety, but there’s a good chance I went my whole entire life without feeling anxiety before this started, as I’m just not really a anxious guy whatsoever.

,sleep,"Sleep Series 536: Whom do you want to exchange souls with in your dreams?

The movie ""Your Name"" tells a series of stories about a high school girl named Miyamizu Mitsuha who lives in the countryside and a high school boy named Tachibana Taki who lives in Tokyo. They exchange bodies in their dreams because they long for each other's lives.

Exchanging the body, of course, also exchanges the soul. One theory suggests that when a person dreams, the quantum system of the brain may be in a state of superposition of multiple universes (and the determined consciousness upon waking up is equivalent to the collapse of the superposition state), so in a dream, you may enter the timeline of other parallel universes to interact with others, and even infiltrate others' bodies, just like Mitsuba and Taki.

Who do you want to exchange souls with in your dream? You can also, like Mitsuba and Taki, constantly pray and suggest the life you want through visual imagination and words. Perhaps one day in your dream, you will truly become the person you hope to exchange souls with and experience her/his life.

In addition, this soul swapping game can also be used to help with sleep. One night, I had difficulty falling asleep, so I imagined myself swapping souls with Zhu Bajie while half asleep and half awake. During the day, I did a lot of miscellaneous work for Zhu Bajie, and at night, I was lazy and sleepy like Zhu Bajie, lying on the ground and soon sleeping soundly. This imagination really made me fall asleep earlier.

,sleep,"Hi everyone, I’ve been experiencing sleep paralysis for most of my life—probably around 1,000 episodes so far. Over time, I believe my brain has adapted in a way that allows me to control certain physical responses during these episodes, and I wanted to share my experience to see if anyone else has encountered something similar or has insights.

Here’s what happens:

	•	I’m fully aware that I’m in a sleep paralysis state almost instantly. I usually get it when I try to fall asleep, in other cases I’ve heard people get it when they wake up, I think my case is super unique! 
	•	I can fully open my eyes and keep them open during the episode.
	•	I can control violent shaking—essentially, I squeeze all my muscles and start shaking intensely, as if it’s my body’s defense mechanism against the paralysis. It is so strange and I’ve never heard anyone else being able to do this, my whole body shakes every time I squeeze. 
	•	While I can’t move large parts of my body, I have control over small muscle movements like fingers and toes which have been reported by some but not many.

I think my brain has developed neural pathways or coping mechanisms to escape sleep paralysis because it happens so frequently. The violent shaking seems to be my body’s way of trying to break free from the paralysis, almost like a programmed reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any feedback or thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;

Recently its taken a turn for the worse, over summer vacation ive just been going to sleep later and later until ive only been able to go to sleep around 6am - 8am.

Ive completely adjusted my cleaning/living schedule to accommodate my new sleeping schedule. During my waking hours im fully rested and energized.

With upcoming lifestyle changes such as Uni and a part time job im worried I wont reset quick enough.

Relaxing Teas and meditation never really worked, im pretty sure I have undiagnosed adhd so i cant just lay my head down on a pillow for an hour and hope my brain shuts off, and melatonin supplements give me weird nightmares where I wake up out of my sleep scared, delusional and sweaty.

Ive tried exhausting myself in my waking hours in hopes of passing out at a reasonable time (10pm). But I’ll go to sleep, wake up (11am) and stay awake until 5am all over again. Ill lay my head on the pillow, but it just wont happen.

,sleep,"sorry long post ahead :’)
tldr: been waking up 3 times a night and not being able to stay asleep past 7-8am, even when sleeping at 1-2am and hence only sleeping 4-5 hours. tried addressing issues with light, noise and heat but nothing is working. i usually have no problems with falling asleep, but staying asleep is the problem. 

i moved to singapore 2 months ago and ever since moving here i’ve had problems with sleeping. it started off with me waking up at 7-8am, despite sleeping around 1-2am every night. at first i thought it was because of the light, so i invested in some blockout curtains and sleep with an eye mask. however, for the past 3 weeks, i’ve started waking up in the middle of the night at least 2-3 times EVERY night, even when it’s dark - so i don’t think the light is the main problem here 

noise is another factor that i suspect is affecting me too. i’m living in a shared apartment with other students and becuase it’s kind of old, the doors are pretty low quality in terms of soundproofing and you need to close the door with lots of pressure to fully close it. my room is also next to the bathroom, which also makes a loud and shape noise when closing. i’ve just bought some earplugs that i’ll try tonight but i’m honestly not sure how much this will really help. 

i’ve always been a light sleeper so i do suspect that all of these factors (noise, light and the humidity) are combining to affect my sleep. however i just want to understand why everyday for the past 3 weeks i’ve been waking up throughout the night at like 2am, 4am, etc. without a proper explanation 🥲 ive also tried chamomile tea, magnesium pills, etc. but i don’t think those have been helping at all. 

another thing is that becuase of my sleep deprivation now (been sleeping 4-5 hours every night, 6 on a good night), my heartbeat tends to “pound” when im waking up in the morning. i’ve tried seeing doctors about this issue and they’ve prescribed me with some anxiety pills, but honestly i haven’t found that they’ve helped that much. 

is there anything else i can do at this point? 🥲 i’ve been recommended some gamma oryzanol pills which im currently waiting to arrive, since i was told that can help as a sleep aid. but at this point, i’m starting to lose hope that anything will be able to help me at all. as a student, its really starting to affect my mental wellbeing and motivation since nothing is working and my sleep quality is just getting worse and worse 😭 also i know this is probably kind of stubborn of me, but i don’t want to rely on sleeping pills. 

i know that it’s probably best for me to see a sleep doctor about this issue (i’ve only been seeing GP’s), but was just wondering if anyone else has been through this and i would appreciate any advice i could get. thanks!!

I'm doing a little research and hoping for feedback for a idea I've had.

It's an alarm clock that has a smart sensor that can tell when you get up from bed. Meaning, you cannot snooze it and the only way to stop it is to actually get up. It also has sun light (simulates sun), and good quality speakers that play calm music/sounds. 

The idea is to have a great morning without little heart attacks and 5 snoozes.

Do you think this is something you would enjoy?

,sleep,"I (f27) stay at my boyfriend’s (25m) house for most of the week, maybe 3 or 4 days. Sometimes in a row and sometimes space in between, but for the most part it’s a few days. I usually go home the night before I have to work. I am an emt at my town fire department and I work 18 hour shifts from 6am to 12am for 2-3 days a week. I have to be up at 5am and it affects my sleep schedule for the rest of the week. Especially now that we/i have established routines. 

When we first got together tho I was on drugs (for about 4 years. And at my worst I was taking about 80mg of Percocet a day, drinking heavy all the time). I was severely depressed (have been since about 12 years old. I’ve tried medication and raw dogging. I feel like I dont need medication at this point because I can feel that I am no where near as depressed as I’ve been my whole life basically. I feel like I have air and light around me now if that makes sense. I have healthy coping mechanisms now, I’m in therapy, have access to recovery services, and for the first time In My life I have real motivation to get better and never get as low as I was before. With all that being said, I do think I have a personality disorder of some sort. Maybe bpd). I also had 2 ems jobs when we first got together, with me working about 60 hours a week and having 24 hour shifts sometimes. 

I say all that to say this: because I am no longer living a volatile and inconsistent lifestyle and have established routines and more healthy living habits, I get sleepy wayyyyy earlier now. I was able to stay up for 48 hours at a time when I was at my worst. But now I’m exhausted at 10pm. Especially when I’m at my bf’s house. But I also notice when I’m at home I’m able to stay awake longer. Maybe until 2/3/4am. But I’m at my home in my own space where I can do whatever i want, whenever I want and I can’t do that at his house (he lives in the basement alone but his mother and younger brother are upstairs, I also live with my parents and younger sister). When I’m home I can just feel myself not be tired and I think that’s because I’m alone and get to do whatever I please in the comfort of my own space vs when I’m at his house and we do whatever we can there due to the limitations . Whether that be video games, movies, watching sports, etc. the dilemma is that we are In the bed and in the dark or cuddled up for these activities. Sometimes I hit a wall or I get comfy or I can’t lie, I’ll be a little bored and I become soooooo exausted. He and I both suggest walks or going skating or taking a drive to wake me up but when we come back from these activities, I literally still cannot fight through. He says that he feels abandoned and that I have no willpower because I cannot stay awake or I won’t wake up to my alarms. He says he feels I value the sleep more than quality time with him. He doesn’t like sitting next to a sleeping corpse because that is not hanging out or quality time. He wants to spend time with me and not my sleeping body. AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND HIM AND AGREE. 

And I’ve been trying so hard to find ways to stay awake. I’ve bought all kinds of energy drinks but they shred my stomach and give me reflux. I’ve taken up walking and exercising, started taking Vitamins and supplements, started eating better, started losing weight. All kinds of stuff to try and find a little bit more energy at the end of the day. Sometimes I’ll try to nap, but it’ll be at the end of the day around 9/10 pm when I get sleepy and it turns into real slumber because I cant wake up out of it. Somwtimes I can find a second wind and sometimes I physically cannot. I’m also a very heavy sleeper and I cancel the alarms in my sleep and he says that I’m mean to him when he tries to wake me up but I don’t remember this. This causes the cycle to repeat the next day because now I wake up at like 7 am and he wakes up at 11 because he has gone to sleep later than me. So we’re already starting off the day on Different schedules and I know I’m going to get tired sooner than him. 

We had an argument today where he said that it is the only unattractive part of me and it aggravates him that I can’t stay awake and I’m like an old woman. I have told him what was different from the time we started dating to now. I keep telling him that I’m trying and I am but he says that I’m giving him empty promises because it’s happened a couple more times again over the last few months since we had a conversation about me falling asleep. He gave me an ultimatum to fix the sleepiness or he’s going to break up with me. We both are looking at our relationship for long term so I’m taking the ultimatum seriously. I told him that I was going home for a couple of days to try to regulate my schedule to allow me to stay up later and he said that I shouldnt have to do that and I’m messing up the weekend plans he had for us.

after more than 10 years, I got myself a new mattress. It feels much firmer than the old one, and I'm having issues -- Every day I slept on it so far, I wake up with stiff, achy neck that I have to slowly stretch during the day.

Now, I also have epilepsy, so good sleep is sorta essential for me, and just today, I got a seizure in the morning that I put down on the sleep issues from the new mattress.

The question I Have is -- Having had a pretty soft mattress so far, is it just taking my body some some time to adjust? Will the soreness eventually disappear? Or should I consider getting different, softer, mattress? 

Also, I'm about 107kg and 189 cm, don't know how much that matters when chosing a mattress.

When you can't sleep at night, imagine yourself on a vast grassland far away from the city, comfortably lying on a lounge chair and enjoying the night sky. The night sky is as dark as ink, with stars twinkling. Suddenly, a shooting star cuts through the sky, and then countless rays of light pour out like the Milky Way, as if a messenger sent by a distant galaxy, carrying mysterious and beautiful light, crossing from the depths of the universe to Earth.

Meteors shoot out from all directions, creating brilliant arcs in the darkness. Occasionally, several shooting stars fall at the same time, like fireworks blooming in the sky, illuminating the entire night sky and making people feel awe inspiring. You devoutly make one sweet and beautiful wish after another and warm blessings... Mysterious, romantic, delightful, transcendent, relieved, and relaxed, all these ecstatic feelings make you forget yourself and gradually fall asleep in ecstasy.

,sleep,"I've had troubles sleeping for as long as I can remember. Started at 4yrs old with nightmares after my parents got divorced. When I was 19, I was confronted with severe hyperventilation for the first time and this was a constant factor during my twenties. It's gotten better with therapies but it remained to be my weak spot and so breathing has always been 'a thing' for me.   
  
Fast forward to current times (45 yrs old), I'm having troubles with waking myself up multiple times during the night, especially during the deep sleep phase (first hours of the night). Lately, it has gotten to a point where I fall asleep easily but keep getting shock reactions where it seems my breath is choking. I have been checked for apnea but that's not the diagnosis as it goes away later in the night (REM phase). 

It also differs per night or week. I have weeks where I can sleep in easily without these shocks but then get a major one around 3 hours into my sleep. So bad that I really think I'm choking/dying and fly out of bed, often accompanied by screams. 

It's really f-ing up my days as I often feel dizzy and tired and the only thing that can take that away is a good night's sleep which obviously isn't a certainty in my case. I have read about night terrors etc and see some similarities but it's just not really that. Have been in therapy before to talk about the past, divorce of my parents and all the struggles that came with it but I'm in a good place with that. As in, it's not haunting me in dreams or whatever. 

I've had my heart function checked out before, as I do have palpitations sometimes (my dad does too and needs surgery for it soon). Verdict was that I'm healthy and fit (I do exercise frequently, maintain a healthy BMI, do breathing exercises, very easy on alcohol, I do eat too much sugar though). But I just feel there's something physically wrong. It's like an internal lightning strike that gives my body a shock and wakes me up, grasping for air.

,sleep,"i'm well aware i have some kind of sleeping disorder and it may be related to ADHD (I live in the UK, and getting a diagnosis is very long and difficult). I'm prescribed melatonin to help me sleep at night but I find it to be hit or miss no matter how much I take. 

More recently, i've found myself sleeping at about 1am till about 1pm. I'm not tired when I do this, and i'm not tired when I don't - and that's just the confusing part. If i get 4 hours of sleep and wake up at 7am, I still won't get an early night the next morning. I just won't fall asleep until well after midnight even if i lay there trying. if I get 12 hours of sleep and wake up at 1pm, I'll fall asleep anywhree from 1-3am, sometimes later. I *can't* wake up in mornings unless i physically *have* to. I'm a student with lectures in afternoons and no actual obligation to be on campus in mornings, so it's up to me to get up. 

I have multiple alarm apps - Sleep Cycle, which I've used for years, and is supposed to identify where you are in your sleep cycle to wake you up at the best time, but the alarm turns off when the phone is even moved, so it's completely ineffective and I only use it to track my sleep. I also use Alarmy, and do anything from math problems, memory games, barcode scanning, etc etc. None of it works. Even just this morning, someone rang my doorbell at 10:30, I answered the door, they left, and I went straight back to sleep until 1:30pm. I can't stop myself from doing this.

I&amp;#39;m prescribed melatonin to help me sleep at night but I find it to be hit or miss no matter how much I take. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, i&amp;#39;ve found myself sleeping at about 1am till about 1pm. I&amp;#39;m not tired when I do this, and i&amp;#39;m not tired when I don&amp;#39;t - and that&amp;#39;s just the confusing part. If i get 4 hours of sleep and wake up at 7am, I still won&amp;#39;t get an early night the next morning. I just won&amp;#39;t fall asleep until well after midnight even if i lay there trying. if I get 12 hours of sleep and wake up at 1pm, I&amp;#39;ll fall asleep anywhree from 1-3am, sometimes later. I &lt;em&gt;can&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; wake up in mornings unless i physically &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to. I&amp;#39;m a student with lectures in afternoons and no actual obligation to be on campus in mornings, so it&amp;#39;s up to me to get up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have multiple alarm apps - Sleep Cycle, which I&amp;#39;ve used for years, and is supposed to identify where you are in your sleep cycle to wake you up at the best time, but the alarm turns off when the phone is even moved, so it&amp;#39;s completely ineffective and I only use it to track my sleep. I also use Alarmy, and do anything from math problems, memory games, barcode scanning, etc etc. None of it works. Even just this morning, someone rang my doorbell at 10:30, I answered the door, they left, and I went straight back to sleep until 1:30pm. I can&amp;#39;t stop myself from doing this. I&amp;#39;m not depressed (to my knowledge), and I&amp;#39;m not really &lt;em&gt;tired&lt;/em&gt; when I go back to sleep. I just choose not to be awake.&lt;/p&gt;

,sleep,"Hey r/sleep ! 

Yes, I am in the right sub lol. I'm a 22 year old man, and am in the beginning stages of one of my first genuine relationships; however, there is one annoyance which I'm having trouble getting past. 

When I was younger, all my relationships were very casual. So, at the very most, I'd spend the occasional night sleeping overnight with a woman. Now that I have a girlfriend, however, she wants me to sleep at her house often and her at my house. 

The trouble is that I'm a very sensitive sleeper. I sleep with earplugs in and the fan running year round, as I tend to get hot very easily in the night. It takes me about 30 minutes to fall asleep on average, and I just can't seem to fall asleep while cuddling with her. And if I wake up in the middle of the night and she's climbed onto me, I can't fall back asleep to save my life. It's such an annoyance that I often don't even want her to sleep over as I know I'm gonna get a poor sleep because of it. Is there any practical way to tackle this? Or should I just tell her we need to stay apart when sleeping? I'd like to be able to become a more (dynamic? Lol I can't find the descriptive term) sleeper, but I find it hard to change my sleep habits. I'm also very easily effected by not sleeping atleast 7 hours. 

I'm curious if anyone has ever had this problem, and if they have any tips for me. Thanks in advance!

So two days ago I was listening to music when trying to fall asleep, i had taken like 16g of melatonin (the dosage i normally take every other night bc i have an early morning). This one song came on, which i've listend too a pretty good amount and i mean it's a really good song and brings back good memories but never to the point of making me emotional or anything. But my whole body just started tingling, like i was being kissed or something. It felt like i was dreaming. But then like 2 minutes into the song i tried to move my arm and the sensation went away like instantly, but i still felt almost high in my head and noticed my eyes had teared up.

I tried to replicate the same exact routine last night and nothing happened, so i just went to bed like normal.

,sleep,"Hi,

I've been always struggling with my morning routine. I always wake up feeling sluggish and, despite never snoozing my alarm even once, I need a long time to get up and become an actually functional human being.
Lately I felt a bit more adventurous and came up with a wake-up ""strategy"" that I would like your feedback on. The idea is to:

1. Set an alarm for 45-60 minutes before you actually need to wake up
2. When it goes off, quickly take a caffeine pill, no need to even open my eyes. (I've been using them already throughout the day for a time, but I normally wake up with an actual espresso cup which I prepare and then get back in bed to consume).
3. Immediately get back to sleep
4. Wake up naturally and potentially more gently as the caffeine kicks in
5. Get up and have my breakfast complete with the actual espresso cup 

Has anyone tried something like this? Is there any downside that I am not considering, especially long term?

Their unwavering dedication often leaves them feeling burnt out and depleted. Yet, when they get into bed longing for a good nights sleep, their mind would be racing and they find impossible to get to sleep.

If you can relate to any of the statement below, you could be suffering from Insomnia.

* Find it hard to go to sleep
* Wake up several times during the night
* Lie awake at night
* Wake up early and cannot go back to sleep
* Still feel tired after waking up
* Find it hard to nap during the day even though you're tired
* Feel tired and irritable during the day
* Find it difficult to concentrate during the day because you're tired

If you have insomnia for a short time (less than 3 months) it's called short-term insomnia. Insomnia that lasts 3 months or longer is called long-term insomnia.

As I mentioned, I have now retired from practice so in my spare time, I write articles on topics related to mental wellness.

If you are interested in exploring Self-Hypnosis as a possible solution for your sleep issues, I have written an in depth article about how it works and how you can teach yourself to use it. I'll put a link below. I'll also put a link to a very short Pre recorded Hypnosis session for you to try.

When I fall asleep I have no spasms or anything at all, not even a shaky leg. But when I am asleep and I come to my REM or deep sleep cycle I starting to getting strong spasm from the neck to the arms.

Only what helped my until now was magnesium and especially vitamin b complex, when I don´t take it everything worsens so much. I am to think that I will starting try CBD soon.

I did have to stop to take caffeine, in form of coffee or diet coke etc., because also little doses worsened my sleep and my symptoms. Was hard but good because I was really addicted to caffeine over the years and took too much.

I just woke up from the dream, sorry if my wording is sloppy; I’m tired and can’t fall back asleep.

(Other notes: I have two dogs, I don’t have any male friends, IRL my grandpa is alive)

In the dream I was walking my white dog, down the street like I usually did, not bothering anyone or anything. Eventually I realized that the street was mirrored/flippped, like that one race in Mario kart. There was a gang of maybe 6-7 black teen dudes (their skin is important), who all looked at me then started following me. Obviously I ran, getting home then realizing I wasn’t really getting chased. Maybe I imagined their existence?
I got home and went to my room, my little dog (black) was already in my room, which was beyond abnormal, she’d never be there, she’d follow me in and then ask to be on my bed, but wouldn’t just *be there*. She didn’t have that sweet in her eye either, she looked mischievous and bitchy almost, laughing maybe. I tried picking her up then the bitch spoke (I’m not even kidding it sounded like every voice interpretation of Satan mixed together, and worse) telling me I didn’t deserve my animals, and to bring him food like a burger so he’d leave. 
I agreed and went to go downstairs to get in the freezer, yet stopped as I looked over and saw just a crepid doll peeking over, the bitch snapping its head towards me. One thing I will never do is dolls. EVER. I then got maybe three foot shorter, another doll poking up, then another, then another. I didn’t count them but there had to be at least 12 or 14.

Now I knew I was stuck. Can’t go into my room, there’s the demon dog in there. Can’t do downstairs, it’s creepy plus there’s like 15 demon dolls; WE DONT HAVE ANY DOLLS IN THE HOUSE. AT ALL.

I didn’t care, sat down in her piss and held her, called my mom- she was on the toilet shitting. So I call the cops, they’re not willing to listen either.

I started speaking about something “you need to come over” cause I yelled “over”, my mom knocking on the wall to tell me I was being loud, my dog waking up from her sleep.

This without a doubt is affecting my sleep and energy throughout the day but I think there's more to the picture.

Is it wise to do this before seeing a sleep doctor and getting a sleep study? I won't be able to compare the before and after results.

I think I also have a tendency to wake up to go to the bathroom. I try to not drink anything close to bedtime but sometimes I forget to drink something 3 hrs before and I just don't have another option. I also think I have a small bladder since I'm somewhat thin despite eating a lot. It also doesn't help I live alone so I don't have anyone to remind me to stop snacking or drinking before bed.

I also sometimes just get too energized before bedtime sometimes despite being also tired. For many years I was sleeping during the day and awake at night so I think it permanently prevented me from having a normal sleep schedule which I HAVE to get back to for work. I think ultimately I'll need to be on some kind of sleep medicine like Lunesta to get me to sleep and to stay asleep but then I'm worried about my bladder bursting if I drink too much water right before bed. But then I'm worried about those drugs and feeling tired when I wake up from their side effects despite getting a full sleep. Maybe I can take them just for a couple months just to get back on a normal sleep schedule then get off them?

I've stopped energy drinks and alcohol completely and have tried to stop coffee and just drink tea. Sometimes I'll have just a small coffee during the day but I feel like even just that will last all the way to night and keep me awake sometimes but if I don't drink it then I won't have enough energy throughout the day on days where I didn't get good sleep.

What doctors will I have to see to fix this besides the ent I'm already seeing? A somnologist? A neurologist? A psychiatrist? Can I just see one? I'm already seeing too many doctors.

Can a somnologist prescribe sleep medicine like Lunesta without needing a psychiatrist?

I don't know if my ins will even cover a sleep study or a psychiatrist, we were surprised to even find out it'll cover the majority of the septoplasty.

I've been meaning to record myself sleeping but I forget every night. I might do it tonight and see how it looks.

This usually happens when I only get about 1.5 hours of sleep, and it lasts for 4-5 minutes each time.

In the back of my mind, I know it doesn’t really make sense, but I can’t pinpoint what’s wrong because I genuinely believe most of the memories.

Then, slowly, my real memories start to come back. Sometimes I’ll be in a mixed state where I remember who I am (maybe about 50%) but still strongly believe that everyone can use magic in the real world. Once, I even tried to use magic in my room!

It’s like having a cup full of oil (the fake memories) that slowly gets replaced with water (the real memories), pushing the oil out of the cup.

,sleep,"For about 8 months I was never tired when I wanted to be and always sleepy when I wanted to be awake. I stayed up routinely until 3 or 4 AM only to wake up again at 8. I couldn't string together 8 straight hours to save my life. lol Then I shifted from getting super tired at 5 or 6pm only to wake up at 11pm. UGH Staying up all night sucked but a part of me really liked it because I can self entertain like no other. I tried various strategies that worked for me in the past like trying to stay up all night because surely the more exhausted I was the more I'd sleep, right? NOPE 3 to 4 hours max. every 12 to 16 hours. Not good. I looked physically tired and wasn't thinking well. I even tried sleeping whenever I could which lead me to oversleep most of the day and miss out on pretty much everything.

So after 6 or so months of this. (IDK why it took me so long) But I started researching again true to my nature in general. I even got a masterclass subscription which had a course on sleep as well. All te research I found neglected what I feel are 2 most important components.  Your minerals and your sleep diet.

The first thing I tried was Magnesium. From working at my float center years back I remembered that the best way to get magnesium was through the skin. So I made myself a squeeze bottle of epsom salt water and started spraying it on my legs and feet. I didn't notice anything for a few days but at least there were improvements although intermittent.

Long story short about Magnesium is that it was caffeine that depletes it. It's why people feel like coffee dehydrates them. It doesn't dehydrate you but it causes cramps just the same by making your liver use your magnesium to clear the caffeine. So I kissed that amazing wonderful and well missed drink good bye.

Boom! The effects were great I started getting that awesome feeling when going to sleep.

This helped when I got to sleep but it was getting to sleep that was messing with me the most. Just wired and tired. Not enough energy to be productive and too alert to sleep. DAMN IT back to the drawing board. So I researched other nutrients involved in sleep.

Here they are and what they do:

Vitamin D and light discipline keeps your circadian rythmes in line. Get sunlight early in the morning. Turn off your lights at sundown. If you can afford to get red lights or something to simulate candles that works best. Get a f.lux to block the blue light from your screen.

Zinc: Building up your zinc stores with nuts, and supplements. I was taking 600% in a few supplements a day because zinc deficiency made sense. Take it with vitamin C though!

Iron: Oxygen baby! More oxygen = better sleep. Why do you think we breath like we do when sleeping? It's maximally efficient!

Magnesium: Of course my favorite since it's so cheap and easy to just spray and go.

The finaly piece was the mental state when falling asleep. Thoughts can be divided into 2 sections largely. Task oriented thoughts and experiential/ mind wandering thoughts. If your mind is overwhelmed with thoughts about your plans tomorrow the best thing I know how to do is write them down. But make sure when you wake up you refer to them AND execute on what was bothering you the most. You'll begin to trust yourself and your mind will start leaving you alone once you build this habit but that's a whole other post for sure.

If you're past that one what I like to do is relax each part of my body from toe to head and only focus on my eyes and the little red and black dots that flicker around. Boom I'm out

Last but not least is sleep debt:
About 4 hours after you wake up there's a dip in energy. The more sleep deprived you are the more severe this feels and the more pressure there is to sleep. This has nothing to do with your food. This happens ON TOP OF what youre body does with the food you eat. Some foods will make you tired and others will pep you up. Most of us like I did would reach for the 2nd cup of coffee. I'm telling you, please nap. If you wake up early enough say 7 or 8am you can nap at noon and be fine to sleep again at night when your 2nd energy dip will occur. The duration you'll need will lower the more you do it. For me a 2 hour nap was a godsend when I was only getting a few each night. As time went on my dips were less severe and I just need to sit and read or listen to music to pass the time instead of the uncontrollable urge to knock out.  Going to bed a little earlier each night will help as well. Recognizing when a dip was coming and not inturupting them with caffeine was the capstone.

Months of research and suffering for this post. HOPE THIS HELPS! PS: Anyone know a way I can make this a carreer? This is just the latest piece of the health puzzle I've solved for myself and others.  I really like seeing people improve and do well. Thanks

,sleep,"Hello,

Looking for some advice from fellow non-morning persons.

I've always been a ""night owl"", even as a child. It's been tempered down through the years, so now my ideal bedtime is around midnight or 1 a.m. and I'd get up at 8 or 9 a.m., which I think hardly classifies as night owl anymore (but friends disagree). I really need 8 hours of sleep to function, otherwise my (mental) health suffers very quickly.

I've got a new job and it's a lovely opportunity, for which I am very grateful, but I now have to get up at 6 to be there on time (8:30 a.m.). For me this is the middle of the night. It's also completely dark at that time. I've tried to gradually move my bedtime forward to 10 p.m. and keep my bedtime routine going (hair and skincare, reading something calming, hot water bottle), but it's not working. I'm just not tired at 10 p.m.. I've tried breathing and relaxation exercises, counting tricks etc., but no results yet. I avoid looking at the time so I do not get stuck in a loop of ""oh no, it's already xxx and I'm not asleep yet). According to my sleep tracking I fall asleep around 11:30 p.m. I am exhausted due to lack of sleep, especially mentally.

I get home from work at around 6:30 p.m and then its about an hour and a half to two hours for meal prep, cooking, eating and doing the dishes. I do not have time to meal prep in the weekend, I hate frozen food, dislike take-out and just really like a fresh and healthy home-cooked meal each day. It's also our family catch-up time. We do not have a dishwasher. Then 30 to 45 minutes for preparing for the next day and then I have about one hour of spare time before bedtime, which feels like very little, especially because at the moment I do not have the mental energy to spend it on something I actually like, just some mindless entertainment. It's really weird to be both exhausted, yet not tired enough to actually fall asleep.

I have been like this for so many years. Its horrible. I feel too tired to do anything even though I get plenty of sleep at night. I thought it was depression or anxiety but now I am medicated and it&amp;#39;s not a huge issue for me. Still exhausted. Getting up and moving helps but the second I am still again I start to fall asleep. I fell asleep driving home from work the other day and (luckily) was woken up when I started to veer off the road and felt the car get bumpy. I am in college taking classes twice a week and it is so hard to  get work done because, well, I have to sit still and work. If I am physically moving I am fine.

We are assuming it is sweat. He had had bladder issues at night until around his 12th birthday. However, his whole shirt, body, and blanket were being soaked so it didn't seem to be the cause. I'm no expert though.

He is currently in Track and Field at his school, and his drinking varies. Usually he drinks about 32-48 oz a day, but sometimes up to 64 oz or down to 16 oz sometimes. usually more than that, but it happened once. 

I may make a follow up post/edit this one with more advanced information in the form of a chart, but that'll be for later.

Typically, after 2100 he stops drinking water besides a mug of chamomile tea, goes to bed at around 2130, and falls asleep before 2200.

I exercise well and I eat ok - at least about the same thing as my roommates, who don’t have problems. I also see a psychologist.

Another doctor told me that it’s because of my depression (I have been taking antidepressors for 10 years), but is not giving me solutions. In addition to that, another doctor told me I was probably not depressed but had ADD, and that was why I didn’t manage to stop my medicine for depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I exercise well and I eat ok - at least about the same thing as my roommates, who don’t have problems. I also see a psychologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of problems intertwined and I don’t know what is significant, what can have an impact, etc. I don’t know where to start. Do you have any suggestions? Thank you for your help!&lt;/p&gt;

So I have had this problem on and off for years now. 

When I am awoken or wake up in the middle or right after falling asleep I feel nauseous. I have never been sick but it feels like I am about to. After a few moments of collecting myself, usually for about 10-20 mins, I am fine and can go back to sleep.

I feel like most of this gets wrapped up in my own emetaphobia. I have a constant fear of being sick to the point where I am always checking my food, but discreetly and I only avoid chicken so often and certain places that I feel like are not clean enough. Since finding out that if you are to be sick or have food poisoning that you wake up in the middle of the night, every time I do wake up I have this in the back of my mind. 

I am not waking up every night with this feeling. 98% of the time I am totally fine.

I usually go through episodes of a couple days where I get this. At one point a year or two ago it got so bad I would have it for a week straight and have to sleep with a bucket next to my bed- just in case.

My nose was absolutely dry but still couldn't breathe out of both my nostrils.

It lasted for bout a week, but one time i stopped taking it due to depression.
When i started taking it again, the nose blockage started, but this time its been weeks and i can't breathe well most of the time.

I tried nasal spray, warm salt water through the nose, nose strips to keep your nostrils open, still hasn't gone away.
Those things help but its pretty much been a month.

My nose was absolutely dry but still couldn&amp;#39;t breathe out of both my nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It lasted for bout a week, but one time i stopped taking it due to depression.
When i started taking it again, the nose blockage started, but this time its been weeks and i can&amp;#39;t breathe well most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried nasal spray, warm salt water through the nose, nose strips to keep your nostrils open, still hasn&amp;#39;t gone away.
Those things help but its pretty much been a month.&lt;/p&gt;

,sleep,"**TLDR**: I was able to go MONTHS without waking up to the bathroom after changing my diet (after 2 years of every night waking up).  I think dairy might cause nocturia. If not, it's likely either sugar, bread or red meat, or a combo of the 4.  I started eating crappy, now I'm waking up every night again.

**Longer Version:**  
I used to be able to drink gallons of water before going to bed and not wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. This was my life in my 20s, most of my 30s. I barely ever remember waking up my whole life to use the restroom.

Then around I'd say 39 year old, I started waking up at night. I called the doctor and the answer was ""oh once a night is normal for your age"".

So now I just accepted it as a fact for my age.

It then went to twice a night. And it was EVERY night for about 2 years straight, I'd never not wake up.

Oddly, when I have a flu or cold, I wake up about 3-4 times a night.

I started thinking maybe I have a UTI or some other issue. I took some tests with the urologist and they found nothing.

Anyway one day, unrelated to Nocturia, I decided to ""try eating vegan for a week"".

I'm pretty much a pescatarian anyway so it wasn't too too hard.

In addition to eating vegan, I cut eating bread &amp; sugar too.

I basically just ate fruits + vegetables + quinoa + beans + greens. All organic.

I'd make it about 7 days then would feel like I needed protein and would maybe eat 6 eggs, then go another day of say 5 days of vegan.

This went on for about 1 month.

Then, to my surprise, I didn't wake up to urinate. Then, I made it a 2nd day, then a 3rd. I may have woken up once in 7 days. I couldn't believe it.

I ended up going back to pescatarian diet. I cut sugar + bread. I also cut these unsweetened greek yogurts I was eating like crazy.

Then, for MONTHS, I stopped waking up at all!

About 2 weeks ago, I was super hungry. I drove by a Roast beef sandwich place late at night that I used to frequent when I was younger. I thought hmmm, what's just 1 Roast Beef, I probably need the iron or some nutrients anyway. I get in there and order a ""Super beef"". I also got BBQ sauce on it (which I realized after was loaded with corn syrup). I ended up getting 2 grilled cheeses too. First time having dairy in months.

Then, I happened to see some ""vegan yogurts unsweetened"" in my refrigerator. I ended up eating about 10 of those. Now I want cake, candy, fell into my old ways. I ate junk for 2 weeks. Cannoli's, pizza, everything.

Now, after months -- I'm waking up EVERY night again. Last night was almost twice (it should have been twice but I was fighting not to get up).

I'm still not sure what caused all of this, but here are the culprits:

* DAIRY
* Red Meat
* Sugar
* Bread
* Probiotics from yogurt is suspect too, but I am not sure. It also has some ""Pectin"" in it and also upset my stomach

I still haven't pinpointed which of the above 5 it is. I don't drink alcohol either.

If I had to guess 1... I'd say dairy. I have a feeling it's the dairy. The reason is I had sweets and a little bit of red meat during the MONTHS of not waking up.

Anyway, starting today.... I am staying away from ALL dairy, ALL red meat, ALL sugar, ALL bread and away from those probiotic yogurts.

One of those caused it -- so if you're eating one or some of those, try cutting all of those because I'm 100% sure my diet was the cause of miserable nocturia.

  
**EDIT:**   I forgot to mention a 6th possibility:   SALT.     I think salt might have something to do with it as well.   I will eat at least some as our bodies need it, but high sodium could also be a factor nocturia.    I'll post more when I have more data.

I’ve had about 4 encounters of serious sleep paralysis but I managed to make it stop once I stopped sleeping on my back. I’m thankful it hasn’t happened again in about a year now because it is so frightening I literally always end up crying. 

Anyway, moving on to recent events. 

About two months ago when moving back in with my parents for the holidays, I fell asleep, about 40 mins after, I opened my eyes and I saw this massive, I mean MASSIVE spider from the top of my door launch towards my face. I quite literally screamed and threw the duvet over it, ran out my room and woke up my parents, told them this massive thing is under my duvet (because at this point I didn’t know it wasn’t real) I was so scared and it ended up (of course) being nothing. 
I was tripping out, seriously because I was so tired and was confused to why it felt so real, I saw it, I could move, it was like I even sat there looking at it for a second. 

To try to not let this happen again, I have been leaving the bathroom light on. Moved on with my life, but just an hour ago (yes im writing this as we speak of this second event because I need to talk about it) I fell asleep at 1.20am, around 1.45am I opened my eyes and looked in the hallway, saw this black creature with legs, walking towards me, slowly, it had these big green eyes and I remember thinking “what the f** is that” I looked at it for a second to try to understand what just got into my room, but as it kept creeping forward to me I realised it was still there and I wasn’t tripping, I jumped up and locked myself in my bathroom, heart racing not understanding what the heck is in my bedroom hallway, it took a bit of courage but I opened my door and of course (I knew this like there’s no way it’s real) nothing was there. 

I don’t know if this has anything to do with sleep paralysis or tiredness, stress, worry or something more spiritual since I have been strengthening my connection with God but I don’t see how this could be related. I love sleep, it’s so nice and I hate how this happened like wdym???

,sleep,"Hi, I am 33M, 5'8"", 135 lbs, total sleep 6.5 hrs on avg. (fragmented), HRV 45 ms, 53 Resting Heart Rate.

I have been waking up in the middle of the night everyday with fragmented sleep for a very long time.

I don't even remember when I had a good night of sleep last time.

There are a few things I am suspecting that may contribute to this for me:

1. Celiac Disease - When I wake up, I often notice that my stomach is gassy (lots of farts lol) and uncomfortable. It feels similar to hunger, but rarely painful. When I ate pasta and cheese cake at Cheese Cake Factory last time, I woke up at 2 a.m. and had 11 bowel movements that day. I normally go 2\~3 times a day, usually first thing in the morning.
2. Environmental Allergies - I am very allergic to mountain cedar and other tree pollens, grass, mold, etc. Whenever I wake up in the middle of the night, I notice one side of my nose (left or right) is stuffed, so I can't breathe well. I've been using Allegra, nasal spray, and NeilMed Sinus Kit to no avail. I am considering allergy shots, but I am concerned about its potential effect.
3. LPR (Silent Reflux) - I was diagnosed with Grade A reflux esophagitis and non-erosive gastritis, and I sometimes feel acid or some liquid climbing up my esophagus, but I never feel heartburn. I am trying Gaviscon tablet, but not helping much, so I may not have LPR after all, but who knows. I just ordered an adjustable base for my bed, so we will see if this helps.
4. Anxiety - I am a health freak, and just very sensitive person in general. I worry a lot about how to optimize my sleep and health, especially because I haven't been getting quality sleep for a very long time. However, I personally don't believe that I have anxiety issues, but my wife and my parents tell me that I do have anxiety as I worry a lot about my wellbeing. I am considering therapy, but haven't started because like I said, I don't think I have anxiety. I just care a lot about my health and longevity.
5. Depression - I don't think I am depressed at all because I love many things in my life and I am fairly optimistic person. However, when I don't get much sleep and wake up at like 2 a.m. and can't fall back asleep, I do get very emotional and a split second of emptiness and meaninglessness crosses my mind. I am also an atheist, so I do believe that there is no universal meaning of life and I do feel that life is sometimes ""meaningless,"" even though I have many things I enjoy in my life.
6. Narcolepsy - I do feel very tired in the afternoon, especially between noon and 5 p.m. I once fell asleep briefly while driving and hit a car in front of me very slightly. I am not sure if this is because I am not getting enough sleep daily due to some reason or if I indeed have mild narcolepsy. My neurologist wants me to come in for sleep study, so I may find out more soon. I am not sure if I have narcolepsy though because most people I know are tired in the afternoon, and I think my fatigue may be stemming from my insomnia, not narcolepsy, but we will find out soon.

I really want to get my sleep under control, because it has been more than a decade since I had a normal, quality sleep. My next steps will be to try the following:

1. Gluten-free diet
2. Start immunotherapy
3. Sleep on adjustable bed
4. Talk to therapist about potential anxiety.
5. Go do sleep study.

Has anyone suffered from any of these with similar symptoms (sleep maintenance insomnia) and seen improvements? If so, can you share me what worked well for you?

I really appreciate the help!",t2_3xt7xd9m,False,,0,False,Sleep Maintenance Insomnia - My Potential Causes,[],r/sleep,False,6,,0,,False,t3_1fxfda7,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,1728218204.0,,[],{},,True,,1728217742.0,text,6,,,text,self.sleep,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am 33M, 5&amp;#39;8&amp;quot;, 135 lbs, total sleep 6.5 hrs on avg. (fragmented), HRV 45 ms, 53 Resting Heart Rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been waking up in the middle of the night everyday with fragmented sleep for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even remember when I had a good night of sleep last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things I am suspecting that may contribute to this for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celiac Disease - When I wake up, I often notice that my stomach is gassy (lots of farts lol) and uncomfortable. It feels similar to hunger, but rarely painful. When I ate pasta and cheese cake at Cheese Cake Factory last time, I woke up at 2 a.m. and had 11 bowel movements that day. I normally go 2~3 times a day, usually first thing in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environmental Allergies - I am very allergic to mountain cedar and other tree pollens, grass, mold, etc. Whenever I wake up in the middle of the night, I notice one side of my nose (left or right) is stuffed, so I can&amp;#39;t breathe well. I&amp;#39;ve been using Allegra, nasal spray, and NeilMed Sinus Kit to no avail. I am considering allergy shots, but I am concerned about its potential effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LPR (Silent Reflux) - I was diagnosed with Grade A reflux esophagitis and non-erosive gastritis, and I sometimes feel acid or some liquid climbing up my esophagus, but I never feel heartburn. I am trying Gaviscon tablet, but not helping much, so I may not have LPR after all, but who knows. I just ordered an adjustable base for my bed, so we will see if this helps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anxiety - I am a health freak, and just very sensitive person in general. I worry a lot about how to optimize my sleep and health, especially because I haven&amp;#39;t been getting quality sleep for a very long time. However, I personally don&amp;#39;t believe that I have anxiety issues, but my wife and my parents tell me that I do have anxiety as I worry a lot about my wellbeing. I am considering therapy, but haven&amp;#39;t started because like I said, I don&amp;#39;t think I have anxiety. I just care a lot about my health and longevity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depression - I don&amp;#39;t think I am depressed at all because I love many things in my life and I am fairly optimistic person. However, when I don&amp;#39;t get much sleep and wake up at like 2 a.m. and can&amp;#39;t fall back asleep, I do get very emotional and a split second of emptiness and meaninglessness crosses my mind. I am also an atheist, so I do believe that there is no universal meaning of life and I do feel that life is sometimes &amp;quot;meaningless,&amp;quot; even though I have many things I enjoy in my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narcolepsy - I do feel very tired in the afternoon, especially between noon and 5 p.m. I once fell asleep briefly while driving and hit a car in front of me very slightly. I am not sure if this is because I am not getting enough sleep daily due to some reason or if I indeed have mild narcolepsy. My neurologist wants me to come in for sleep study, so I may find out more soon. I am not sure if I have narcolepsy though because most people I know are tired in the afternoon, and I think my fatigue may be stemming from my insomnia, not narcolepsy, but we will find out soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to get my sleep under control, because it has been more than a decade since I had a normal, quality sleep. My next steps will be to try the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gluten-free diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start immunotherapy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep on adjustable bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to therapist about potential anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go do sleep study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
